<h1>The Team</h1>
<hr/>

<h2>Editors</h2>

<h4>Richard Lowe</h4>
<p>Founder of SMP, Richard's love of films began when he watched a rerun of <i>Mary Poppins</i> aged four and showed his appreciation by dancing in the aisle. Three decades later, he has managed to retain his enthusiasm about film despite watching more rubbish than any one person should have to suffer.</p>

<p>He generally like most types of films with the possible exception of sickly sweet romance stories or tales of domestic strife and violence. If pressed to name five of his favourite films they would have to be <i>Blade Runner</i> (WARNING: if you bring this up in conversation, be prepared to lose several hours of your life), <i>The Godfather</i>, <i>The Blues Brothers</i>, <i>Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>Where Eagles Dare</i>.</p>

<h4>Melanie Dayasena</h4>

<p>Co-founder of SMP, Mel handles more responsibilities than everyone else put together and the site would probably limp its way to a slow death without her. She organises press-screenings, edits reviews, chases late submissions and even writes her own reviews. She is a huge fan of Justin Timberlake which is just wrong, but then she loves orang-utans so all is well.</p> 

<p>Mel likes to watch romantic comedies and action films, and in extenuating circumstances can be convinced to watch science fiction but only if Richard agrees to watch a soppy romantic comedy or a horror film in return. All's fair in love and war.</p>

<h2>Reviewers</h2>

<h4>Luke Brennand</h4>

<p>After studying English and History, followed by Journalism, Luke lay low in a job at Woolworths for six and a half years before finally quitting to find himself a real job and tackle the world of journalism. He lists his favourite films as <i>Aliens</i>, <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> and <i>LA Confidential</i>.</p>

<h4>Tom Seaman</h4>

<p>Hailing from the wonderful seaside town of Bognor Regis, Tom's day job involves frequent trips around the world looking at carp and snapper. We have no idea what his favourite films are but he gave <a href=""<i>Daywatch</i></a> and <a href=""><i>The Counterfeiters</i></a> five stars each, so they will do for now.</p>

<h4>Abigail Murphy</h4>

<p>Abi is a recent addition to the SMP team, if by recent you mean about five years ago, and prefers off the wall random films as they make for easier reviews. Her favourite films include <i>The Shawshank Redemption</i>, <i>Pan's Labyrinth</i>, <i>The Usual Suspects</i> and <i>All About my Mother</i> - films that make you laugh and cry in the same minute, real people, real stories mixed in with fantastical mind bending stuff and hilarity, oooh and a bit of action and romance thrown in too.</p>

<h4>Nick Nicolaou</h4>
<p>You have to give Nick credit for perseverance. The first film SMP sent him to review is the <a href="../../eiga/reviews/792/">worst film he's ever seen</a> and yet he's still here. He loves anime, sci-fi and fantasy films and counts <i>The Bounty</i> (the 1984 version) and <i>Spirited Away</i> amongst his favourites. If he had to share his popcorn with someone other than his wife, it would be Vanessa Hudgens or Hayao Miyazaki, although he confesses that he'd just stare at one and poke the brain of the other, which is possibly too much information.</p>

<h4>Namrata Nadkarni</h4>

<p>Having successfully evaded the UK Borders Agency for almost a decade, Namrata has finally secured permanent residency by proving that she is able to learn more <a href="http://www.ukcitizenshiptest.co.uk/">useless knowledge about Britain</a> than its indigenous people. She'll <a href="insert review link here!">see anything</a> but prefers comedies and sci-fi.</p>

<h4>Pratiksha Patel</h4>

<p>Born and brought up in Wembley, Pratiksha has been instrumental in securing Namrata's permanent residency through her contacts in the FOB underground network. As a newly qualified teacher, Pratiksha is used to being locked in a room with a horde of children, an excellent qualification for film reviewing. In her spare time she likes to run, play football, write subtitles for Indian movies and correct local Indian restaurant menus (that's Kwality with a "K").</p>

<h4>Balasundaram Lavan</h4>

<p>When not devoting offline bandwidth to facilitating collaborative wine-tasting infrastructures, architecting credit card initiatives or <a href="http://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ">Rickrolling</a> Sinhalese charities, Lavan leverages his core competencies to bring to the table a high-level view of SMP's deliverables and a recontextualisation of quick-win solutions. That is to say he writes reviews, but you knew that already.</p>

<h4>Sanjeet Sehmi</h4>
<p>Feeling left out after all of his fellow chemists became accountants or management consultants (*coughs*Lavan*coughs*), Sanj became a researcher to further the scientific knowledge of humankind and, as an unfortunate side-effect, help better the profits of a multi-national pharmaceutical company. He atones for his sins by writing for SMP, with an emphasis on music documentaries, but with the knowledge that his parents will forgive everything if he fulfils his filial duty by getting married and having kids like every other good Indian child.</p>

<h4>Ruth Furness</h4>
<p>Graduating in 2011 with an English Lit degree, Ruth works as a marketing minion at the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra but hopes in future to be paid to write (or indeed, just paid). She loves to read, dance, bake and do pub quizzes. Her favourite films include <i>The Sting</i>, <i>Jurassic Park</i>, <i>The Commitments</i>, <i>Billy Elliot</i>, anything by Pixar and a good action film.</p>
	
<h2>Administrator (aka the Code Monkey)</h2>
<h4><a href="/static/eiga/html/lal.html" title="Lalâ€™s questionnaire">Lalith Vipulananthan</a></h4>

<p>Holding the record for the latest SMP review of all time (six months fact fans) and responsible for the website revamp, Lal is currently an unemployed bum who spends most of his free time playing games or watching films. When he isn't doing either of those he works on the next iteration of SMP and occasionally looks for a job. He likes anime, kung fu and sub-titled films and will occasional lower his standards to watch something mainstream so he can justify his opinion on why it's shit.</p>
