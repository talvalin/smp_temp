1	/about/team/	The SMP team	<h1>The Team</h1>\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n<h2>Editors</h2>\r\n\r\n<h4>Richard Lowe</h4>\r\n<p>Founder of SMP, Richard's love of films began when he watched a rerun of <i>Mary Poppins</i> aged four and showed his appreciation by dancing in the aisle. Three decades later, he has managed to retain his enthusiasm about film despite watching more rubbish than any one person should have to suffer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He generally like most types of films with the possible exception of sickly sweet romance stories or tales of domestic strife and violence. If pressed to name five of his favourite films they would have to be <i>Blade Runner</i> (WARNING: if you bring this up in conversation, be prepared to lose several hours of your life), <i>The Godfather</i>, <i>The Blues Brothers</i>, <i>Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>Where Eagles Dare</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Melanie Dayasena</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Co-founder of SMP, Mel handles more responsibilities than everyone else put together and the site would probably limp its way to a slow death without her. She organises press-screenings, edits reviews, chases late submissions and even writes her own reviews. She is a huge fan of Justin Timberlake which is just wrong, but then she loves orang-utans so all is well.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Mel likes to watch romantic comedies and action films, and in extenuating circumstances can be convinced to watch science fiction but only if Richard agrees to watch a soppy romantic comedy or a horror film in return. All's fair in love and war.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Reviewers</h2>\r\n\r\n<h4>Luke Brennand</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>After studying English and History, followed by Journalism, Luke lay low in a job at Woolworths for six and a half years before finally quitting to find himself a real job and tackle the world of journalism. He lists his favourite films as <i>Aliens</i>, <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> and <i>LA Confidential</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Tom Seaman</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Hailing from the wonderful seaside town of Bognor Regis, Tom's day job involves frequent trips around the world looking at carp and snapper. We have no idea what his favourite films are but he gave <a href=""<i>Daywatch</i></a> and <a href=""><i>The Counterfeiters</i></a> five stars each, so they will do for now.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Abigail Murphy</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Abi is a recent addition to the SMP team, if by recent you mean about five years ago, and prefers off the wall random films as they make for easier reviews. Her favourite films include <i>The Shawshank Redemption</i>, <i>Pan's Labyrinth</i>, <i>The Usual Suspects</i> and <i>All About my Mother</i> - films that make you laugh and cry in the same minute, real people, real stories mixed in with fantastical mind bending stuff and hilarity, oooh and a bit of action and romance thrown in too.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Nick Nicolaou</h4>\r\n<p>You have to give Nick credit for perseverance. The first film SMP sent him to review is the <a href="../../eiga/reviews/792/">worst film he's ever seen</a> and yet he's still here. He loves anime, sci-fi and fantasy films and counts <i>The Bounty</i> (the 1984 version) and <i>Spirited Away</i> amongst his favourites. If he had to share his popcorn with someone other than his wife, it would be Vanessa Hudgens or Hayao Miyazaki, although he confesses that he'd just stare at one and poke the brain of the other, which is possibly too much information.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Namrata Nadkarni</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Having successfully evaded the UK Borders Agency for almost a decade, Namrata has finally secured permanent residency by proving that she is able to learn more <a href="http://www.ukcitizenshiptest.co.uk/">useless knowledge about Britain</a> than its indigenous people. She'll <a href="insert review link here!">see anything</a> but prefers comedies and sci-fi.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Pratiksha Patel</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Born and brought up in Wembley, Pratiksha has been instrumental in securing Namrata's permanent residency through her contacts in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresh_off_the_boat">FOB</a> underground network. As a newly qualified teacher, Pratiksha is used to being locked in a room with a horde of children, an excellent qualification for film reviewing. In her spare time she likes to run, play football, write subtitles for Indian movies and correct local Indian restaurant menus (that's Kwality with a "K").</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Balasundaram Lavan</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>When not devoting offline bandwidth to facilitating collaborative pressed-grape sampling infrastructures, architecting credit card initiatives or <a href="http://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ">reverting back</a> to Sinhalese charities, Lavan leverages his core competencies to bring to the table a high-level view of SMP's deliverables and a recontextualisation of quick-win solutions. That is to say he writes reviews, but you knew that already.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Sanjeet Sehmi</h4>\r\n<p>Feeling left out after all of his fellow chemists became accountants or management consultants (*coughs*Lavan*coughs*), Sanj became a researcher to further the scientific knowledge of humankind and, as an unfortunate side-effect, help better the profits of a multi-national pharmaceutical company. He atones for his sins by writing for SMP, with an emphasis on music documentaries, but with the knowledge that his parents will forgive everything if he fulfils his filial duty by getting married and having kids like every other good Indian child.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Ruth Furness</h4>\r\n<p>Graduating in 2011 with an English Lit degree, Ruth works as a marketing minion at the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra but hopes in future to be paid to write (or indeed, just paid). She loves to read, dance, bake and do pub quizzes. Her favourite films include <i>The Sting</i>, <i>Jurassic Park</i>, <i>The Commitments</i>, <i>Billy Elliot</i>, anything by Pixar and a good action film.</p>\r\n\t\r\n<h2>Administrator (aka the Code Monkey)</h2>\r\n<h4><a href="/static/eiga/html/lal.html" title="Lal’s questionnaire">Lalith Vipulananthan</a></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Holding the record for the latest SMP review of all time (six months fact fans) and responsible for the website revamp, Lal is currently an unemployed bum who spends most of his free time playing games or watching films. When he isn't doing either of those he works on the next iteration of SMP and occasionally looks for a job. He likes anime, kung fu and sub-titled films and will occasional lower his standards to watch something mainstream so he can justify his opinion on why it's shit.</p>	f		f

656	1	20	\N	Bolt	<p>\r\nEvery so often out of nowhere a surprise movie pops up and this can be both good and bad. Amid the hype of recent blockbusters, the movie <b>Taken</b> has slowly been moving towards its release date.\r\n</p><p>\r\nDirector Pierre Morel (District 13) and writer/producer Luc Besson (Arthur and the Invisibles) have quietly been making a vengeance flick starring... Liam Neeson (Seraphim Falls)? Neeson is a seriously heavy weight actor having starred in movies such as <i> 'Kingdom of Heaven'</i>, <i> 'The Mission'</i> and <i> 'Michael Collins'</i>, but has also appeared in popcorn movies like 'Batman Begins' and 'Love Actually'. Still it is a surprise to see him in a fairly clich vengeance movie.\r\n</p><p>\r\nNeeson stars as Bryan, an obsessive ex-government agent who is trying too late to reconnect with his teenage daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace - The Jane Austen Book Club). Shortly after her birthday Kim and a friend head off on a holiday to Paris. No sooner do they arrive and they are abducted but not before Kim has a tearful frightened conversation with her dad.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSo the thin well trodden path is laid before us. Bryan, the vengeful father, heads off to Paris to rescue his daughter and kill those who kidnapped her. His journey is swift, violent and merciless. There aren't any real hidden subplots or metaphors here; this is just a direct brutal action movie.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAs a brainless action movie this film hits the spot better than one of Neeson's many well placed punches. The film also has a sense of style and frenetic activity similar to the 'Bourne' movies, if not so refined or subtle. Do you detect a 'but' coming? This movie has lots of good ingredients but somehow doesn't stand out as a great. \r\n</p><p>\r\nI think one fault is the utter lack of characterisation. We only meet the daughter for a few moments before she is abducted so we don't really connect with her, meanwhile Bryan is a cold killing machine with one objective so there isn't much to warm to there either. The lack of any real subplot means you just watch the carnage unfold with little or no suspense.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOther critics have made a big thing about how this movie stumbles from one racial stereotype to another (sleazy French men, crooked Albanians, greedy Arab Sheiks and dizzy American teenagers) and basically warns Americans never to leave their country for fear of the evil foreigners. As this film was written, directed, and produced by Europeans that would suggest they are all either playing to the American crowd for the money or maybe hatching a genius plot to rid our historic cities of annoying tourists, either way the criticism seems a bit harsh, if well founded. \r\n</p><p>\r\nFor fans of relentless vendetta movies such as <i>'The Bourne Ultimatum'</i>, <i> 'Man on Fire'</i> or <i> 'Get Carter'</i>, this film is a thin but fun treat. However if you were hoping for something special from the creative team behind 'Leon' and the actor of <i> 'Rob Roy'</i> and <i> 'Schindler's List'</i>, you may feel a bit let down.\r\n</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	656	2011-03-26
1	1	16	Gender switch remake of 80s classic <i>Big</i>	13 Going On 30	<p>In the latest homage to 80s classic <i>Big</i>, a tale of overnight transformation from teen to adulthood, Jennifer Garner (Daredevil) fills Tom Hanks's shoes as the troubled teen-turned adult.</p>\r\n<p>Jenna Rink (young Christa B. Allen) is 13 and is facing the usual teenage growing pains.  She desperately wants to be part of the beautiful Six Chicks group, led by Lucy Wyman, but instead she is ridiculed and branded the school geek.  The only person she can rely on is her best friend, and fellow geek, Matt.</p><p>One day, after falling foul of a school prank, Jenna makes a wish to fast forward her teenage years and become 30!</p> <p>The next day Jenna (now Jennifer Garner) wakes up to find herself in new surroundings, with a half-naked man in her flat and no sign of her parents anywhere.  Plus, she looks a lot older than she did the night before!</p><p>Dazed and confused by her new found maturity and surroundings, Jenna doesn't have a chance to stop and think as she is whisked away to work. Jenna, it would appear, is a big time magazine editor even though she still feels and acts like a 13-year-old!</p><p>Jenna soon realises that adult life is not all it is cracked up to be and that being successful is not always the key to popularity. To try and piece together the 17 years she has lost, Jenna tracks down her best friend Matt (Mark Ruffalo - <i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</i>) to try and help her retrace her life.</p>\r\n<p>In a twist to the original <i>Big</i> story, Jenna and her friends are all transported forward in time to adulthood.  She still thinks feels and acts like a 13-year-old but is trapped in a 30-year-old's body and lifestyle.</p><p>Jennifer Garner plays a lighter and girlier character compared to her previous grittier roles in <i>Daredevil</i> and <i>Alias</i>. In what could have been a well trodden role, Garner shines out as a real talent combining physical comedy with delicate and emotive drama. Similarly Mark Ruffalo puts in a solid performance as the love interest and provides a great dance partner for Garner in the hilarious Thriller dance sequence.  Praise should also be given to Andy Serkis for his touch of comedy as camp off-the-wall editor Richard.</p><p>All in all <i>13 Going on 30</i> is a solid family movie that stands apart from its obvious comparator, <i>Big</i>, and should bring a smile to your face.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	1	2012-01-13
11	1	16	\N	Mean Girls	<p>Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan - Freaky Friday) is South African born and bred and she is more than capable of protecting herself from dangerous wild animals in the African jungle.  But when she moves to America with her parents she is faced with an even worse type of predator - the high school teen!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cady has never been ostracised or had to try to win friends and she finds the transition from home schooling to be pretty tough.  She just can't seem to find a group of kids that will accept her and she eventually resorts to eating lunch on her own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a few days she is befriended by goth girl Janis (Lizzy Caplan - Orange County) and camp guy Damian (Daniel Franzese) who take pity on her and educate Cady on the rules and cliques of the school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She is warned off the popular bitchy "Plastics", led by blonde Regina (Rachel McAdams - The Notebook), but Cady soon finds herself being asked to join the Plastics, much to the surprise of her "outsider" friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Janis and Damian hatch a plan to use Cady as an "insider" to ridicule the Plastics by uncovering their deepest darkest secrets and exposing them for the "bitches' they really are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But along the way Cady falls for a guy, the wrong guy.  She hadn't planned on getting a crush on Regina's ex-boyfriend, Aaron Samuels (Jonathon Bennett)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Regina tries to steal back Aaron, Cady plans Regina's downfall.  But what she doesn't realise is that Regina also has her own plan up her sleeve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mean Girls is a really entertaining teen flick with plenty of laugh-out-loud scenes and good acting.  Newcomer Lindsay Lohan convincingly plays an innocent new student turned bitchy bimbo in another leading role following her debut in Freaky Friday.  Other solid performances come from Rachel McAdams and Lacey Chabert (Daddy Day Care) as Gretchen, another of the 'popular' Plastics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mean Girls falls within the well-trodden genre of pretty people and teen angst.  If you enjoyed films like Cruel Intentions, She's All That and Drop Dead Gorgeous then I recommend you see this film.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	11	2011-03-26

549	1	20	In short, a film with fairly good action and effects but no story	10,000 BC	<p>Lots of people have slated this film and a few have given it a better than expected write up. It's a tricky one to decide between as the film is generally crap but were we really expecting anything deep and complex? This film is aimed at a young audience who love action, big beasts, and a hint of magic and for them it delivers but the boat load. For anyone hoping for some decent characterisation, a good script, or any kind of historical accuracy then this becomes comical in its failure.</p>\r\n<p>German director Roland Emmerich has previously dazzled us with his wide vistas and tremendous effects in films such as <i>Independence Day</i>, <i>Godzilla</i>, and <i>The Day After Tomorrow</i>. If anything, this movie is more reminiscent of these three films' predecessor, the often overlooked <i>Stargate</i>.</p>\r\n<p>Set in the good old days when our predecessors lived in snowy wastes sporting dreadlocks, the story begins with a prophecy read out by the ever brilliant Omar Sharif (One Night with the King) who acts as narrator should the thin story escape any who slipped into a coma. The prophecy tells of a time when the mammoths stop visiting the valley and a lone warrior will set out on a quest to save his people after they are attacked by four legged demons. The warrior will be the one who loves the girl with the blue eyes and kills the first mammoth in the final year of their visit.</p>\r\n<p>Sure enough the film leaps forward to see our hero with dreadlocks fight for the affections of a blue eyed girl just before their village is attacked by slavers on horseback (four legged demons). Determined to reclaim the woman he loves our hero sets off on a quest ably assisted by the cliche best friend, old wise warrior and the uninvited young kid. Their quest leads them through frozen wastes, luscious jungle, burning deserts, and eventually to a confrontation with an advanced evil and the exciting climax.</p>\r\n<p>Set up as a straight forward cliche we know where this movie will go, who will die, and what will happen in the end but is it too much to ask for some small surprises? Or even a bit of insightful glances at our predecessors? The small naive town being attacked by slavers, the lone hero, the encounter with the advanced enemy, is all very <i>Apocalypto</i> but without the visceral edge. Meanwhile the Egyptian-like super intelligent evil baddies are very <i>Stargate</i>.</p>\r\n<p>Trying to redeem this movie there are some nice action sequences and the actors do try their best with what little script there is. Steven Strait (The Covenant) will get the girls excited as the hero <i>DiLeh</i> with bulging muscles, lengthy dreads and conveniently no body hair to hide his six-pack. Meanwhile for us lads there are only faint glimpses of an often sack covered Camille Belle (<i>When a Stranger Calls</i>) as the love interest Evolet. Belle doesn't really have to say much and being covered in hessian most of the movie makes you wonder if it is worth all the hassle after all but I suppose without her theyíd be no story at all. Adding gravitas to this movie is... er... Sharif as the narrator and er... Cliff Curtis (the FBI guy in <i>Die Hard 4</i>).</p>\r\n<p>So in short, fairly good action and effects with no story; the brain dead will love it! This is recommended for fans of cliche action adventures, a love of muscled men in little outfits, or for people with short attention spans.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	549	2012-03-11
144	1	12	\N	The Interpreter	<p>With her mixed heritage, international upbringing, and fluency in different languages, Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman - The Hours) epitomises the United Nations. Working as an interpreter at the UN building in New York, Silvia overhears a conversation about an assassination plot against an African leader, Zuwahnie. Zuwahnie is under fire from the UN for ethnic cleansing, and plans to address the UN assembly to justify his actions. This is his last chance to avoid being charged with crimes against humanity and he will not be dissuaded from speaking, even when Silvia's information comes to light. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>No one takes Silvia seriously, least of all Tobin Keller (Sean Penn - 21\r\nGrams), the Secret Service agent assigned to protect Zuwahnie during his stay in the US. When a threat is made against Silvia's life, Keller begins to investigate more thoroughly and finds that though there may be substance to her claims, Silvia Broome is not who she appears to be. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the first hour or so The Interpreter comes across like a 70s thriller, the type where the plot twists and turns with little explanation, leaving the viewer to piece things together for themselves. The direction is assured and expressive, and the two leads carry themselves well in their respective roles: Penn as the traumatised Secret Service agent and Kidman as the secretive and vulnerable outsider. For a thriller the dialogue is surprisingly funny, without descending into farce. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film peaks with a gripping sequence set on a bus, where Broome confronts Kuman-Kuman, one of Zuwhanie's rivals, and Keller's group of Secret Service agents find themselves tailing their assigned targets all on to the same vehicle. At the onset it's comical, but the tension increases rapidly as Keller tries desperately to co-ordinate his agents and find out what is going on without them blowing their covers. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only problem is that this occurs at the end of the second reel, and from there the film meanders slowly downhill to an anti-climatic end. By now it should be clear to the viewer what is going on (aided by a fairly explicit explanation by one character), except it takes Keller and company another thirty minutes to work it out for themselves. Unlike Kidman's shifting accent, the arbitrary creation of a rare African dialect, and the fact that Kidman is surprisingly pale for a woman who has spent her childhood living in Africa, the simple matter of Keller's inability to decipher the transparent plot is what diminishes this otherwise excellent film. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, The Interpreter is a good film, but one that could and should have been much more.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	144	2011-03-26
149	1	13	\N	The Machinist	<p>Anything I say will give this film away part from the fact that Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale - Equilibrium) is an industrialist machinist who has not slept in almost a year and man does it look like it. This insomnia has left Reznic unable to distinguish between reality and his dreams. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Machinist is a great little film that was actually shot in Barcelona but made to look like the US. The script itself was a spec script written as a test and never meant to be filmed until Christian Bale got hold of it. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christian Bale himself has come a long way from the little cute kid in Empire of the Sun. One of the first scenes is where you get a good look at his backbone and by backbone I meant you can see every ridge and knob on his spine that will make you shudder. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only complaint is that I was itching to look at my watch. I was trying not to, knowing the film would unfold in its own time, but it ran a little too slow. Sadly you will probably get to the end of this film and not care at all how it ends. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But nonetheless I have to admire Christian Bale's weight loss. Bale endured a diet regiment so severe to reach the desired waif like dimensions of Reznik that it must have been a real test of his dedication and commitment. Can of tuna and an apple a day to lose the weight. Must try that as a diet. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only parallel I can draw with this film is that it is like Memento. You probably have to watch it twice to appreciate it.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	149	2011-03-26
153	1	16	\N	The Amityville Horror	<p>Based on a supposedly true story and a remake of the original 1979 movie of the same name, The Amityville Horror tells the tale of a family bloodbath and the evil that has lurked in the family home ever since.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scene is set at the DeFeo residence where son Ronald is told to murder his parents and siblings by evil voices emanating from within the house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A year later, The Lutz family move into the same house after landing a great asking price for the property.  Even after pushing the jittery estate agent to reveal the truth behind the cheap selling the price, the sceptical family still choose to move into their dream home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>George (Ryan Reynolds - Blade Trinity) and Kathy (Melissa George - Down with Love) are determined to play happy families after the death of Kathy's first husband and the children's real father.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even from day one, George starts to notice strange images and to hear odd noises in the house but puts it down to an overactive imagination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several weeks pass and more strange happenings take place.  It is only after a traumatised babysitter is carted away from the house in restraints claiming to have witnessed something sinister do the Lutz children discover the truth about the damned house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Directed by relative newcomer Andrew Douglas, this remake is a commendable stab at breaking into the horror genre and Douglas does well to keep the "fright factor" momentum going strong throughout.  With help from the prince of horror remakes Michael Bay (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) as producer, Douglas has hit the jackpot with a spine-chilling horror that supersedes both Texas Chainsaw and the latest horror flick, The Ring 2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the leading role of George Lutz, Reynolds swaps his comedic roots as wise-cracking party animal in Van Wilder and suitably buff and humorous vampire killer in Blade Trinity to play a more sinister and serious role.  George, better known for her days in Home & Away, as the doting wife successfully puts across her desperation and fear-fuelled emotion.  Even the Lutz children are played by famous child actors Jesse James (I) (The Butterfly Effect) and Jimmy Bennett (III) (Hostage).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Amityville Horror is a freaky and spine-chilling horror that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout.  Watch it if you like to be scared both visually and psychologically and if you enjoyed possession/insanity films such as The Shining or The Exorcist.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	153	2011-03-26

158	1	20	\N	Melinda And Melinda	<p>Prolific director Woody Allen directs a new and refreshing comedy noir. The premise is simple, two playwrights in a New York bistro are debating the essence of life, is comical or tragic. The comedy playwright feels the tragedy dictates life hence the popularity of comedy while the drama writer feels comedy is intrinsic to every situation, no matter how dire or dark it may seem.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>As these two writers banter the merit of each others argument, a fellow diner presents them a brief story about a love forsaken girl, Melinda (Radha Mitchell - Finding Neverland), who staggers into a dinner party unexpected. As each playwright retells the story in their comic or tragic form, a tangled diptych emerges centring on Melinda.</p>  \r\n\r\n<p>In the darker story we see a depressed and unstable Melinda tackling her recent tragic past as she stays in the home of her life long friend Laurel (Chlo Sevigny - Dogville) and her alcoholic actor husband Lee (Johnny Lee Miller - Dracula 2000). As Melinda tries to pick up her life she falls in love with a pianist, Ellis (Chiwetel Ejiofor - Love Actually). But as romance blooms as does fragile Melinda's dormant paranoia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile in the comedy story we see a very similar Melinda stagger into her new neighbour's house and capture the imagination of a downtrodden actor, Hobie (Will Farrell - Anchorman) who is feeling neglected by his successful wife Susan (Amanda Peet - The Whole Ten Yards). As Hobie's marriage wanes and his fascination with Melinda grows, his longing becomes almost comedic as he spies and lies to try to cover his emotions always with off the wall consequences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each of the two stories on their own are engaging for dissimilar reasons and when they are blended together they make a great film. As complicated as that may sound it works really well on screen. Some may draw parallels with 'Sliding Doors' but this film feels very different and the quality of acting on the whole is faultless.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>In the central role as Melinda, Radha Mitchell is captivating and although relatively unknown adds such presence to the drama and such sweet grace to the comedy that she is deserving of all the praise I may heap upon her performance. With the possible exception ofr Johnny Lee Miller's unstable accent I feel the rest of the cast added credible clout to help support the ambitious structure of the film. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I must confess that Woody Allen movies do not crowd my movie collection at home and I often find his overloading neurosis a little annoying but this film was really good and I would recommend it to anyone who feels the romance genre has grown stale.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	158	2011-03-26
161	1	16	\N	The Wedding Date	<p>Modern day dating has moved away from the traditional face to face dating and more towards speed dating and internet introductions. So when Kat Ellis (Debra Messing - Along Came Polly) was desperate to find a date for her sister's wedding, she didn't give it a second thought and flicked through the personal ads to find a man.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What could be more traumatic than having to attend your sister's wedding when your ex-fianc is going to be there? Kat was stressed enough so it seemed easier to simply hire an escort to help her save face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Welcome dashing escort Nick (Dermot Mulroney - My Best Friend's Wedding). Kat is more than pleasantly surprised when she first meets Nick and soon realises he is "worth every penny".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nick seems to be the perfect gentleman and every woman at the wedding instantly adores him. Kat just needs to keep up the pretence of how she met him and what his real profession is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cast of The Wedding Date is a mix of new American and British talent which works well in the story of an American and British wedding. Rising US stars Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney don't boast a long list of movie work but deliver promising performances. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the British side, Jack Davenport (Pirates of the Caribbean) as the groom-to-be Ed and Jeremy Sheffield (Creep) as evil ex-fianc Jeffrey both deliver truly British lingo and behaviour with style. Watch out for an amusing chase scene that is strangely reminiscent of the fight between Firth and Grant in the Bridget Jones movies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watch this film if you enjoyed My Best Friend's Wedding, Four Weddings and a Funeral or Bridget Jones. Girls, if you fancy a flash of the male posterior this film will not disappoint. Guys, to be honest this film just isn't for you.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	161	2011-03-26
164	1	16	\N	Monster-In-Law	<p>With a surge of "Meet the Parents"-style movies saturating our screens, you could be forgiven for branding Monster-in Law as yet another clich 'in-law' movie.  But, instead of having the 'intimidating father' as the main obstacle this time it's the turn of the obnoxious and vindictive mother-in-law.</P>\r\n\r\n<p>Jane Fonda (Stanley & Iris) plays high-flying TV presenter, Viola Fields, who has high hopes for her son, Dr Kevin Fields (Michael Vartan - One Hour Photo) in both his professional and personal life.</P>\r\n\r\n<p>Although mother and son haven't spent much quality time together of late, when Viola suddenly loses her job she soon realises it is about time she made a change.</P>\r\n\r\n<p>After four failed marriages and a mental breakdown, Viola realises she only has her son and faithful assistant, Ruby (Wanda Sykes - Down to Earth) to rely on.</P>\r\n\r\n<p>So it comes as a nasty shock to Viola when she realises that after such a long time apart from her son that she will have to share him with another woman.  Kevin now comes as part of a couple with girlfriend, Charlie (Jennifer Lopez - Shall We Dance), in tow.</P>\r\n\r\n<p>But Viola is not happy about having to share her son's affections and makes no effort to hide her disapproval of the situation.</P> \r\n\r\n<p>Things turn from bad to worse when Viola and Charlie get engaged and Viola starts hatching an evil plot to make sure the wedding doesn't go ahead.</P>\r\n\r\n<p>Charlie soon cottons on to what her future mother-in-law is really like and she starts to give back as good as she gets.</P>\r\n\r\n<p>Looks like neither woman will stop until she gets what she wants and their tactics just get dirtier and more vindictive.  So who will succeed in the showdown?  Watch to find out!</P>\r\n\r\n<p>J-Lo manages to redeem herself, after a severe bashing from the critics about her performance in Gigli, with some strong acting and great battle scenes against another strong personality, Fonda.  Fonda is scarily convincing as the dysfunctional and highly strung mother-in-law.  Praise must also be given to Sykes who delivers some of the funniest lines in the film.  </P>\r\n\r\n<p>Monster-in-Law is a great comedy for all the family and some of the pranks played by J-Lo and Fonda are truly classic moments.  Watch this if you enjoyed Guess Who, Meet the Fockers or Meet the Parents.</P>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	164	2011-03-26
168	1	20	\N	Ong-Bak	<p>After the slowly growing trend to use more and more elaborate computer generated effects and wire fighting, the martial arts movies from the East have passed beyond farcical in recent years and some fear they are actually ruining their own credibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Against this trend a relatively low budget unknown movie from Thailand, Ong-Bak, has finally reached our shores. Telling the simple story of country boy, Ting (Tony Jaa) travelling into the big city to retrieve a sacred statue from vile gangsters, Ong-Bak is full of great fight sequences and some amazing stunts. The selling point being that the awesome stunts and gymnastics are actually real, no wires, no computer tinkering, simply real raw physical madness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tony Jaa stars as Ting, the idealistic and nave country boy who is trained in Muay Thai fighting by the village priest. Travelling into Bangkok to retrieve the head of a sacred statue stolen from his village, Ting has to defend himself against the gangsters who defend the mob. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help keep the mood light there is a comedy distraction in the form of petty crook George (Petchthai Womgkamlao), a person who looks very similar to one of Ting's fellow villagers who moved to the city. Noticing how much money he can make betting on Ting's fighting abilities, George tries to manipulate Ting to help him make money while innocent Ting searches for those who stole the statue. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The acting and the story are a little thin but that is easy to overlook while watching the many fight sequences. Tony Jaa could easily become the next Jet Li or Jackie Chan, his fresh face and, as expected, muscular form make him a great action star who, with great stunts, carries this film all alone. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Go watch this film if you enjoy Jackie Chan, Jet Li or Bruce Lee movies and the recent House of Flying Daggers and Hero.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	168	2011-03-26
172	1	20	\N	Kung Fu Hustle	<p>Due to the actions of a petty con artist, Sing (Stephen Chow - Shaolin Soccer), a small community of poor but peaceful people comes under attack from a ruthless axe-wielding mob. Luckily, among the humble community, three Kung Fu masters have been living in anonymity. Pushed too far by the gangsters, the masters confront their attackers and set in motion a madcap kung fu farce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heavily outnumbered, the three Kung Fu masters cannot hope to hold out for long against the resourceful and relentless axe gang and, as they face defeat, the community must hope for a miracle. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile the blundering con artist who triggered the conflict is still having difficulty gaining recognition from the mob or entry into the axe gang. Sing's bullied childhood taught him that good guys finish last and so he hopes to be a bad guy, but he is such a failure as a bad guy that he is left in broody limbo until fate finally intervenes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This film is crammed with far-fetched but hilarious kung fu fight sequences and pop culture references. The story is simple and provides a nice skeleton to support the madcap action and cheesy special effects. Look out for references to Spider-man, The Untouchables, The Shining, Kill Bill, Matrix Reloaded, Forrest Gump and Godzilla, among many others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sadly the cheesiness and the sheer absurdity of this movie, although appealing, make it a bit too silly for some. I really liked this film and laughed along at its stupidity but as this is not the first spoof of the kung-fu genre it was often predictable and offered nothing fresh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you enjoy Jackie Chan comedy flicks such as Shanghai Nights and Rush Hour or the recent release, Shaolin Soccer, you should find this entertaining.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	172	2011-03-26
176	1	16	\N	A Lot Like Love	<p>You know the drill - girl splits up with boy, girl meets new boy, girl and new boy have quick fling, both go their separate ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot like love is a film about a chance meeting with a complete stranger and tells the story of how the two characters' lives continue to entwine six years after their first meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the start of the film, Oliver (Ashton Kutcher - Guess Who) is an aspiring young entrepreneur who has set himself an ambition to have a successful career, a plush house and a loving wife in six years time.  Emily (Amanda Peet - Melinda and Melinda) is the complete opposite.  She is a free-spirited rock chick who doesn't seem to have a care in the world or any plans for the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coming from completely different worlds and after their chance meeting, the two depart.  Emily leaves with Oliver's phone number, as part of a bet, and the two go on to lead separate lives from then on.  Or so they thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three years later, we see Oliver and Emily have changed dramatically.  Emily is a more together and upmarket girl with hopes of becoming a successful actress and Oliver is no longer a floppy-haired mummy's boy but a hard working businessman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emily and Oliver soon cross paths again when Emily finds herself dateless for New Year after being dumped.  So it's Oliver to the rescue and the initial spark between the two is rekindled for the second time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with any love story, the years go by and the pair of lovebirds never seem to get their act together as new partners, work commitments and the long distance get in the way.  A lot like love shows you that love is sometimes not as straightforward as we would like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kutcher and Peet are cast well as the hapless couple, although I had expected more comedy content from Kutcher's character.  Probably a mistaken presumption on my part since Kutcher is usually typecast in funny roles (except the far from funny 'Butterfly Effect).</p>  \r\n\r\n<p>Peet was good as the pretty love interest but did not deliver anything new or exciting.  A mention must be given to Kal Penn (Harold and Kumar get the Munchies) who crops up as Oliver's wacky business sidekick, Jeeter, to add some much needed light relief against a "doomed relationship" backdrop.</p>  \r\n\r\n<p>A lot like love is a "nice" film but don't expect anything that you haven't already seen in all the romantic movies that have preceded it.  Watch it if you liked Closer or Serendipity, I know they are chalk and cheese but A Lot Like Love is about half way between the two.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	176	2011-03-26
181	1	3	\N	The Perfect Catch	<p>The Perfect Catch is the latest offering from the Farrelly brothers. The film charts the story of a love triangle that's not quite big enough to fit Ben (Jimmy Fallon - Taxi), Lindsey (Drew Barrymore - 50 First Dates) and an entire 25-man strong baseball team (the Boston Red Sox). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taken from Nick Hornby's "Fever Pitch", American screenwriting duo Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel don't just manage to swap football for baseball in this romantic comedy, they also manage to exchange most of the original film's satire and charm for a much more glossy, laugh by numbers approach. We obviously don't need to point out that this film is inevitably much more suited for an American audience, although certain slapstick moments will find fans among those who liked other Farrelly brother films such as "Shallow Hal (2001)".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drew Barrymore (who incidentally produced this film) is excellent as the career-driven workaholic, but Saturday Night Live resident Jimmy Fallon doesn't quite have enough charisma for the leading role.  Although Fallon is very loveable as the sensitive school teacher with the small income and a childlike devotion to the Boston Red Sox, he never really shines in the role, which in his defence is not helped by the script.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Perfect Catch isn't a bad film. It certainly has its moments and it's fine for a second date or a bit of light entertainment after work on an "Orange Wednesday". But essentially it doesn't have the charm of other romantic comedies in the genre. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to see a good Drew Barrymore film, go and see the "Wedding Singer", or "50 First Dates" both starring Adam Sandler and some excellent supporting characters. If you want to see a funny Farrelly brothers movie, go and see "Something about Mary" or "Dumb and Dumber". If you want to see a better romantic comedy about sports team obsession, go and watch the Fever Pitch (1997).</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	181	2011-03-26
251	1	20	\N	Rent	<p>This film would score at least a 4 out of 5 if an extra 10-15 minutes of script/film had been added. Co-written by James Marsh and Milo Addica (Monsters Ball, The King is striking and shocking. However, what it lacks is depth and background to the reasons behind Elvis Sandow's (Gael Garcia Bernal) actions. Though slight revelations to Elvis' background are made throughout the film these are non-revelatory and lack substance. Elvis' history is not painted early on and what results is a film that wanders from the sweet and sensual to the brutal and bloody, leaving the audience throughout with more questions than answers.\r\n</p><p>\r\nStrong, if not outstanding, performances are displayed throughout by the four lead characters: Elvis Sandow (Gael Garcia Bernal - Bad Education), Pastor David Sandow (William Hurt - A History of Violence), Malerie Sandow (Pell James - Uptown Girls) and Paul Sandow (Paul Dano - Taking Lives), it is a pity they are let down by the omissions within the script. Perhaps the strong influences of religion, the story of Cain and Abel and the theme of redemption play a part in this omission, what can't be forgotten however are the strong musical talents of Pell James and the twinkly eyes/bewitching smile of Gael Garcia Bernal. \r\n</p><p>\r\nUnless you are a budding actor, wait for the DVD release and with it a Director's Cut that hopefully will fill the gaps presented in its cinematic release.\r\n</p>	1	2011-03-26	251	2011-03-26
26	1	16	\N	Wimbledon	<p>If you need a reminder of what little summer we had here this year, then look no further. Wimbledon provides you with a glimmer of sunshine from one of the UK's largest sporting events of the summer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>British tennis player Peter Colt (Paul Bettany - Master and Commander), previously ranked 15th, or is it 11th, is trying to up his game before he retires from professional tennis to teach at an exclusive club.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>As an experienced player, Peter is feeling the strain as he competes against much younger opponents and fears being knocked out in the first round.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile at home his father Edward (Bernard Hill - LOTR) and mother Augusta (Eleanor Brom - The Heart of Me) are too busy squabbling to follow Peter's progress while his self serving brother Carl (James McAvory - Bright Young Things) bets against his own brother in the hope of making a big win.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peter's game takes a sudden good turn when he meets American hot shot Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst - Spider-Man 2). While Peter's game goes form strength to strength through love and attention, Lizzie's game starts to suffer and her father Dennis (Sam Neill - The Dish) does everything in his power to keep the two apart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the makers of Notting Hill, Wimbledon is a typical British romantic comedy filled with witty one-liners and English sensibilities but what sets it apart is the attention to the sport of tennis itself. As well as the well-trodden romance plot, Wimbledon can boast an insider glance at what it may feel like to be part of the world's greatest tennis grand slam.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Up and coming actor Paul Bettany provides a fresh take on what is usually Hugh Grant's territory as the English love interest and source of British humour. Praise must also go to Kirsten Dunst for her portrayal of a bitchy stuck up rich kid, something she does very well as witnessed in her previous role as Betty in Mona Lisa Smile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have an obsessive eye for detail you may notice an absence of Sue Barker, a lady who my boyfriend assures me is the personification of Wimbledon. Also among minor discrepancies are the absences of strawberries and cream and a semi final being played on minor court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trivialities aside, if you enjoy a bit of excitement and tension on the tennis court and a healthy romantic comedy, then go watch this film, especially for the scene on the Wimbledon showdown between the hero, Peter, and a young upstart played by Jake Hammond (The Day After Tomorrow). Go watch it if you enjoyed Notting Hill or Love Actually.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	26	2011-03-26

David suspects people in the town and grows anxious about the identity of the elusive Charlie. </P>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the light hearted family comedy Meet the Fockers, Robert DeNiro has returned once again to the dark an unsettling world of the thriller. As can be expected, DeNiro puts in an admirable effort if not career highlight. Dakota Fanning is also very convincing as a child trying deal with the dark realities of life. To the films merit, these two actors work well off of each other and there is a definite chemistry, as in lack of it, that adds credibility to the story. </P>\r\n\r\n<p>In support Famke Janssen (X-Men 2) pops up now and then as David's friend and protg Katherine but has barely enough screen time to make any impression while Elisabeth Shue (Hollow Man) makes a good impression as friendly and trusting Elizabeth, a potential romantic diversion for David. </P>\r\n\r\n<p>Director John Polson has made a good attempt at a suspense thriller but like his earlier movie "Swimfan", you may feel like you have seen this film before. There are some comparisons that could be made at this point but needles to say you may see where this story is going even if they do throw in a fair few red herrings. </P> \r\n\r\n<p>The first hour is quite slow and does little to build suspense. As the tension finally starts to set in, the pieces of the puzzle start to come together possibly a little too quick so very swiftly you are at the crisis of a very short third act. </P>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all, good acting and a solid concept but possibly lacking enough originality to linger in the audiences mind. If you enjoy horror/thrillers but have had little to look at for a while, Hide and Seek should provide you a good fix to tide you over until the release of Boogeyman or The Ring 2.</P> \r\n	2	2011-03-26	31	2011-03-26
32	1	16	Blah	Welcome To The Jungle	<p>The Rock (Dwayne Douglas Johnson - The Scorpion King) plays bounty hunter Beck who is sent on a mission to the Amazon jungle by mob boss Billy Walker (William Lucking - Red Dragon) to retrieve his delinquent son Travis (Seann William Scott - American Pie).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beck vows that this will be his last assignment to earn him enough money to pursue his dream of becoming a restaurant manager.  Beck does not like to fail and he is determined to bring Travis back from the jungle, no matter what.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Travis has other ideas.  He is on his own mission to find a priceless treasure known as the Gato and he has no plans to leave until he does.  But first he has to convince his girlfriend Mariana (Rosario Dawson - 25th Hour) to help him organise a mode of transport.  Unbeknown to Travis, Mariana has her own motives for joining him on the search for the treasure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with every adventure, there are always plenty of obstacles standing in the way of success.  In this case, it is slave driver and local baddie Hatcher (Christopher Walken - Catch Me If You Can) blocking the hero's exit out of the jungle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Rock surprisingly puts in a great performance as muscle-bound hard man Beck in his first major film role since The Scorpion King while Seann William Scott is hilarious in his usual cheeky chappy role.</p>  \r\n\r\n<p>Welcome to the Jungle was not really a favourite of mine but it did make me chuckle here and there.  It would probably appeal to fans of adventure films such as Indiana Jones but those looking for a tad more comedy.</p>  \r\n	2	2011-03-26	32	2012-03-08

33	1	12	Best blind samurai film with dancing ever	Zatoichi	<p>2004 has seen a resurgence in the genre of samurai films, with the releases of "The Last Samurai", the Oscar-nominated "The Twilight Samurai", and "Zatoichi" in UK screens. All three share the same setting, that of feudal Japan, but each one is very different to its companions. Takeshi Kitano's "Zatoichi" falls somewhere in between "The Last Samurai" and "The Twilight Samurai", with its mix of slow drama, slapstick-comedy and brutal violence. It sounds like a bizarre combination but it works perfectly. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Posing as an itinerant masseur, Zatoichi ('Beat' Takeshi - Battle Royale) meets an old peasant woman whose town is beset by two rival gangs vying for control. To repay her for her shelter and food he decides to rid the town of its gangsters and, in the process of doing so, he crosses paths with several other wanderers who have converged at the same place, including the masterless warrior Hattori whose skills might be a match for his own. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Writer/director/actor Takeshi Kitano is probably Japan's best known (living) director, and has gained widespread acclaim for his violent Yakuza films as well as his forays into drama, such as the beautiful "Dolls". Retaining only the bare essentials of a character with twenty five previous cinema outings to his name, Kitano pursued his own vision for "Zatoichi", aiming to introduce a dynamic rhythm to the slow feel of its predecessors. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This rhythm makes itself felt in a literal sense by the integration of background sounds, such as peasants tilling their fields, into the film's soundtrack, as well as in the slow build-up of tension, punctuated by flurries of slapstick comedy and sudden, explosive violence. The opening sequence is probably the best example of how these elements are fused together within the film, and is worth the price of admission alone. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kitano portrays Zatoichi in the same way as all his acting roles, but here his laconic minimalism is ideally suited to the deceptively harmless masseur, able to move from shuffling old blind man to master swordsman and back again with ease. He is ably supported by the hapless gambler Shinkichi, the old peasant woman, and the two vengeful geisha women, but a special mention should be made of Tadanobu Asano, who excels in his role as the deadly Hattori. Though he is impassive throughout most of the film, he manages to convey a range of emotion unmatched by any of his co-stars. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flashbacks are used throughout the film's duration, and the degree to which they add to the film varies. Some are seamlessly integrated into the thread of the story whereas others are obtrusive. Highlights include when Zatoichi passes by a rest-stop on the way to the village and a brief series of vignettes detailing the primary characters is shown as the camera passes over each one. Later on, Zatoichi and his companions take shelter during a thunderstorm, and the rain brings to mind different memories for each person. These moments enrich the film, even if they are not strictly necessary to elucidate an understanding of the characters and their motivations. The scene where one of the geisha girls practices her dancing and the camera switches between the geisha performing the dance as an adult and as a child is wonderful to behold. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only negative aspects about the film are that it is a little too long at 111 minutes, and the use of computer-generated blood is very unrealistic. Running length is always one of those subjective issues, and oddly enough I find that my opinion changes with every viewing. The latter qualm can be mitigated by the fact that it was a deliberate choice. Kitano exaggerated the spurting effect in order to tone down the violence, and one does get used to it after a while. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>From Kitano's platinum blonde hair to the meticulous sets and costumes, and the rousing Stomp-esque dance finale, "Zatoichi" is a film blending new and old, a re-imagination that injects a shot of adrenaline into a tired and lacklustre genre and a truly entertaining film that deserves to be seen by a wider audience.</p>	4	2011-03-26	33	2012-03-08
16	1	20	\N	The Day After Tomorrow	<p>Here in good ole blighty we are used to the odd spate of furious unpredictable weather, even if our rail network isn't. However in the US, and especially in the near perpetually sunny LA, they generally seem to know what the weather is going to be like at least for the next few days. It is understandable then that an LA meteorologist may be forgiven for making out on the sofa in the back office expecting the smog and sunshine to dance as usual outside his lofty window. Wrong! For on this particular day the same meteorologist will see his city sucked off the planet by a series of freak tornadoes quicker than he can pull up his pants. This is one of the early and powerful scenes that help grab the imagination in the latest big budget disaster flick, The Day After Tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid - The Rookie) is a world leading paleo-climatologist studying ice core samples that may hold the secret to the world's past ice ages. Meanwhile in Scotland, Professor Terry Rapson (Ian Holm - Fifth Element) is noticing a curious sudden drop in ocean temperature and a diminishing number of digestive biscuits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All around the world the weather is going insane. Hail stones like cricket balls knocking people unconscious in Japan and tornadoes in Los Angeles. It doesn't take long for the two scientists and their teams to do the math and realise the world is in trouble. A climatic shift and a new ice age is just around the corner. As the big freeze starts to take hold, the emotional core of the film comes to the fore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Dr Hall has been trying to convince the politicians that the world is in trouble, his son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal - Donnie Darko) has become trapped in New York by the rapidly worsening weather. Dr Hall has grown distant from his son, and now that he may lose Sam forever he realises that this may be his last chance to make amends, and so he sets out to cross the snowy wasteland that was Washington and Philadelphia to find Sam and save him. If only he can get there in time. Meanwhile in New York, Sam and his friends fight to survive as the water rises, the temperature falls and the world that they once knew slowly falls apart around them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Day after Tomorrow is the latest big budget special effects disaster movie from director Roland Emmerich, one of the two minds behind 1996's awesome Independence Day and 1998's adequate Godzilla remake. Unlike those earlier disaster flicks in which America saves the world from aliens and mutated lizards, The Day After Tomorrow is less of a 'fuzzy' movie, darker and more realistic. A film where politicians do have flaws and sometimes the right decision does not exist and the happy ending may not be possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gradual build up of increasingly bad weather and the realisation that something is seriously wrong has been handled brilliantly. Act one of the classic three part structure has set up what could be a great disaster movie. The effects are possibly the best I have seen for a movie of this genre and therein may hold the key to some of the film's weaknesses. After such a tremendous first act, the movie has difficulty keeping the attention and pace through the remainder of the film although not through any lack of effort on the part of the actors involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dennis Quaid is an underrated actor and in this film he gives a good popcorn performance as the scientist cursed with the knowledge of what the world is facing while battling to reach his son. Similarly Jake Gyllenhaal will add to his growing fan base as the brainy kid who finds the courage and the tenacity to survive when others may give up and still get the girl. In support Ian Holm gives a strong performance as a remote and tired scientist who knows the danger of his situation and provides one of the most memorable and emotive lines of the film. Also young Emmy Rossum (Mystic River) adds an element of romance as the love interest to Sam, a good performance from someone relatively new to the big screen.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The Day After Tomorrow is definitely a film of two halves. One great filled with effects and tension, the other slow, thin and hardly saved even by an attack of rabid wolves on an oil tanker adrift on Manhattan's 5th Avenue (that's how thin it is). The great build up followed by the lengthy family struggle leaves the film starved in the second half and so as people leave the film the earlier brilliance is already tarnished. This film is good to see once, if only for the special effects, but a second viewing proves tiresome.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	16	2011-03-26
17	1	20	\N	The Ladykillers	<p>Before I postulate as eloquently as permissible on the merits of the latest film from the Coen brothers, I feel it best form to credit the original 1955 Ealing comedy of the same name. That earlier comedic masterpiece starred the legendary Alec Guinness and the comedic genius Peter Sellers. Possibly one of the finest of the Ealing comedies, it is now a cult masterpiece and worthy of appreciation. It is possibly that brilliance that inspired the Coen's (Fargo, The Big Lebowski) to attempt a contemporary remake.</p>  \r\n\r\n<p>The story follows a group of individually talented criminals, lead by the eccentric Professor G H Dorr, in their attempt to rob a Mississippi casino. The robbery requires the criminals to tunnel into the seemingly secure subterranean vault from the cellar of a nearby house inhabited by a lone church-going old lady.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>On the premise that they are an eclectic group of musicians, the criminals set to work in the basement. However the robbery may prove to be easier thaN the concealment of their plan as the little old dear upstairs, Marva Munson (Irma P Hall - Patch Adams), slowly deduces what is really going on. Which of the criminal band can finally silence the innocent good woman before their plans are revealed? Will it be the explosives expert with an acute case of irritable bowel syndrome (J K Simmons - Spider-Man), the silent and ruthless tunnelling expert known as the general (Tzi Ma - The Quiet American), the gangster with attitude (Marlon Wayans - Scary  Movie), the ignorant brute (Ryan Hurst - We Were Soldiers) or the charismatic and elaborate mastermind behind the whole endeavour, Professor G H Dorr (Tom Hanks - Forrest Gump).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Coen Brothers have returned to form with a fine script laced with subtle reference, imagination and wit. As with the Coen's earlier films, it is difficult to compare this movie with either their comedies such as the Big Lebowski or their sly look at criminal misadventure, Fargo. The Ladykillers is significantly different from the original to allow it to stand alone from its cult predecessor. However, the reasons that this movie deserves merit are the same reasons that may deter the popcorn crowd. The script has many subtle literary references that may pass over the head of the casual observer as may the delicate sarcasm and unique style of the movie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tom Hanks provides a fresh and entertaining revamp of the clich eccentric academic and manages to add to an impressive past catalogue of performances, another role that proves his ability as both a comedian and an actor. Also worth particular attention is Irma P Hall as the strong willed, observant and unforgiving old lady who foils the plot and provides a great deal of the comedy. It is the relationship between these two well developed characters, the fragile and honest but simple church lady and the criminal genius, that provides the real entertainment in this film.</p>  \r\n\r\n<p>Overall I feel that The Ladykillers is a truly great film but the complexity of the dialogue may detract from its enjoyment by the younger audience. Similarly the reliance on verbal humour over physical humour can leave some significant stretches of the film without any real focus therefore losing some of the audience. I would recommend this film to fans of The Big Lebowski, Sleuth and Oh Brother Where Art Thou.</p>  \r\n	3	2011-03-26	17	2011-03-26
18	1	16	\N	The Prince & Me	<p>Edward, the crown Prince of Denmark (Luke Mably - 28 Days Later), is struggling to meet his parent's expectations as heir to the throne. The King (James Fox - Sexy Beast) and Queen (Miranda Richardson - Sleepy Hollow) believe that Edward has become too accustomed to a lavish lifestyle rather than fulfilling his royal duties as prince.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Much to his parent's surprise, Edward decides to take a break from his royal lifestyle and follow an independent life in America. Accompanied by his faithful and cynical manservant Soren (Ben Miller - Johnny English), they set off to university life in Wisconsin.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>It doesn't take long for the new laid back student 'Eddie' to meet the polar control freak student Paige (Julia Stiles - Mona Lisa Smile) however the pair don't hit it off thanks to Eddie's misinterpreted Danish humour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a quirk of fate, Eddie is paired with Paige as lab partner, their grades dependant on their ability to work together. As Eddie realises he has no money left and seeks employment, Paige struggles to keep her grades up in order to get into medical school, a problem not assisted by Eddie's blas attitude towards his studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After this shaky start the couple start to spend more and more time together and eventually Eddie manages to melt Paige's ice queen exterior unaware that he himself is maturing in the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The couple are from completely different worlds but Paige remains blissfully unaware of Eddie's regal status. When Eddie is snatched back to Denmark to nurse his ailing father, Paige is faced with a huge dilemma. Should she drop everything and follow Eddie to Denmark or should she stay in the United States and follow her dreams of becoming a doctor?</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Julia Stiles is type cast once again as a witty intelligent girl in a sloppy love story. Despite this she continues to deliver a good performance as a struggling student while Luke Mably puts in a more defining act as the handsome prince charming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Prince and Me follows the traditional love story of rags to riches such as in 'Pretty Woman' and 'Sweet Home Alabama'. An emotional and entertaining movie I highly recommend.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	18	2011-03-26
14	1	20	\N	The Bourne Supremacy	<p>In 2002 cinema audiences were treated to The Bourne Identity, an excellent thriller that rejuvenated the flagging espionage movie genre. Based on the Robert Ludlum classic, Matt Damon (Ocean's 11) starred as Jason Bourne, a man surrounded by mystery found floating in the Mediterranean with two bullet wounds and no memory. Now, after a two year rest, the second book in the Ludlum trilogy, The Bourne Supremacy, hits the big screen. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bourne Identity followed the story of Jason as he recovers from his wounds and tries to find his identity while being pursued by various unknown agents intent on killing him. Jason's only ally through those trials was a free spirited girl called Marie. A lonely girl drifting through Europe, also looking for a purpose, who was innocently drawn into the adventure. At the end of the Bourne Identity, Jason confronts his former employers and gives them an uneasy truce, then vanishes into Europe to try and forge a normal life with Marie. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two years have passed and now its time for a new adventure. In Berlin, a high profile CIA exchange is ambushed by an unknown assailant who has stolen Bourne's identity to place blame on his broad shoulders. Meanwhile in India, Marie and Jason continue their efforts to piece together the scattered fragments of Jason's memory. However this idyllic retreat will soon be shattered by the arrival of a shadow from Jason's past. With his cover blown, Jason must return to Europe to unravel the mystery in Berlin, find his new adversary and clear his name. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bourne Supremacy is a direct follow on from the Bourne Identity. Luckily all of the surviving primary cast have returned to maintain consistency and director Paul Greengrass (Bloody Sunday [TV]) has used a very similar filming style to make this movie a continuation rather than a sequel. Using hand held camerawork, everyday settings and plausible action sequences, Greengrass has succeeded in making a gritty visceral thriller that stands apart from other excessive action movies. Indeed this movie may be the one to put Greengrass, a relative newcomer, on the map. </p>\r\n\r\nMatt Damon as Jason Bourne successfully combines a sense of cool confidence and ruthless determination mixed with a hint of personal fragility and loss. In support, Julie Stiles (The Prince & Me) returns for a minor cameo as Nicky, only a small part but emotive holding some secrets to the dark past of Bourne. Similarly, Brian Cox (Troy) returns in good form as blustery CIA executive Ward Abbot, a character from the original movie pulling some strings back at the office while Bourne causes mayhem. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>New to the cast and worthy of mention is Joan Allen (The Notebook) as Pamela Landy, the CIA task leader chasing both Bourne and a CIA traitor hidden within the organisation. Following the role of King Eomer in Lord of the Rings, Karl Urban turns in a cold vicious performance as Killick, a rival assassin and general evil-doer. Similarly fellow LOTR alumni, Marton Csokas, although only in the film for a few minutes, gets to partake in the films best one on one fight sequences as Jarda, a former colleague of Bourne who does not take too well to unexpected visitors. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both the Bourne Identity and now, The Bourne Supremacy, are great edge of your seat thrillers. The story remains engaging and intelligent, keeping you thinking while the plot moves from one direction to another. Unlike many contemporaries these twists and turns are allowed to unfold on screen naturally without being spoon fed to the audience. The relatively complex story is not laid on a plate or explained verbatim and this adds further realism to the movie. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of this plot and dialogue may have become tiring, yet it has been carefully broken up and balanced nicely with some truly impressive action sequences. In one scene there is a violent confrontation between a handcuffed assassin wielding a knife and a reluctant killer armed merely with a rolled up magazine, a scene as tense as a violin string. Similar to its predecessor, this movie also boasts a lengthy and incredibly realistic car chase that will have you biting your nails. It would not be an exaggeration to say that this is one of the best car chases since Ronin's fabled Paris chase sequence. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>While reflecting on this film and writing this review I am eager to watch this film again. If you are a fan of The French Connection, The Ipcress File, Ronin or The Marathon Man, I think you will really love this movie. At the same time, if you like great action sequences and car chases, this movie is an absolute must. As mentioned earlier, this is an adaptation of the second book in a Robert Ludlum trilogy, they must make a third and I can't wait to see it.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	16	2011-03-26
20	1	20	\N	The Stepford Wives	<p>As a high flying successful television promoter, Joanna Eberhard (Nicole Kidman - Cold Mountain) is keenly aware of the subtle battle between the sexes. She designs and promotes TV shows allowing women to get even with the men who they feel have treated them wrong. After a minor mishap at a major publicity event, Joanna is fired and promptly suffers a mental collapse. Her career, her life, is over, what is she to do?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Devoted and loving husband Walter (Matthew Broderick - Election) is advised to give Joanna time to relax and find herself and so with this in mind they decide to pack up their belongings and move the family to the tranquil secluded town of Stepford nestled in the forests of Connecticut.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Stepford is the image of perfection and as husband Walter is surprised and impressed at the beauty of the town and its women, wife Joanna feels uncomfortable and suspicious of the oh-so-sweet surroundings. Luckily she soon finds some comfort in the similarly unsettled New York writer Bobbie Markowitz (Bette Midler - Get Shorty) and camp Roger (Roger Bart - The Insider).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As their husbands become more and more at home in the gentleman's club that seems to dominate the town, the three cynics start delving into the lives of their new neighbours and it doesn't take too long before they find something truly strange is going on. The women of Stepford, are...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Stepford Wives is a reworking of the 1975 comedy of the same name. The setting has been updated, as has the technology behind the beauty. The town is picturesque and all the clothes, settings and scenery are tuned to be perfect. Similarly the Stepford women all look stunning in their summer dresses and high heels as they swan around the town.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the lead role as inquisitive Joanna, Nicole Kidman lightens her CV with comedy following her recent run of dark gritty movies and is enjoyable as the stressed out confused control freak stuck inside a hallmark card. Similarly Matthew Broderick is good as the devoted yet put upon husband seduced by the secrets of Stepford. In support Bette Midler delivers some of the funniest one off lines in the movie as the loud confrontational writer fighting the chintz at every turn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite good performances from the cast, this film has some problems. As a comedy the laughs seem few and far between while the idea behind the movie had potential for so much more. It felt like the film spent too long getting going and yet never really seemed to get anywhere after all the effort. The finale is indeed comical but cannot make up for the slow early stages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In June this year we were treated to a revamped version of 'The Ladykillers' and similar to that movie 'The Stepford Wives' has a great sense of style that gives the film an artistic quality to the credit of director Frank Oz (The Score) and his team. However The Stepford Wives seems to lack the snappy intelligent script that raised The Ladykillers above a two star rating and, although entertaining, does not really exceed expectation.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed the Truman Show, The Ladykillers or to any fan of Nicole Kidman and Matthew Broderick. Men, treat your women with care and respect and they may love you. Women, treat your man likewise or he may convert you into a robot!</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	20	2011-03-26
21	1	16	\N	The Terminal	<p>Loosely based on a true story, The Terminal follows the adventures and trials of one man's prolonged mission to keep a family promise while confined by legal restrictions and red tape. <p>Inspired by true events, Open Water is a chilling tale of the most horrific holiday disaster you can imagine. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks - The Ladykillers) is on his way to New York. However unbeknown to him, while in the air Viktor's homeland is plunged into civil war and anarchy following a military coup. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Viktor arrives at JFK airport he is greeted by an anal-retentive immigration official Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci - The Core) who tries to explain that the coup within Viktor's home country has rendered his passport and visa void and unacceptable. Although Viktor's English is very limited he soon realises that he cannot return home as it technically no longer exists, yet he cannot enter the US without breaking the law and being incarcerated. With nowhere he can go Viktor is forced to make himself at home in the terminal building. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Essentially a character piece and a subtle comedy, The Terminal follows Viktor as he forms a new life within the airport with all the challenges that brings. Where will he sleep? How can he get money to buy food? How can he move on and finally visit New York? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>During his time confined in the terminal, Viktor manages to find work, befriend various interesting airport staff, play cupid and even start his own romance with air stewardess Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones - Chicago). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following on from 2002's successful Catch Me If You Can, Tom Hanks once again reunites with Spielberg and grabs another striking lead role. Hanks' portrayal of Viktor is truly entertaining and possibly one his best comedic performances since Forrest Gump. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In support Catherine Zeta-Jones is delightful as the unlucky in love air hostess Amelia providing a performance that gives a much-needed boost for her acting career. Zeta-Jones is beautiful and seems to glow in this movie adding a great romance element to the proceedings, yet also providing a little humour of her own. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Set against these two lovable characters, Stanley Tucci is wonderfully horrible as the career hungry airport executive Frank, determined to wash his hands of Viktor's problem so he may continue his quest for dominance. Essentially the bad guy, Tucci fills the role with nervous energy and snide comments to make Frank an oily persona and worthy of every boo-hiss. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This latest movie from Steven Spielberg (Catch Me If You Can) is a gentle and mesmerising tale filled with good humour, honest emotion and a fair amount of slapstick. The scale of the set and attention to detail give the film credibility and the keen camera work and subtle direction we have come to expect from the great director are all apparent from the opening shots. This movie is yet another Oscar contender from Spielberg and stands apart from his other comedies. </p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	21	2011-03-26
22	1	20	\N	The Village	<p>There are things living in the woods. People do not speak of it but they know that the things are there. If you do not go into the woods you will be safe. If you do not display the forbidden colour, you will be safe. They are there in the woods looking at you as you busy yourself in the Village but if you leave them alone, they will leave you alone. For years there has been a peaceful truce between the people of the Village and the things in the forest. That peace is about to be tested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1999 the young little known director M Night Shyamalan wrote, produced and directed The Sixth Sense. The story of a young boy who is haunted by ghosts who have some purpose in their visits that he cannot understand. The film was an instant success and tapped into a genre that was in much need of revival, the chiller. After making the sleeper hit Unbreakable, Shyamalan scared audiences once again with Signs, the story of a simple family whose faith is tested by world changing events beyond their control.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>It is difficult to discuss the story of any of Shyamalan's films without giving away some important part of the story. The opening paragraph of this review is all I dare say without ruining the surprise for anyone reading this that has yet to see the film. Needless to say, it's another great movie from Shyamalan. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In both the Sixth Sense and Signs, Shyamalan showed audiences that you do not need great special effects or gory murders to make a great scary movie. The slow building tension, the unseen horror just behind the door, the knowledge that something will happen but that you don't know what. These are things that can make a great psychological horror. The unknown allows your imagination to run wild and in essence you create your own horror as you watch the events on screen. The Village uses these same tricks to bring you once again to the edge of your seat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Signs alumni Joaquin Phoenix (Gladiator) returns to the screen as quiet and mysterious Lucius Hunt alongside young new starlet Bryce Dallas Howard who steals the show as Ivy Walker, a blind girl with no fear. Her performance is exceptional and I would not be surprised if she doesn't win a few awards when the ceremonies begin. Also special mention must be made for Adrien Brody (The Pianist) who gives a good performance as Noah, a simple young man who does not see the danger surrounding the others.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The friendship between the fearless Ivy, the worriless simple Noah and the observant but fearful Lucius, allow three different perspectives, and thanks to the high level of acting this allows each character to connect with the audience and add realism to the film drawing the viewer into the story.</p>  \r\n\r\n<p>In support, Sigourney Weaver (Heartbreakers), William Hurt (A.I.), Brendan Gleeson (Troy) and another Signs alumni Cheery Jones, are all on top form as the suspicious and fearful village elders who dare not break the peace with the things in the forest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The excellent acting and the clever direction allow for another great movie. However I feel that unlike Signs or The Sixth Sense, The Village takes a little while to get going and this may affect the enjoyment of the movie by some of the more restless among us. Personally I found this a great film and if you enjoyed any of the earlier Shyamalan movies I think you'll enjoy The Village.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	22	2011-03-26
23	1	20	\N	Thunderbirds	<p><img src="graphics/kids.gif" align="right">In a world full of technology and advancement, mistakes will happen, accidents will occur and lives will hang in the balance. Who will rescue those lives when all goes pear shaped and it seems there is no chance of escape? </P>\r\n\r\n<p>5, An orbiting space station, 4, a yellow submarine, 3 A giant red rocket, 2 A huge green cargo aircraft, 1, A shining silver rocket plane...Thunderbirds are go! </P> \r\n\r\n<p>On a remote tropical island, billionaire Jeff Tracy (Bill Paxton) has built a secret base and is the head of International Rescue. Each of his eldest sons is pilot to one of the unique rescue vehicles known as the Thunderbirds. </P>\r\n\r\n<p>While each of these illustrious pilots enjoys the excitement and adventure of life as an international hero, the youngest son, Alan (Brady Corbet - Thirteen), must content himself with high school studies and obscurity. </P>\r\n\r\n<p>As Alan prepares to go home for spring break, International Rescue attends an oilrig fire saving the lives of the roughnecks and extinguishing the flames with mere seconds to spare. However family friend, aristocrat and under cover agent, Lady Penelope (Sophia Myles - Underworld) has doubts about the cause of the fire and as she returns Alan home to Tracy Island we get the first hint that trouble is on the horizon. </P>\r\n\r\n<p>After a direct attack on the Tracy's orbiting space station, father and numerous sons fly off in Thunderbird 3 leaving the island base relatively unprotected. Offshore, beneath the waves in a heavily armed submarine the mysterious villain known as The Hood (Ben Kinglsey - The House of Sand and Fog), commences his attack on the island. </P> \r\n\r\n<p>With little resistance the Hood gains control of International Rescue and maroons the heroes in their failing space station so that he may set about using the rest of the thunderbird's impressive technology to rob the largest banks of the world. Luckily young Alan has evaded capture and now the young wannabe Thunderbird and his friends must work as a team if they are to save their families and thwart the evil plans of The Hood. </P>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent years we have seen one after the other of big screen adaptations of classic TV shows cashing in on the show's name while making movies dissimilar albeit themed on the original idea. In this instance I feel the movie remains quite honest to the theme and style of the original. True, there are no strings in this movie as in the Gerry Anderson TV series and Lady Penelope now drives a Ford rather than a Rolls but these differences are only bugbears for the avid fans. </P>  \r\n\r\n<p>This film is designed for children and as a big kid I really liked it and feel that some of the negative press I've seen has been a little unfair. The audience in my local cinema seemed entertained and the kids who normally run around or talk throughout films (as in spider-man 2), were quietly captivated by the events on screen. </P>\r\n\r\n<p>The rockets, the house and the gadgets are all present and correct with only very minor alteration and the special effects make these vehicles and their scale seem credible. The story has sufficient complexity to fill the time without losing the audience (children) and the mix of humour, morality and adventure make for an entertaining popcorn movie. Think Spy Kids crossed with Apollo 13. </P>\r\n\r\n<p>Sophia Myles is delicious as Lady Penelope mixing style and confidence with a dash of sharp wit. Similarly Ron Cook (24 Hour Party People) was good fun as the ever faithful chauffer, butler and dogs body, Parker. Brady Corbet in the lead role of Alan Tracy was better than expected for someone of just 16 years of age whereas someone may have forgotten to tell Bill Paxton that this was a like action adaptation, his wooden performance thankfully banished to space for the majority of the film. Luckily however, and as usual, the baddie is always the most charismatic and like any good American movie they rolled out the English actor to fill the shoes of the pantomime villain. Ben Kingsley is nicely evil with a good amount of menace mixed with the necessary overconfident swagger and humour for the clich nemesis. </P>\r\n\r\n<p>I would recommend this film for all kids, young families and fans of the original show. It's a good length, not too long, and is full of stunning effects.</P>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	23	2011-03-26

24	1	20	\N	Troy	<p> </p>\r\n<p>Back in the days of antiquity the great Greek poet Homer wrote the epic poem, \r\nThe Iliad, following the key events of the historic Greek attack on the city of \r\nTroy and the fates of various characters central to that war. The main focus of \r\nthe story is Achilles, the great Greek warrior and his importance to the war and \r\nthe destiny that awaits him at Troy. I must confess that I have never read the \r\ngreat poem myself so shall instead review the thread of the film, Troy. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>While visiting Sparta (A kingdom of Greece) on a mission of peace with his \r\n  brother Hector, the young Trojan prince Paris seduces the wife of King Menelaus, \r\n  Helen, and takes her back to Troy so that they may fulfil their love. Following \r\n  their elopement, Menelaus is understandably enraged and asks his power hungry \r\n  elder brother Agamemnon, mightiest of Greek Kings, to help him recover his wife. \r\n  Agamemnon welcomes this opportunity as an excuse to further the expansion of \r\n  his empire and attack the kingdom of Troy and its famous city. To achieve this \r\n  aim Agamemnon summons all his armies including those of Ajax, Odysseus and of \r\n  course, Achilles. Meanwhile Hector, Paris and Helen arrive back at Troy where \r\n  proud king Priam awaits them. The war is set. A thousand ships approach the \r\n  coast and Hector prepares the Greek armies to withstand the attack. The story \r\n  continues through the battles, triumphs and failures of many a character, mainly \r\n  surrounding Achilles. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This movie is filled with fantastic special effects, costumes and sets; a very \r\n  lush production on an epic scale mandatory for such an epic poem. The production \r\n  team and art departments have taken time to develop a structure and scale to \r\n  allow the city of Troy, now mere rubble somewhere in Turkey, an authentic style \r\n  and therefore credibility. The costumes of the leading ladies in particular \r\n  and the decoration of the interior shots, so special to a big effects movie \r\n  these days, are rich and grand. The special effects expand on these real items \r\n  and add scale to the cityscape and especially to the thousand Greek ships and \r\n  the various battle sequences that dominate nearly half the film. The scenes \r\n  of fighting are quite visceral and reminiscent of Gladiator and the Lord of \r\n  the Rings trilogy with CGI allowing each soldier an identity, a role and quite \r\n  often a demise. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The central characters of the movie appear to be the uncontrollable warrior \r\n  Achilles (Brad Pitt - Ocean's 11), the two princes of Troy, Hector (Eric Bana \r\n  - The Hulk) and Paris (Orlando Bloom - LOTR), Helen, once of Sparta, now of \r\n  Troy (Diane Kruige) and the fighting kings, Agamemnon of Greece (Brian Cox - \r\n  Manhunter) and Priam of Troy (Peter O'Toole - Lawrence of Arabia). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film visits each character as often as it can allowing each only a sparse \r\n  amount of time to put across any depth of identity. Despite this constraint, \r\n  Eric Bana gives a strong performance of a good man caught in a sequence of events \r\n  beyond his control while balancing the role of a gentle loving father with that of \r\n  a courageous warrior. We get some sense of Hector's high sense of honour and \r\n  duty and also his devotion to family and country. Achilles, on the other hand, gets \r\n  more screen time than most and yet the script doesn't really allow us to understand \r\n  or feel for his character. Brad Pitt's acting is good but it is not his career \r\n  best. Then again when people look back at this movie they will probably be remembering \r\n  Mr Pitt for his fine physique and fighting rather than his tense dialogue. Peter \r\n  O'Toole, long absent from blockbuster success, gives a great performance as \r\n  the Trojan king Priam with an awesome sense of presence and strength of will \r\n  that out acts two to one the role of the power obsessed Greek King, Agamemnon. \r\n  Brian Cox's booming voice and commanding nature are all present and correct \r\n  but as with Mr Pitt, this again is not a career best. While discussing actors \r\n  I suppose we should discuss Orlando Bloom as he technically is an actor although \r\n  in this film he is lost among giants. Pretty boy looks and weak acting support \r\n  his role as a weak pretty boy. No real push then. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ladies of the movie, Helen (Diane Kruge), Andromache (Saffron Burrows - \r\n  Deep Blue Sea), wife of Hector and Briseis (Rose Byrne - I Capture The Castle),\r\n  cousin of Hector, are all beautiful and emotive watching all whom they love fight \r\n  a war where only a few can survive and none can be happy. Among the three, Rose \r\n  Byrne stands out as the virgin priestess imprisoned by Achilles. Of the female \r\n  roles, the role of Briseis was the most interesting and emotional and she even \r\n  gets one of the few funny lines in the film. She also manages to portray a character \r\n  both vulnerable and powerful as she is imprisoned by Achilles yet manages to \r\n  break through his cold killer facade and find the more gentle human hidden within. Indeed \r\n  you could argue that without the acting of Rose Byrne as Briseis, Brad Pitt's \r\n  portrayal of Achilles personality may collapsed. Then again as mentioned earlier, Mr Pitt was not assisted by a script that tries to alter the sense of Achilles without explanation. Early reference about seeking immortality seem to be washed aside after one night in a tent with Briseis. Something that makes Achilles appear whimsical rather than the iron willed greatest warrior of all time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So all in all the acting was good although some did not provide career bests. \r\n  As mentioned in the early stages of this rant, half the film is dominated by \r\n  effects and I'm happy to say that these compensate in full for any fault in \r\n  acting. The battle sequences are of a scale equal to LOTR's Return of the King \r\n  and do not disappoint. The fighting appears very real and there is good use \r\n  of photography to draw the viewer into the battles. In addition the set pieces \r\n  for Troy and the costumes of the characters show good attention to detail. All \r\n  these effects help capture the audience and add to the film. The themes of love \r\n  and honour mixed with a large dose of male nudity are sure to tempt more than \r\n  average female attendance to what is in essence a war film. For the lads, the \r\n  ladies are beautiful if not as naked as the men, and the fighting is intense \r\n  and gripping. All in all a great film and despite its length it keeps the action \r\n  up and attention fixed throughout. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This film has faults but it also has some high merits. It may not be an Oscar \r\n  contender and may be too reminiscent of Gladiator or Lord of the Rings to set \r\n  itself apart but all in all it's a good movie for the popcorn masses. As with \r\n  all literary adaptations there is the hope that those truly interested may pick \r\n  up the book and read the source material. I shall. Hopefully that is some small \r\n  consolation for the upset intellectuals. As a final parting word, this movie \r\n  requires the big screen. Home cinema technology has come a long way but this \r\n  film demands the biggest screen possible. Go and see it while you can. <br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n	2	2011-03-26	24	2011-03-26
25	1	20	\N	Walking Tall	<p>Earlier this year The Rock returned to the big screen in the comedy action film 'Welcome to the Jungle', a film that did not cause too much of a flurry of excitement at the box office but was entertaining nonetheless.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Now, as summer approaches The Rock will be on screen again in a new film that looks like it may make that less than thrilled box office of the spring pay more attention to a rising star.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Walking Tall is a contemporary remake of the 1974 movie of the same name focusing on the story of one man's personal mission to rid his hometown of corruption in his own way.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Returning home after a tour of duty, Chris Vaughn (The Rock - Welcome to the Jungle) looks forward to settling down and finding a nice steady existence. However, on his return he finds his hometown in a state of depression. The wood mill that once employed the populace has been closed and now the only distraction is a crooked casino owned and run by an old school acquaintance. After a fracas with the casino's security staff, Vaughn is beaten and left for dead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As he searches for justice Vaughn sees how far the virus of corruption has spread. With a corrupt police force making no effort to help and with no other avenue of justice left, Vaughn takes matters into his own hands and starts a crusade to save his town. In his self appointed quest he is assisted by old friend and wash out Ray (Johnny Knoxville - Grand Theft Parsons) and supported by old flame Deni (Ashley Scott - S.W.A.T).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This film, more than any of his previous roles, allows The Rock to demonstrate some degree of acting ability while continuing to kick arse and wield a lump of wood as a weapon of choice. This film may be the launch pad that will make Hollywood recognise a slowly emerging talent that may replace the absent big muscle action hero slot once held by the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger and hopeful contender Vin Diesel.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Johnny Knoxville gives a good performance as the comedy sidekick who joins the war fighting alongside the hero with his own style and lack of grace. Ashley Scott provides the female quota of good looks and somehow manages to shine despite hardly any dialogue. Also, on the darker side, Neal McDonough (Minority Report) is suitably sinister and sleek as the rich bad guy, plucking the strings of corruption to make the puppet sheriff dance and the children buy their drugs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all this is a good solid popcorn movie. The fight sequences are good and visceral and the story, although well trodden, is stable and well presented. The dramatic forest backdrop and the very real to life setting make this film a good all rounder and shows you don't need huge effects to draw an audience. I recommend this film to every action junky. A popcorn classic that may be the diamond in the rough or the sleeper hit among the summers giants.</p> \r\n	3	2011-03-26	25	2011-03-26
27	1	12	\N	Lost In Translation	<p>Ageing actor Bob Harris has travelled to Tokyo to film a series of \r\nlucrative commercials, but is perplexed by the absurdities of Japanese \r\nculture. He takes refuge in the hotel bar, and there he meets Charlotte, \r\na young woman who has come to Japan with her photographer husband. She \r\nis also adrift in the metropolis, and they form a friendship that slowly \r\nbecomes more intimate as time passes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The confident and assured direction of "Lost In Translation" makes it \r\nhard to believe that this is only Sofia Coppola's second film, following \r\non from her acclaimed debut "The Virgin Suicides". Reminiscent of Wong \r\nKar-Wai's <em>In The Mood For \r\nLove</em>, Lost In Translation is comprised of a series of beautifully \r\nstaged vignettes, revelling in the minutia of Bob and Charlotte's lives. \r\nIt is a film about nothing; the empty spaces in people's lives that are \r\ngradually filled up with moments of sitting alone at a bar listening to \r\njazz, feeling isolated in a crowd, or staring out on to an alien city. \r\nThis sense of hollowness is emphasised by the richly varied soundtrack, \r\none that is as dreamy as the film that it accompanies. It often takes \r\nprecedence over any background noise, and allows the viewer to empathise \r\nwith the moods of the characters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stranger side of Japanese culture is seen through Bob's eyes, and \r\nthough this verges on parody at times, it is tempered with Charlotte's \r\nvisits to temples and shrines, contrasting modern Japan with its more \r\nspiritual aspects. The film shows Japan to be a place of contradictions: \r\nbeautiful, strange and incredibly lonely all at the same time. It will \r\nresonate with anyone who has visited the land of the rising sun, and \r\nindeed anyone who has visited a country whose culture is vastly \r\ndifferent to that of their own.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The two leads, played by Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, are \r\noutstanding and their on-screen chemistry creates just the right level \r\nof sexual tension. Murray is playing it straight here, and his deadpan \r\nresponses to the situations he finds himself in are brilliantly \r\nobserved. Johansson also shines here as the neglected young wife, and \r\nwith each successive film she continues to demonstrate an impressive \r\nlevel of talent for such a young actress.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>"Lost In Translation" is not for everyone. Dialogue is sparse and the \r\nplot is so languidly executed that it becomes ethereal, but these should \r\nnot be viewed as flaws. This is a slow, melancholic film that is \r\nachingly beautiful to watch and one that comes highly recommended.</p> \r\n\r\n	4	2011-03-26	27	2011-03-26
29	1	16	\N	Honey	<p>Honey Daniels (Jessica Alba - Dark Angel) is a Hip Hop dance instructor in the Bronx who teaches the neighbourhood's kids how to move and groove in a bid to keep them off the streets and away from drugs and crime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While working as a barmaid at her local nightclub, Honey's amazing dance moves are caught on camera and passed on to a top music video producer Michael Ellis (David Moscow - Just Married).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Michael hires Honey as a dancer in his next video featuring Jadakiss & Sheek.  But within a few weeks her career escalates to a choreographer role working with some of the leading R'n'B and Hip Hop artists around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What Honey doesn't realise is that the music world is both fickle and pretentious and that to get to the top you can expect to be blackmailed or bribed along the way.</p>  \r\n\r\n<p>After ditching her best friend Gina (Joy Bryant - Showtime and Carmen: A Hip Hopera) to follow a glamorous career in dancing and leaving behind her loyal dance students Benny (Lil' Romeo - Romeo!) and Raymond (Zachary Williams - Ride or Die), who can she turn to when she is kicked out of the dance industry altogether?  At least she can find some comfort in her long-term admirer Chaz (played by Mekhi Phifer - Dawn of the Dead) who used to admire Honey from afar back in her dance school days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you liked Save the Last Dance, trust me you will love this film!  It excels far above Save the Last Dance in terms of the choreography which is superb!  Along with cameo appearances from music stars Missy Elliot, Ginuwine, Jadakiss & Sheek and Tweet, it is a truly Hip Hop experience for the ultimate underground music fan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jessica Alba reminds me of a young J-Lo with her Latino looks and sensational dance moves.  Alba is an up and coming movie star and definitely one to be watched.  And praise must be given to eight-year-old Zachary Williams who puts in a truly cute performance as Honey's favourite student Raymond.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	29	2011-03-26
30	1	16	\N	Starsky & Hutch	<p>Misfit cops David Starsky (Ben Stiller - Along Came Polly) and Ken Hutchinson (Owen Wilson - Shanghai Knights) are an unlikely match. Starsky likes to follow the police handbook to a 't', while Hutch's approach is to penetrate the criminal underworld by befriending notorious crime lords like enigmatic Huggy Bear (Snoop Dogg - Old School) to get a lead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When their boss asks them to become partners to uncover a drug heist, Starsky and Hutch employ unconventional and, at times, bizarre tactics to get to the truth. The pair find themselves in ridiculous scenarios trying to coax witnesses into spilling the beans. Hutch tries to woo jailbird Big Earl (Will Ferrell - Elf) to gather information while Starsky enters a danceathon in a nightclub to impress a pair of cheerleaders with important connections to the suspects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By enlisting the help of Huggy Bear, the two heroes are determined to make their boss proud for the first time by actually solving a case. However things may not go smoothly as their chief suspect is the charismatic humanitarian Reese Feldman (Vince Vaughn - Old School), a man with a devious mind and a serious moustache.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson are excellent as the comical 70's cop duo while Snoop Dogg puts in a cool performance as 'bling bling' crime lord Huggy Bear. Plus, watch out for a cameo appearance from the original guys themselves - Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul.</p>  \r\n\r\n<p>Starsky & Hutch is a fun-filled comedy with jokes galore mixed in with some great action. It is a goofy version of Bad Boys 2 and Charlie's Angels so if you liked these movies then buy it now, or rent it, or borrow it off someone who's bought it already.</p>\r\n\r\n	3	2011-03-26	30	2011-03-26
13	1	20	Blah	Spider-Man 2	<p>After a two year wait and being plagued by a big budget relentless advertising campaign, the long anticipated sequel to 2002's Spider-Man has finally arrived. Can it live up to the hype?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tobey Maguire (Seabiscuit) returns as the web slinging hero along with Kirsten Dunst (Mona Lisa Smile) as the angelic Mary Jane and James Franco (City by the Sea) as brooding billionaire friend Harry Osborn.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>For those not familiar with the comic, Peter Parker (Maguire) is a hapless teen who is gifted with superhuman abilities after accidentally being bitten by a genetically engineered spider. Peter can climb walls, fire webs from his wrists and has superhuman strength and heightened senses. With these powers Parker helps protect the innocent in the usual superhero way but beneath the hero he is still just a geeky teenager.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2002's blockbuster, Spider-Man, we witness the transformation of Peter Parker into Spider-Man while his best friend Harry (Franco) succeeds in dating Peter's sweetheart, Mary Jane (Dunst). As lovesick Peter struggles to juggle the role of superhero and college student, industrialist Norman Osborn, Harry's father, has been driven insane by a failed weapons experiment. Norman's fractured psyche jumps from billionaire to the psychotic madman known as the Green Goblin and sets about spreading terror across the city.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>In the final climatic battle, Spider-Man defeated the Green Goblin and as he returned the broken body of Norman Osborn to the billionaire's home, he is spotted by Harry who assumes Spider-Man had killed his father. As the film closed we saw Harry pledge to avenge his father's death and kill Spider-Man.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>So now after a two year break, Spider-Man is back and the story continues from where it left off. Harry has inherited his late father's business and has befriended (and funded) a brilliant scientist, Doctor Octavius (Alfred Molina - Chocolat), who hopes to create a new power source that could change the world. However as you may have guessed, something goes wrong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To complete his experiments, Doctor Octavius uses four powerful robotic arms attached directly to his spinal column and controlled by artificial intelligence. Unfortunately the experiment fails and Doctor Octavius is left permanently joined to his additional mechanical appendages and the artificial intelligence that controls the arms has overpowered his mind leaving him moderately unhinged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile Peter is having trouble balancing the life of a hero and the life of a young man. His grades are slipping and he has been fired from yet another job. Also the love of his life, the actress Mary Jane, has a new admirer. At home his aged Aunt is in debt and faces eviction and on top of everything else, his superhuman abilities are starting to fail him.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>As Peter Parker makes some life choices and sets about restarting his new life, the sinister Doctor Octavius forms a union with vengeful Harry and willing or not, Spider-man will be confronted with his biggest challenge yet.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Spider-Man 2 is a continuation of the original film and can boast a deeper and more engaging plot. The story is more emotive than the original and this helps the audience sympathise with characters in the extreme situations that a film of this genre tends to produce. Similarly the new villain, Doctor Octavius, has a more solid purpose and motive in this movie than the chaotic Green Goblin and his unique anatomy allows for some truly impressive action sequences. Set against these central and serious elements, Spider-Man 2 can also boast a healthy amount of humour, physical, satirical and subtle.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Tobey Maguire was apparently going to drop out of the movie due to a back complaint, thankfully he rose to the challenge and the movie benefits from his presence and impressive acting. Kirsten Dunst and James Franco put in adequate performances although special mention must be reserved for Alfred Molina's portrayal of a most formidable opponent both wise and powerful, Rosemary Harris as the gentle and perceptive Aunt May and the ever brilliant J K Simmons as the comedic and heartless editor of the Daily Bugle who relentlessly ridicules the lycra clad hero.</p>\r\n  \r\n<p>However, before we get carried away with compliments, this film is not perfect. A considerable amount of the film feels like a build up to a sequel, making the film feel like part two of a trilogy rather than direct sequel. A stop gap between two more pivotal stories. Also with a fleshier story there is less time for action and I fear that some of the audience expecting endless fight sequences may grow tired of lovesick heroes and broody millionaires.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If possible, director Sam Raimi has improved on his earlier success to make a blockbuster worthy of praise that stands above the other superhero sequels that crowd the multiplexes each summer. This film is a popcorn classic and will dominate the summer. Spider-Man 3 has been green lit (subtle pun for those who have seen the film) and I am excited already.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	15	2012-03-13
35	1	20	\N	The Girl Next Door	<p>Matthew Kidman(Emile Hirsch) is in his final year before college and is the perfect student. In other words he's a rather sad steady character who although not yet crowned king of geeks, is still a good contender for the title. Neither cool nor creepy, he is your average guy.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>You might have met him at school. You may even have 'been' him at school. Alone, bored, single with seemingly no chance of getting laid while all around you the more beautiful and cool people of your age seem to be having the time of their lives frolicking in the summer sun while you revise for your apparently life dependant exams.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Matt is the star pupil, academic, well mannered and honest yet he can't get laid and feels like his life is in a rut. He is bored and every time he imagines taking a risk, imagines stepping out, he then envisages a catastrophe, academic failure and social rejection. All that will change for Matthew very quickly when he meets the new girl next door, Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Danielle is different from the girls at Matt's school. To Matt she is smart, sexy and very independent but most of all, she actually seems interested in him. Love soon blossoms and just as Matt feels his confidence reaching a new height, his depraved movie obsessed friend Eli (Chris Marquette) awakens Matt from the dream. Danielle is a professional porn actress and part of Eli's extensive movie collection.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>From this point on the story develops in ways very reminiscent of the 80's classic 'Risky Business'. Matt, the mild mannered steady guy finds himself embroiled in the seedy world of porn when Danielle's employer, Kelly (Timothy Oliphant), turns up with a mind to return Danielle to her former video career, something Matt tries to prevent while also trying to maintain his squeaky clean image.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like 'Risky Business', this is a great teen movie and sex comedy but also has quite a nice coming of age story that ties the different threads together. Indeed if this film was intended to be a remake of the 80's classic, I would say it actually surpassed the original providing more laughs and a more engaging story. In fact if I were to shower more praise on this film, I am prepared to go so far as to say that this is the best teen movie I have seen since the first American Pie.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>This movie has good pace and good jokes and each time the audience feels the film is becoming predictable, it takes a new direction keeping us entertained and alert for each new adventure. The actors are first rate considering their youth and the combination of good jokes, beautiful women and romance will always ensure a wide audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>See it now before it is too late, if it is too late, rent it or buy it! It's that simple. We are dedicated to popcorn, this movie captures the essence of that genre and it is your duty to watch it.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	35	2011-03-26
36	1	20	\N	Constantine	<p>John Constantine (Keanu Reeves - Matrix Revolutions) is a man cursed with visions and haunted by the dark truth. The world is full of half angels and half demons who whisper in our ear and may turn a man from saint to sinner depending on that man's own character. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The balance between the forces of good and evil is very fragile and there are those evil spirits, half breeds, who try to swing the balance toward the darker side. When they do, John tries to knock them back into line. John knows the tricks to move between the planes of existence, to exorcise demons and to help the innocent. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>So you think John sounds like a hero, you're wrong. His motivation is not to help the innocent and punish the wicked, he hopes that if he does enough good deeds he may buy his way into heaven. You see, John is an asshole. He is a self serving chain smoker with a pessimistic attitude and little patience for anyone, even his friends. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a series of mysterious events and attacks John begins to suspect that something really nasty is afoot. He is soon contacted by a young cop, Angela (Rachel Weisz - Confidence) who feels that there is something more sinister to her twin sister's apparent suicide. As John and Angela investigate the mystery surrounding the death, they stumble upon a diabolical plan. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on the Hellblazer series of comics, Constantine has a story darker than most and a strong antihero as the lead character. I confess that I have not read the comics myself but from some subtle inquiries it would appear the main premise has been adhered to. Apparently the original John Constantine was a scouser and a Sting lookalike, thankfully that image has been replaced by dark haired American, Keanu Reeves. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The movie has a fairly complicated story for what is, at the end of the day, an effects filled action movie, a point in its favour especially when the said effects are often a little disappointing. The effects of angels wings, putrefying corpses humming with flies and chests bulging with evil spirits are all quite good but when we see some of the more elaborate CGI demon's, things start to crack. Also when Constantine finally goes on a rampage, his victims turn to ash and flame in a way very reminiscent of the Blade movies. On the up side there are some great jokes and enough thought provoking questions to keep everyone entertained. Overall this is a crowd pleaser and has sequel stamped all over it. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Piano Keys is suitably cool as the self centred demon fighter who is reminiscent of Dirty Harry crossed with The Exorcist. Likewise Weisz as the nave cop looks suitably aghast for most of the movie and wears quite a lot of tight wet clothing. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>Tilda Swinton (Adaptation) crops up occasionally and is fantastic as the helpful, if blunt, guiding angel Gabriel. Meanwhile Djimon Hounsou (In America) once again provides great presence and deep tones as the neutral and enigmatic nightclub owner Midnite, a character so cool he steals his scenes from the main guy Keanu. Also keep an eye out for a brief appearance from the ever entertaining Peter Stormare (Bad Boys 2). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you like comic adaptations, dark movies concerned with distorted reality or just plain simple demon killing carnage, this is a movie for you. With a blend of 'Blade' style darkness and action mixed with Dogma's comedic religious observations, Constantine is a good popcorn flick. This film has some moments of greatness and although it may be let down by some stock action sequences, it has enough of a story and some cool characters to earn it that important third star.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	36	2011-03-26
37	1	20	\N	Gothika	<p>Halle Berry (Catwoman) stars as Dr Miranda Grey in Director/Actor Mathieu Kassovitz's dark and disturbing psychological thriller set in and around a hospital for the criminally insane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While driving home from work one dark and rainy evening, Miranda is forced to take a minor detour to get across a swollen river and as she drives through a covered bridge when...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Never trust covered bridges. They are an ill omen. In Beetlejuice the happy couple Adam and Barbara entered the afterlife after crashing through a covered bridge and in Sleepy Hollow poor Ichabod Crane was stabbed in the chest after the headless horseman ambushed him on a covered bridge. Not to mention the bridges of Madison County (shudder shudder).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Miranda slowly wakes up to find herself in a cell wearing prison issue clothes, her hair is a state and she can tell she has been under heavy sedation. Her memory is a complete blank after her accident and somehow she has become an inmate of her own prison. What happened?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a short interview with her colleague Dr Graham (Robert Downey Jr - The Singing Detective), Miranda is informed that she has been formally charged for a brutal murder. Miranda cannot believe the charges and sets about trying to regain her memories. However her attempts at recovery are disturbed by ghostly visitations. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>While living in the prison Miranda witnesses strange goings on. She is trying to unravel the mystery of her apparent murderous behaviour while confronting visitations from a ghostly young girl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Halle Berry is ever impressive as Dr Grey showing once again that she is more than just a pretty face. In support Robert Downey Jr gives a good performance as a loyal friend but also trained professional trying to help Miranda find her way through both her condition and the mystery. Similarly Penelope Cruz gives an admirable if short performance as a disturbed fellow inmate who believes she is raped by the devil in her cell each evening and slowly befriends Miranda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gothika was a pleasant surprise. I expected a play it by numbers psychological thriller but Director Mathieu Kassovitz delivers a dark and, at times, frightening thriller. Kassovitz is quite new to Hollywood cinema but people may remember him for the cult French film noir, La Haine or for his acting role as Nino, the love interest in 2001's fabulous classic, Amelie. Gothika is very dark and the plot takes enough turns to keep you on the edge of your seat. The tension does not subside throughout the whole film and when you combine that tension with the fine performances of everyone involved, the movie makes a great connection with the audience so that even the incredible become plausible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would recommend Gothika to anyone who enjoyed Identity, Silence of the Lambs or Red Dragon. Thrills, frights and bumps in the night. On a parting note, if anyone can work out why this film is called Gothika, please let us know.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	37	2011-03-26
38	1	20	\N	Hidalgo	<p>Frank Hopkins (Vigo Mortensen - Lord of the Rings) was born from both American and Native American parents. When we begin this story, both Frank and his famous horse, Hidalgo (T.J) have won countless long distance races across the united states and now Frank and Hidalgo perform as one of the numerous acts in Buffalo Bill's travelling circus. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frank is haunted by memories of the Native American atrocities that he witnessed as a messenger for the US cavalry. As part Native American, Frank feels he has failed his ancestry but at the same time he hides his heritage to avoid the persecution he sees each day. Frank is a lost soul and he numbs his pain with drink. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of Buffalo Bill's circus, Hidalgo is advertised as the fastest all terrain long distance horse in the world. This claim has caught the eye of the Arabian Sheikh Riyadh (Omarif - Lawrence of Arabia) who takes great pride in the breeding of horses and takes it as an insult that the American cross breed mustang could ever beat his own thoroughbred horses. Sheikh Riyadh therefore sends an emissary to the United States to invite Frank and his horse Hidalgo to compete in the greatest and most gruelling long distance horse race, the ocean of fire. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on a true story, what follows is the adventure of Frank Hopkins and his horse Hidalgo as they compete in the race facing challenges, from not only the elements and the desert, but unscrupulous competitors who hope to win at any cost and also some other more elusive adversaries pulling political strings unseen. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following on from the spectacle of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, it would be difficult for Vigo Mortensen to star in any film that may separate him from the role of a warrior or a king. When I went to see Hidalgo I did not have high expectations and am happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting to see two hours of a man talking to a horse somewhere in the desert and instead found an adventure flick full of action. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hidalgo is a very good film and manages to cram quite a lot of story into just over two hours. Vigo Mortensen gives a strong performance in the lead role as Frank Hopkins, managing to combine the dark reflective nature of a man losing his identity with the confident self assured swagger of a western hero. However credit must be given to his co star, the horse TJ, that stars as Hidalgo. The horse is actually a character in the movie. This doesn't mean he talks like some Disney creation, rather he seems to interact with Vigo on screen giving a kind of buddy relationship to the movie and allowing some good comedy. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In support, Omar Shariff is ever impressive as Sheikh Riyadh facing up to the changing world around him yet remaining traditional. I was expecting a cameo performance from the great actor and was happy to see him with a more substantial role. At his advancing age he can still wield a sword convincingly and has great presence on screen. Compared to the years of movie experience of a cinema giant, Louise Lombard as Lady Anne Davenport is a relative newcomer yet she gets a chance to shine on screen as the charismatic and highly competitive horse trainer and owner with her own interest in the race. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>All in all Hidalgo was far better than I expected. Having said that, certain sections of the film feel a little slow although this may indeed be intentional, possibly reflective of the solitude and loneliness of the desert, and the film feels a little long. Director Joe Johnson (Jurassic Park 3) has created a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good old fashioned adventure flick reliant more on actual performance than ceaseless CGI.</p>\r\n\r\n	3	2011-03-26	38	2011-03-26
39	1	16	\N	Shall We Dance	<p>Richard Gere (Chicago) dons his dancing shoes for the second time since his stint as hotshot lawyer, Billy Flynn, in the film musical Chicago. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gere plays John Clark, a lacklustre lawyer who follows a monotonous daily routine and craves some excitement in his life.  While he leads a normal and happy family life with wife Beverly (Susan Sarandon - Alfie) and his two kids, John feels there is something missing. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyday on his way home from work, John spots a beautiful young ballroom dance teacher gazing out of her studio window.  To his own surprise, he soon finds himself enrolling in dance classes just to get a closer glimpse of Paulina (Jennifer Lopez - Jersey Girl). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>What started off as an attraction between the pair soon turns into admiration and determination as each character supports the other in achieving their dream. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>Along the way John meets a whole host of bubbly and lively friends, from big sweaty oaf Vern (Omar Benson Miller - 8 Mile), Casanova Chic (Bobby Cannavale - The Guru) and the ever scary dancing machine, the Bobbie-nator (Lisa Ann Walter - Bruce Almighty). </p> \r\n\r\n<p>As John struggles to keep his little hobby a secret from his wife, her mind starts to race as the late nights and the happier mood of her husband scream to her that he is having an affair. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gere gives an impressive and suave performance as shy lawyer-turned-graceful-dancer John and still maintains his sex appeal even at the age of 55.  Jennifer Lopez redeems herself after a hat trick of flop films in a role that was made for her and that she delivers well.  The chemistry between Gere and Lopez is electric and Gere does well to keep up with the natural dancing talent of Lopez in some tough dance sequences.  Other notable performances and much of the comedy is provided by Stanley Tucci (The Terminal) as fellow dancer and office worker Link and Lisa Ann Walter as energetic partner, Bobbie. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don't miss some great Latino and ballroom dance steps in this film, it shows how hard the cast worked in their dance training.  Shall We Dance should also be commended for its thought-provoking, true-to-life dialogue and heartfelt scenes.  A film for all the family, watch it if you liked Strictly Ballroom, Chicago or BBC1's Strictly Come Dancing.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	39	2011-03-26
40	1	20	\N	The Island	<p>Lincoln Six Echo has a boring but pleasant existence living with other survivors of the contamination, an event that rendered almost all the earth inhospitable except the few bubble cities where survivors managed to find safety. In fact, the only place untouched by the contamination is the Island, an idyllic Eden where a new society is forming. In their utopian bubble, Lincoln and his friends live a life of strict routine while they all wait to win the lottery and a chance to move once and for all to the Island. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As day passes day and routine repeats Lincoln is growing restless. Why he should feel that way he cannot explain as everything in his waking life is content. The only real thing bothering him is his dreams. Repeated nightmares where he is thrown from a boat and drowned by unknown assailants while being watched by his friend, Jordan Two Delta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lincoln's restless spirit and curiosity force him to push the rules as he searches the fringes of his city and one fateful day he explores a system of tunnels and witnesses an event that shatters his reality. The lottery is a fake, the Island doesn't exist and all those who leave his fair city are actually being harvested for spare parts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scared and confused Lincoln returns to his bubble city to warn his friend Jordan but time is running short, Jordan has just won a trip to the Island. To save their lives Lincoln and Jordan escape the city and leaving behind them all that they know as they race into reality. Meanwhile the corrupt administrator of the clone city, Dr Merrick, fearful the world will learn the truth of his dubious human farm, hires an elite assassin, Albert Laurent, to track down his escaped products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What follows is an action packed frantic chase movie as the nave clones run from the relentless assassins and try to expose the truth. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with his earlier films such as Bad Boys 2, Armageddon and Pearl Harbour, Michael Bay once again demonstrates his ability to direct fantastic and thrilling chase sequences and special effects. Yet somehow this movie falls short of its potential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was good acting from Ewan McGregor (Star Wars) as nave hero Lincoln Six Echo and also as sleazy Scottish progenitor, Tom Lincoln, both characters interacting well with each other. Guess all that blue screen work with George Lucas paid off in the end. Similarly Scarlett Johansson (In Good Company) was beautiful and dynamic as Jordan Two Delta, although her only challenge was to run around looking confused and vulnerable. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adding menace and filling the shoes of the obligatory English villain, Sean Bean (National Treasure) was suitably cold hearted and conniving as omnipotent Dr Merrick while Djimon (aka Digimon) Hounsou (Constantine) added physical threat as the relentless pursuer, Albert Laurent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what went wrong, why only three stars? While this film was stylish and energetic it failed to deliver on what could have been a great thought provoking science fiction blockbuster. What could so easily have been a 'Minority Report' ended up being yet another 'I Robot'.This movie could easily have tapped into a relatively unexplored yet controversial area of science but every time the characters got into a half interesting conversation they suddenly felt the need to run, hide or blow something up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The science fiction literati may recognise striking similarities with Michael Marshall Smith's classic book <i>"Spares"</i>, that follows the story of a detective who liberates seven clones. <i>"Spares"</i> was recently purchased by Dreamworks but has yet to be developed. The Island's writer, Caspian Tredwell-Owen, would appear to have borrowed heavily from this and the popular classic <i>"Logan's Run"<i> to make a chase movie that dips a toe into intellegent sci fi but doesn't dare take the plunge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would recommend this movie for the popcorn crowd. Despite my many grumbles as a science fiction fan this movie boasts some of the best chase sequences this year and is, by far, the most stylish action movie of the summer season, albeit stuffed from beginning to end with shameless adverts (keep an eye out for Puma, MSN Messenger and Calvin Klein). Fans of Michael Bay action films, Ewan McGregor and films such as The Matrix, Logans Run and Minority Report should all find this flick great fun if a little thin. </p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	40	2011-03-26
41	1	16	\N	50 First Dates	<p>Henry Roth (Adam Sandler - Anger Management) is a serial dater and commitment-phobe.  He has sworn himself off dating any women for more than a week, or any woman local to his home on Hawaii. Then of course fate has it that he will meet Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore - Charlie's Angel 2), a regular at his local caf. Lucy is caring and artistic and is Henry finds himself smitten. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what Henry doesn't realise is that Lucy has short-term memory loss and she may not remember him tomorrow.  So Henry embarks on a series of weird and wacky escapades, with the help of his sex crazed friend Ula (Rob Schneider - Hot Chick) in an effort to grab Lucy's attention. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a rocky start, Henry is introduced to Lucy's over protective father Marlin (Blake Clark - The Ladykillers) and her buff brother Doug (Sean Austin - LOTR) who warn him not to hurt their precious Lucy.  Henry faces a tough challenge to convince Lucy's family that he has genuine feelings for her. However this is not as challenging as the daily heartbreak of trying to woo the woman of his dreams only to lose her each evening. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following on from 2003's successful comedy movie, Anger Management, director Peter Segal once again puts an original spin on the well trodden romantic comedy genre. Set against the beautiful back drop of Hawaii, 50 first Dates is a gentle and touching romantic comedy. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adam Sandler puts in a great comedic performance once again with a character that grows and matures on screen, facing the challenges and responsibilities inherent with dating an amnesiac. Drew Barrymore puts in a wonderful performance as the leading lady despite her bad reviews for her performance as bad girl Dylan in 2003's Charlie's Angels 2. In support comedy star Rob Schneider (Hot Chick) adds eccentric laughs as a wild Hawaiian in heat and not forgetting Sean Austin's hilarious performance as the buff but dim brother, Doug. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you liked Adam Sandler in romantic comedy Big Daddy and Barrymore in the chick flick Never Been Kissed, then go see this slushy romance.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	41	2011-03-26
42	1	20	\N	Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story	<p><em> "It's time to separate the weak from the chafed, the men from the boys, and the awkwardly feminine from the possibly Canadian."  - Cotton McKnight, ESPN 8 </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn - Old School) has a very relaxed approach to life. He is the owner and manager of Average Joe's gym, a sanctuary for many weird and wonderful customers including the wannabe cheerleader, Justin (Justin Long - Galaxy Quest), a middle aged obscure sports fanatic, Gordon (Stephen Root - The Ladykillers) and a man who believes he is a pirate known as Steve (Alan Tudyk - A Knights Tale). However none of these characters are as off the wall as White Goodman (Ben Stiller - Starsky & Hutch), the owner of Global Gym, Average Joe's neighbour and rival. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>White is a vain megalomaniac with a serious hair style and he has his crazed eyes fixed on Average Joe's, hoping to buy out the rival gym from beneath Peter. To achieve this goal, White arranges for an audit of Average Joe's accounts. The beautiful lawyer sent to check the books, Kate Veatch (Christine Taylor - Zoolander) soon discovers a $50k financial shortfall that may be the death nail for the rundown gym. Unless Peter can find the cash he will lose the gym and his band of freaks will be homeless. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily, Gordon's obsession with obscure sports provides a far fetched solution. The barmy high school game of Dodgeball holds a world championship in Vegas with a $50k prize for the winners. Only problem is neither Peter nor his fellow miscreants have ever played Dodgeball. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>Unfazed by this minor setback, Peter enlists the help of a crippled former Dodgeball champion, Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn - Men in Black) to help prep a team. Unfortunately Patches has a few loose screws and his training may kill the team before they even get to play and his motivational speeches sound like they have been lifted from Full Metal Jacket. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><em> "You're all are about as useful as a poopie flavoured lolly pop." - Patches O'Houlihan</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the training wasn't bad enough, fitness freak White decides to enter his own team of perfect specimens to ensure the defeat of Easy Joe's. What follows is a sports competition like nothing you've ever seen. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ben Stiller is simply brilliant as the dim-witted egotistical White Goodman and the contrast of that loud obnoxious character with the mellow dry wit of Vince Vaughn as Peter La Fleur makes for a great comic combination. In support Rip Torn is hilarious as the wheelchair bound wrench wielding maniac Patches O'Houlihan whose direct no nonsense comments are side ripping and Christine Taylor adds more than just a pretty face as the unicorn obsessed lawyer who joins the Easy Joe's team. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The script to this movie is full of great quotes that raise this movie above the other similarly veined formulaic sports underdog stories and make for a comedy classic. Each of the team's competitor's has their own funny little side story going on that adds to the zany plot and allow each minor character a chance to add a little spin that makes the comedy even more enjoyable. In addition there are some great celebrity cameos that take you by surprise and gain a few further laughs. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>Dodgeball: A True Underdog story is without a doubt the funniest film I have seen in years and is a sure fire hit for the summer. Regardless of if you enjoy physical comedy, satirical comedy, irony or situation comedy, Dodgeball has something for you and will entertain even the most stoic of corpses. See it!</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	42	2011-03-26
43	1	20	\N	Dawn of the Dead	<p>The cinema darkens and the film begins. A beautiful and overworked nurse (Sarah Polley - Go, eXistenZ) finishes a long shift and makes her way home and as she approaches her house she stops to chat to a young girl learning to roller skate near her drive. Once home the nurse is greeted by her boyfriend and they make love in the shower while the TV presents an emergency bulletin.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>We now fast forward to the morning, the couple stir in bed and the boyfriend notices the little young girl standing in the shadowy doorway to their room. As she moves into the light we see that her face is smeared with blood. The boyfriend moves to the girl to see if she needs help. Within minutes she has bitten into the jugular of the boyfriend like a rabid beast.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>With blood spraying from his neck the boyfriend manages to force the little girl from the room and close the door. The nurse immediately tends to his wounds but the blood loss is severe. She tries to call the emergency services but all lines are down. She returns to her blood stained boyfriend to try and sustain him but he fades and dies in her arms. As she attempts to resuscitate her boyfriend he returns violently to life and just like the little girl he is gripped with a blood lust reaching wildly for the nurse so that he may taste her flesh. Caught between despair and panic the nurse escapes through her en-suite bathroom window, gets in the car and drives.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>As she makes her way through town she is confronted at every turn by signs of massacre and bedlam. The world has turned on its head and the populace is either mad with panic or rabid like wolves. This is the beginning of Dawn of the dead, all of the above happening before the opening credits roll. Unfortunately, that's the only engaging part of this film.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>On her journey the nurse meets a quiet and severe cop (Ving Rhames - Pulp Fiction, Dark Blue) and a collection of other stray people and they find refuge in a shopping mall. After arrival at the mall the character of the nurse becomes secondary as we are introduced to a variety of additional characters. Unfortunately we meet too many characters. The net result is that we never really engage with any of the wannabe survivors and so we care little what will or in most cases does, happen to them.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Dawn of the Dead is a remake of a 1978 original, however a fresh set of special effects and updated scenery is not enough to reinvigorate the well trodden Zombie genre. The flow of the film is uneven and often meandering with seemingly no direction. True this may have been an intentional decision to emphasise the lack of hope for the characters, however if this was its purpose it was less than apparent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As mentioned earlier, each character receives barely enough attention to foster any relationship and so the audience is not necessarily drawn into the horror of the situation. The horror sequences are scattered and unoriginal and so the audience half expects the eventual demise of certain characters. The few attempts at emotional contact with the audience are weak and the cheap laughs and jumpy moments are the only points that the audience actually stir.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before giving up all hope on this flick maybe I should spend a paragraph talking about its merits. There were some good effects in this movie and the occasional bouts of humour provided some levity. Sarah Polley gave an adequate performance in the lead role but Ving Rhames just looked like he wanted to be somewhere else, as vacant as his characters back story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I were to sum up Dawn of the Dead in one word it would need to be 'Thin'. With recent zombie films such 'Resident Evil' and '28 Days Later' and the eagerly anticipated 'Shaun of the Dead', Dawn of the Dead would need to offer something new to capture any credit from these other movies. Unfortunately there is little originality and so this movie will hopefully fade from memory. I would only recommend this film to those with no alternative or a curious affinity and devotion to mindless horror movies.</p>\r\n	1	2011-03-26	43	2011-03-26
44	1	10	\N	Fahrenheit 911	<p>Michael Moore is to the US administration what Jonny Rotten was to the Royal Family. Put simply, he detests President Bush with the kind of passion normally reserved for flea-ridden vermin. Don't expect, then, his film about George "Dubbya's" dubious election victory, handling of the September 11 atrocities and subsequent war on terror to be a work of fine balance and understatement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take the scene where Moore, the best-selling author of the brilliant Stupid White Men, castigates the US government for allowing members of the Bin Laden family to fly home to Saudi Arabia from the States in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, when virtually all other flights were grounded. He sets a shot of planes taking off to the strains of 'We gotta get outta this place/if it's the last thing we ever do'. It's disturbing and amusing at the same time which pretty well sums up much of Moore's work and, in this instance, his subject too - the President.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone remembers where he or she was when they heard about 9/11. Dubbya certainly does and Moore certainly remembers where Dubbya was. He shows us, in fact. Bush is seen in a classroom full of kids as a shadowy figure whispers the news in his ear. Minutes later, Bush is still in his seat as he is told that a second plane has struck. For several minutes afterwards, Bush remains in his seat, reading My Little Goat or something with the children. Amusing, and disturbing, once more. It's hard not to feel uneasy when laughing about such atrocities but Moore wants us to laugh. To him, Bush is laughable, a laughing stock, no less. The sooner we wake up to that, the sooner Moore believes Bush will be out of a job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arguably, Moore is presenting a caricature of Bush here. But footage from US news channels demonstrates how the President is perfectly capable of making a fool of himself. After telling one camera crew how he'll defeat the terrorists, he pauses, marking the end of the interview, then says: "Now watch this drive." The camera pans back to show Bush on a golf course, preparing to take a swing. It's a kind of metaphor, you might conclude, for the way Bush has conducted his foreign affairs. If in doubt, just take a wild swing at it and hope for the best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And so we come to Iraq. There's a shocking interview with a presidential advisor who reveals just what he was asked to 'discover' post-9/11. And there's lots of footage of a woman from Moore's home town whose family members have been in the armed forces for years, and who changes her view on the righteousness of Bush's war when her son becomes embroiled in the Iraq conflict. Here Moore is playing on the heartstrings, but the scale of his documentary seems to have shrunk, and is the worse for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite this, it's impossible to leave the cinema without reaction. Moore's film is powerful, amusing, insightful, one-sided and penetrating. What on earth would Dubbya make of it? Or perhaps he couldn't sit still long enough to watch it.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	44	2011-03-26
45	1	20	\N	The Alamo	<p>In the fledgling United States of 1836, Texas came under attack from the Mexican army led by the ruthless Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana. The only thing stopping Santa Ana's army from sweeping into Texas was a small fort, The Alamo, defended by a group of defiant soldiers. In this latest portrayal of one of America's most pivotal battles, John Lee Hancock (The Rookie) has pulled together an all star cast and presented the movie on an epic scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>James Bowie (Jason Patric - Narc) is an alcoholic hard as nails warrior with a history of bloody confrontation. Meanwhile William Travis (Patrick Wilson) is a well- groomed self important wannabe leader. Of equal rank but dissimilar temperament, these two men do not hit it off well. However, as the army of Santa Ana slowly moves towards the Alamo, these two competing soldiers must pull together and lead a limited number of men against overwhelming forces. To assist them in this unenviable task, the legendary hero and political senator Davey Crockett (Billy Bob Thornton - Love Actually) travels to the Alamo to help boost morale before the fort is besieged and surrounded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile back in the relative safety of Texas itself, General Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid - The Day After Tomorrow) is aware of the Alamo's plight and tries to assemble an army that may help defend Texas from the Mexican attack and save those trapped within the Alamo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story of the Alamo is full of bravery and sacrifice and was one of the most pivotal battles in American history. In this latest portrayal of those events, John Lee Hancock has made a beautiful movie. The film has a good build up towards the eventual siege and the subsequent battles. The cinematography is astounding and some of the panoramic shots give this film the air of an Oscar possibility. Sadly the film feels a little over stylised and at times you feel that some of the emotional scenes are being laid on a bit thick.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>In the acting department the story is really focused primarily on four distinctly different characters. In the role of Jason Bowie, Jason Patric puts in an adequate performance but sadly not a career best and is out acted by relative newcomer Patrick Wilson as confident but unpopular William Travis. Alongside the story of these two competing egos, Billy Bob Thornton steals the show as the charismatic Davey Crockett taunting the Mexicans and providing the majority of the humour in an otherwise heavy story. Finally Dennis Quaid puts in a solid performance as alcoholic General Houston, distant from the siege and powerless to assist.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>After watching the Alamo it is difficult to find a recent movie that may act as a comparator to help guide you, my readers. Once again we see a small band of defiant men besieged by an overwhelming enemy similar to that seen in The Last Samurai or even the Lord of the Ring's: The Two Towers and Return of The King. However in comparison to those three great movies, the Alamo seems to be lacking a certain key ingredient. I cannot put my finger on it but somehow the portrayal of the bloody events seems a little clean and over stylised, not that this should ruin your enjoyment of what is, at the end of the day, a very good film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Expect to see this film on TV every Christmas or Bank Holiday weekend for the next few decades, probably after an Only Fools & Horses repeat and the day after The Great Escape.</p>\r\n\r\n	3	2011-03-26	45	2011-03-26
46	1	20	\N	Collateral	<p>After a three-year break from the director's chair, Michael Mann (Ali) presents us with another great crime thriller. Eagerly anticipated, it has been hard to escape the ad campaign for Collateral and now, at last, it is here. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Max (Jamie Foxx - Ali) is a taxi driver in LA and takes a certain degree of pride in his work. Like many of us, Max has ambitions for something better than his current occupation but to make ends meet he works the nightshift to save money towards his dreams. He drives the best route for each passenger and is an all round good guy, passive and friendly but some evenings are more stressful than others. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>One evening after dropping off a beautiful lawyer, Max is left with the possibility of a date from the lovely lady and it looks like his evening may not be so bad after all. That is until chance or destiny decree that his next fare, Vincent (Tom Cruise - The Last Samurai) will be a customer like no other. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>Vincent is a contract killer who has five people to knock off before his morning flight. Initially unaware of Vincent's profession and with an agreed fare of $600, Max agrees to drive Vincent to his various 'meetings'. After a falling body smashes his windscreen, Max's realises his client is a killer but with a gun to his head he has little choice but to drive Vincent to his other targets. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Set against the backdrop of LA by night and using a variety of filming techniques, Collateral is a dark movie with a similar visceral style that has become the trademark of a Michael Mann film. Following Ali (2001), Mann has returned to the crime thriller genre that has provided some of his greatest movies such as Manhunter (1986), L.A. Takedown (1989) and an all star remake of that same movie re-titled Heat (1995). </p> \r\n\r\n<p>All of those films had great character presence and yet kept the tension at a good level and story moving at a steadily growing pace. In addition the script work was tuned to provide some great and memorable dialogue without becoming too stodgy. I am happy to say that Collateral follows this tradition and is another great movie for Mann's already impressive portfolio. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Collateral is a tense thriller and yet also a character piece. Essentially you have the quiet humble man who takes pride in his work who is confronted and essentially tied to a destructive soulless being who is relentless and ruthless. The relationship between these two polar characters and the harsh sequence of events that they share is a recipe for a great movie but at the same time is dependant on the two lead actors. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the lead role as the quiet man thrown into chaos, Jamie Foxx puts across his character with such ease and timing that pretty soon he is Max. The emotional roller coaster ride that Max goes through in this movie would give any actor a good workout and Foxx is so convincing that I think he steals the movie from the real star attraction, Tom Cruise. Following a whole long line of roles as the good guy, it is refreshing to see Tom Cruise play a bad guy and he does so perfectly. In fact I think this is the best performance I have seen from Mr Cruise since Jerry Maguire in 1996. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>Sporting silver hair that is highlighted by a grey/silver suit, this is a different kind of role for Cruise and in Collateral very quickly the good guy image is gone to be replaced by someone more truly menacing and threatening. The coldness of Vincent's character and his sharp cynical dialogue do not allow a great amount of expression but to get across the sheer ruthlessness is a challenge in itself and Cruise succeeds admirably. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>Supporting the taxi couple, there are a number of good performances from the likes of Mark Ruffalo (13 Going On 30) as a tenacious detective following the body count, Jada Pinkett Smith (Matrix Revolutions) as a lonely lawyer who befriends Max early in the movie, and Irma P. Hall (The Ladykillers) as Max's humorous albeit blunt bedridden mother. Sadly despite good acting, the movie doesn't really provide much room for these additional characters yet in their own way they each help widen the scope of the story and allow a few interesting diversions along the way. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Collateral is a slick stylish thriller with some good action, some good dialogue and a story that is both simple and captivating. If you are a fan of the movies Heat, Leon or Infernal Affairs or a fan of Tom Cruise, this is a must see movie. It's definitely the most stylish crime thriller I have seen in the last year.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	46	2011-03-26
47	1	20	\N	Bad Santa	<p>It's November and that means it's nearly Christmas. The Oxford Street lights have been turned on, the shops are stocking all manner of glittery little home decorations and the cinema is starting to show more and more family movies with feel good messages. Wading into this warm and fuzzy period of sentimentality like a elephant in heat comes a seemingly new antihero, Bad Santa. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Set in America, Bad Santa tells the story of a low life crook, Willie (Billy Bob Thornton - The Alamo) who spends each Christmas raiding shopping malls. Dressed as Santa and ably assisted by his pint sized companion Marcus (Tony Cox - Me, Myself & Irene) disguised as an elf, Willie gains employment at a mall as the kiddy's attraction. While working at a mall Willie and Marcus have the perfect cover to scope the joint before robbing it blind on Christmas Eve. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Willie is a disgusting character who has real social issues stemming from a life of self abuse and neglect. He drinks ceaselessly, vomits in alleys, peas himself, screams at children and regularly enjoys invading the back door of big women in the changing rooms. His vile personality does not hold much hope for the future. That is until he meets a quiet plump kid at the mall who comes from a home where he lives alone with a batty grandmother. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>After fleeing an invader at his motel Willie decides to stay at the home of the quiet kid. As he watches the life of the kid, Willie finds himself on the very slow path to redemption but alas the journey is just too slow. At first it would appear that this is a new spin on the Christmas redemption story but it doesn't actually offer anything new except perhaps a new level of disgraceful behavior. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Billy Bob Thornton puts across a truly horrible character quite well but despite being the central character he is not given much scope to show his acting ability. In short he is an asshole throughout the entire movie. Tony Cox as Marcus gives a good performance as the mastermind behind the criminal duo's exploits. His character, if anything, is more engaging but remains secondary to the story. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>In the movie we also meet relative movie newcomer Lauren Graham who is quite appealing as the barmaid with a Santa fetish who helps with Willie's social transformation. Also Bernie Mac (Charlies Angles Full Throttle) as a slippery security chief more crooked than the thieves he is employed to stop. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all I was disappointed by Bad Santa. It had a great premise but failed to deliver anything truly memorable. It was as thin as its main star and as entertaining as a night out in Harlow. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>What was disappointing was that this movie tried to sell itself as a different kind of Christmas movie but after sitting through it there is little real originality here. It is at the end of the day yet another comedy Christmas redemption story albeit a far cry from Dickens 'A Christmas Carol' or last years 'Elf'. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>Also the film is defined as a dark comedy yet in a half full cinema on its opening weekend it barely raised a handful of titters through the entire show. The few times I did laugh were far apart and I was well aware that my ass was going numb waiting for something interesting to happen in the film. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>On leaving the cinema I think my friend Steve summed it up quite well, 'Bad Santa is not a long film, but it didn't finish soon enough.'</p>\r\n	1	2011-03-26	47	2011-03-26
48	1	15	\N	The Manchurian Candidate	<p>Mind Control. Paranoia. Murky conspiracies. Shadowy organisations. Murder. Assassination. The Manchurian Candidate has all the elements for a top notch thriller and a great night in front of the big screen. The makers of this film should be sued for false advertising. It's about as thrilling as an Antiques Roadshow special. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Denzel Washington (Antwone Fisher) stars as Major Ben Marco a Gulf War veteran who suffers from a recurring nightmare about the night his patrol was ambushed in an incident that won a member of his squad, Sgt Raymond Shaw, the congressional medal of honour. When another survivor of the fire fight reveals that he to has identical dreams, the Major begins to fear that the malevolent figures from his subconscious are real and have nefarious plans for Shaw who, having followed his mother into politics, is only an election away from becoming the new Vice President of the United States of America. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first hour of the film is so deathly slow that I began to question whether or not anything of consequence was actually at stake in the film. Characters that are barely introduced take up unnecessary large amounts of screen time without actually progressing the plot in any discernable way. Half an hour is wasted in the company of checkout girl Rosie (Kimberly Elise - John Q) who thankfully did have a role to play at the movies climax, although not quite a big enough part to justify her previous involvement. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Denzel Washington gives one of his most forgettable performances while Meryl Streep (The Hours) struts around grinning manically and acting strangely camp. Only Liev Schreiber (Scream 2) puts in a decent performance as Raymond Shaw, an intriguing mix of innocent patsy, arrogant arse and murderous psycho. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film is only saved from complete tedium because Marco eventually plucks up the courage to take his suspicions about Shaw to a rival politician played by the always watchable Jon Voight (Anaconda). Finally forced to confront the threat that the Major poses, the villains finally actually do something villainous and the film jogs to its neat and straight forward end. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Absurdly the Manchurian Corporation, far from being an omnipotent force of global evil, comes across as about as threatening and powerful as W H Smith's. The representatives of the company include Dean Stockwell (Al from television's Quantum Leap) but in a criminal waste of an actor, he gets two lines before being sidelined. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chief problem with the film seems to be an acute lack of ambition from the creators, who seem to be frightened to do anything different with their premise. Perhaps the script did include some interesting plot twists but they must have been surgically removed so as not to confuse the audience. Instead what we get is a conspiracy that is so obvious that Washington's character should have worked out what the plotters were up to within the first fifteen minutes. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Even the set pieces feel small and insignificant. The opening battle scene seems to have staged in a sand pit in the producers back garden with a couple of his neighbours popping over to play the part of evil Iraqi ambushers. One explosion and a burst of machine gun fire later and the film's one action sequence is all over except for a couple of helicopters that swoop in before busting into cgi flames that would have looked as realistic if I had knocked out the graphics on my Amega 600. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The people responsible for this dull remake should be tied up and forced to watch The Day of the Jackal and episodes of 24 until they apologise and promise to try harder.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	48	2011-03-26
49	1	20	\N	The Bourne Identity	<p>Reminiscent of the great cold war thrillers of the seventies and eighties, The Bourne Identity is a great espionage thriller, the likes of which have not been seen since the sleeper hit Ronin back in 1998. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>While fishing in the Mediterranean, a group of French fisherman find an unconscious man (Matt Damon - Ocean's 11) floating in the water. They drag him aboard and as they tend to the man's numerous gun shot wounds they discover a small pellet under the skin of the wounded man's thigh. The pellet emits a laser light that displays a bank address and account details. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wounded man recovers from his injuries but has no memory of his past. With only the small pellet as a clue, plus his ability to speak numerous languages, he sets off to visit the bank and find his identity. Unfortunately when he gets to the bank and opens the security box for his account, he doesn't find one identity but many. The box is filled with money, countless passports with countless names but only one face and most worryingly, a gun. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>More confused than ever the man takes the money and the passports and leaves the bank hoping to find some answers from the few clues he now possesses. However someone at the bank has recognised him and behind the scenes people start to watch him. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a brief visit to the embassy, Jason realises he is a wanted man. People unknown to him are tracking him down and trying to capture him. He doesn't know who they are but he knows he must avoid being caught until he knows who he is and why they want him. Assisted by his only confidant Marie (Franka Potente - Blow), a free spirited girl who agrees to drive him to Paris, Jason sets about unravelling the mystery of his past. Will he be happy with what he finds and is there any way he can survive without capture? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a long run of unconvincing spy stories it is refreshing to find a gritty thriller that keeps you guessing. These days most movies do not give the audience credit for intelligence and feel the need to lay the plot on a plate. To its merit, The Bourne Identity does not tell you what is happening but lets you slowly discover it just as the lead character does. It's engaging and the absence of absurd action in favour of realistic car chases and brutal fight sequences gives the movie a real edge over its competition. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Matt Damon gives a strong performance as Jason Bourne balancing the frustration and fragility of an amnesiac with the cold focused confidence of a trained undercover operative. Similarly Franka Potente is entertaining and curiously attractive as the scruffy student type unwillingly dragged into the adventure and peril of Jason's quest to regain his identity. In support, Chris Cooper (Black Hawk Down) convincingly portrays Conklin, a stressed risk taker at the CIA desperate to track down and stop his rogue agent while being pressured by big wig Ward Abbot (Brian Cox - Troy). Meanwhile there is also a near cameo appearance of Julia Stiles(The Prince & Me) as Nicolette, a flustered assistant to Conklin, who works from a small attic space in Paris. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would strongly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Ronin or who enjoyed The Sum Of All Fears. A cerebral spy movie that shines out above the likes of The Recruit.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	49	2011-03-26
51	1	20	\N	Shaun Of The Dead	<p>Following the release of 2003's lame 'Resident Evil', most would agree that the Zombie genre needed a face lift. Earlier this year we, the popcorn munchin' masses, may have been excited at the prospect of a good remake of Dawn of the Dead. Unfortunately that film was as thin as one of its half starved walking dead. Similar to the theme of these films, hope for a future looked bleak. Then Shaun of the Dead arrived at the cinema, a ray of imagination through the murk of movie mogul rehash. It was not the yanks who saved the zombie flick, it was the English comedy writers of BBC's Spaced.</p>  \r\n\r\n<p>Shaun (Simon Pegg) is a no hoper, a near 30 year old waster who works for a small electrical store where he is neglected by absent management and harassed by the younger workers. His girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) is growing tired of Shaun's dead end job and repetitive dull social circle dominated by super slob Ed (Nick Frost).</p> \r\n\r\n<p>As Shaun spends another day dominated by the routine chores of his life he is confronted by two destructive life changing events. Zombies have started to take over the world biting and infecting everything in sight and worse still, Liz has dumped him! In a mission to turn his life round Shaun decides to visit his mum and win back his girlfriend regardless of the walking dead. In a time of crisis a hero will arise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Kate Ashfield as the key cast have a natural chemistry that adds authenticity to the wit and interactions of the characters. The supporting cast are also impressive and includes Dylan Moran (Black Books) as a cynic opposed to Shaun's natural leadership, Bill Nighy (Love Actually) as an aloof stepfather and Penelope Wilton (Calendar Girls) as Shaun's nave and loving Mum.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Shaun of the Dead markets itself as the first Rom-Zom-Com, and is a refreshing change to the past run of dreary zombie flicks. Although the cast and crew have made a fine film, the strength behind this film that raises it above the competition is the quality and creativity of the script. A delicious blend of dry wit and social satire makes Shaun of the Dead a must see.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>This film restores my faith that the British Industry can still make a great comedy. I hope that those across the pond, who occasionally fall victim to irony rather than understand it, realise that there is a market for dark intelligent humour and there is still talent in this small island.</p>\r\n\r\n	4	2011-03-26	51	2011-03-26
53	1	20	\N	Finding Neverland	<p>Last year kids were treated to an exceptional big budget remake of the children's classic play, Peter Pan, starring Jason Isaacs as the intimidating Captain Hook. This year, following the success and interest in children's literature, the adult audience are invited to a glimpse of the real life events that inspired J. M Barrie to write the play about the boy who never grew up. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on true events, Finding Neverland follows the close relationship between the dejected playwright James Barrie (Johnny Depp - Pirates of the Caribbean) and a widow, Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet - Eternal Sunshine) with four sons.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Recovering from the failure of his latest play, James sits in a park with his dog seeking inspiration for a new work and hope for his failing marriage. As he ponders these adult concerns he is distracted by the make believe adventures of a ladies children playing about him. After an introduction James helps over burdened Sylvia to entertain her children. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This simple afternoon in the park is the beginning of what will become a close relationship between the writer, who had his childhood stolen, and the widow whose children may be growing up too fast. As James recaptures his youth and starts work on a new imaginative play, his relationship with his wife (Radha Mitchell - Man on Fire) grows thinner still. Meanwhile Sylvia's interfering mother has her own concerns, rumours are beginning to spread through social circles, something that simply will not do. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnny Depp caught the attention of the Oscar crowd last year when he was nominated for best actor following his role in Pirates of the Caribbean. Depp's portrayal of James Barrie is both touching and lively. Sporting a convincing Scottish accent Depp has to act not only the part of James Barrie, a nervous writer whose marriage and career are on the rocks, but also the various fictitious characters in his imagination. Personally I feel if Depp received another nomination at this year's awards it would be well deserved. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opposite Depp, Kate Winslet returns to her period drama roots after her fun and brilliant performance as Clementine in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. The role of Sylvia is the deepest and most engaging of the primary characters. As she tries to handle the recent loss of her husband, the responsibility of four restless young boys and yet remain graceful and proper in a society that places appearance above all else, we get a true sense of the stresses her character is facing. Sylvia's story, tinged with tragedy, gives Kate Winslet a chance to prove herself in yet another challenging role and is a possible career best. Is this yet another Oscar contender? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In support Julie Christie (Troy) is formidable as Mrs Emma du Maurier, Sylvia's mother, giving a sense of forbidding menace in her various confrontations with both the children and James Barrie. Similarly Radha Mitchell is both beautiful yet cold as Mary, the wife of James Barrie, who grows detached from the writer she loves. However the most impressive spectacle must surely be young Freddie Highmore (Five Children & It) as Peter, one of Sylvia's children, and a cynic of both childish behaviour and the interloper, Barrie. Taking into consideration that he is only twelve years old, Freddie's portrayal of a grieving child is excellent and steals the final scenes from his peers. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>Finding Neverland is both very human and touching yet retains elements of the magic that ultimately created the world of Peter Pan. Director Marc Forster (Monsters Ball) has made a wonderful film and has definitely managed to get the best of his actors and the most out of a simple yet emotional story. As I left the cinema there was many a wet eye and praise for the movie and I am sure that when it comes round to Oscar season this film will not leave the ceremonies empty handed. For anyone who enjoyed Big Fish, you'll really enjoy this movie.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	53	2011-03-26
56	1	20	\N	Shark Tale	<p>Oscar (Will Smith - I, Robot) is a small fish in a big ocean and he aspires to be more than he is. Working as a tongue scrubber at a whale wash, Oscar is care free and more than a little vain as he toys with co-workers and concocts ever more stupid schemes to make him enough cash to move up in the world. At his side is loyal friend Angie (Renee Zellwegger - Cold Mountain) who'll do anything to help him even if she cannot understand his desire for fame.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile the local head of organised crime, shark mob boss Don Lino (Robert De Niro - Godsend) is facing a family dilemma. He hopes to retire and pass his business on to his two loving sons. Unfortunately while one son, Frankie, is a ravenous carnivore, his second son Larry (Jack Black - School of Rock) is...well...different. Larry is a pacifist and although he loves his father he feels he is letting him down with his lack of shark-like cravings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fairly soon fate puts Larry and Oscar together. As Frankie tries to teach Larry how to get in touch with his ferocious side by chasing Oscar through the sea, he is struck down by a falling anchor. Confused onlookers soon believe that Oscar, the small fish, has slayed a shark. As the story spreads through the reef, Oscar does little to broadcast the truth as his sudden fame brings him the wealth and success he has been craving.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>However Oscar's happy dreams soon turn into a nightmare when Larry arrives seeking sanctuary. The playful shark who needs a home and knows the truth behind Oscar's success could ruin everything. To compound problems, Don Lino is enraged at the death of his son and is out for revenge against the shark slayer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What follows is a fun filled family comedy full of clichs and satire to keep both kids and adults entertained. As with the Shrek movies there are lots of small movie references and the world we know is recreated as a reef. Billboards advertise Coral Cola and sushi salesmen are more than a little frustrated. There are traffic jams, paparazzi and crazy hermits living in trash cans.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Following the awesome success of Shrek 2 earlier this year, Dreamworks have made another great animation hit. The characterisation is great and the facial features of the various fish are very reminiscent of the actors behind the vocal talent. The animation is crisp and inventive and is significantly different from 2003's Finding Nemo to avoid comparison. The story, although a little slow at first, soon picks up pace and keeps the movie swimming along until the final reel. All in all a great popcorn hit.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	56	2011-03-26
57	1	20	\N	Sky Captain and the World Of Tomorrow	\r\n<P>Imagine walking down the street of 1940's New York and witnessing the arrival of monstrous flying robots that stand over two hundred feet tall that fire beams of light from their eyes destroying anyone who opposes them. No, this is not War of the Worlds, that's next year, this is Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, one of the most refreshing movies of the autumn season. </p>\r\n\r\n<P>Filmed entirely against blue screen with a fanciful storyline, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow was a brave pitch for the relatively unknown writer/director Kerry Conran yet one that caught the imagination of the studios and has finally been realised on the big screen. </p>\r\n\r\n<P>Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow - Sylvia) is a confident and ambitious journalist investigating the mysterious disappearance of some world famous scientists. Her enquiries are hampered by the arrival of menacing robots and the reappearance of her former boyfriend, the brave mercenary fighter pilot known only as 'Sky Captain' (Jude Law - Cold Mountain). </p>\r\n\r\n<P>As strongly as Polly wants to unravel the mystery of the disappearing scientists and get her story, the Sky Captain wants to trace the origin of the robots and stop the series of terror attacks plaguing the world. Reluctantly forming a union, Polly and the Sky Captain set off on a thrilling adventure that will take them through the skies and over the Himalayas, to the bottom of the sea and inside a volcano. </p>\r\n\r\n<P>As mentioned earlier, this entire movie was filmed against blue screen, something that must have posed a great challenge for the principle cast. Luckily the tight script and some good humour gave the actors a great opportunity to work off one another rather than the absent settings and the result is some great comedy. Jude Law is engaging and entertaining as the fearless hero daring to challenge the elements, the skies and a number of menacing robot baddies. However Gwyneth Paltrow is delicious as Polly Perkins, a character with an acid tongue and fierce independence similar to Lois Lane yet definitely more stylish. </p>\r\n\r\n<P>The ever-present special effects are highly stylised and give this film a fresh image compared to the other fantastical stories seen this year. A neutral colour pallet and an attention to camera work and imagery realistically create an art-deco world besieged by machines from an unknown enemy. Indeed fans of science fiction may find the movie's style reminiscent of Fitz Lang's 1927 silent masterpiece Metropolis, arguably the first great science fiction movie, while the story also appears to borrow heavily from the 1936 masterpiece 'Things to Come'. </p>\r\n\r\n<P>All in all, Sky Captain is a great break from the norm and if not overly original in story or style it deserves great credit for being one of the first movies filmed entirely against blue screen. The principle leads are wonderful, the effects are inspiring and the British sense of humour ever present in the script should keep many chuckling as the adventure unfolds. Keep an eye out for the curious casting choice for the big baddie and also pay attention for the best final line in a film, I think, since Patriot Games.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	57	2011-03-26
59	1	12	\N	Infernal Affairs 2	<p>It's a truism that successful films usually spawn inferior progeny, but every so often a genuinely good sequel comes along that lives up to their parent, or even surpasses it. Unfortunately "Infernal Affairs 2" falls squarely into the majority category (though it's actually a prequel), which accentuates the disappointment felt given that its predecessor was such a breath of fresh air in the Hong Kong movie genre. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>"Infernal Affairs" was successful because it kept things simple. It eschewed the Hong Kong movie cliches of a three-figure bodycount and wire-fu in favour of a tense thriller that centred around a neat premise and the excellent performances of its four main stars. Yan, a cop who has been deep undercover with the Triads for a decade, wants to regain his real identity but when the Triads discover his existence, he is pitted in a desperate battle of wits against the Triads's own mole in the police force, Ming. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rewind ten years. Infernal Affairs 2 is a prequel, detailing Ming's rise within the police force and Yan's life amongst the Triads. When the Triad boss Kwun Ngai is assassinated, a bloody war for succession is skilfully avoided by his son, Hau, who quickly secures his position by blackmail and manipulation. When Hau informs all of his siblings of their father's death, he police discover Kwan Ngai was Yan's father and give Yan a brutal choice: work undercover in the Triads or leave the police force in disgrace. Meanwhile, Ming has just started out as one of Sam's moles in the police force, but his loyalty is called into question when he falls in love with Sam's wife. Beneath everything, Hau plots his vengeance against his father's killers. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The short version is that "Infernal Affairs 2" takes everything that was good about Infernal Affairs and summarily bins the lot, with the notable exceptions of Anthony Wong and Eric Tsang who reprise their roles as Superintendent Wong and Sam respectively. However, even with good performances and slightly meatier roles, the two just aren't enough to save the film from being a diabolical mess. This is all the more surprising since the original writers and directors were on board for this follow-up. If one discounts the knee-jerk reaction that "Infernal Affairs" was a film that didn't need a sequel nor a prequel, attention is soon drawn to the shoddy plot. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since this is a prequel, one knows what the status quo will be by the end of the film so the trick is to keep the proceedings interesting. At the start, I made the reasonable assumption that any new characters introduced wouldn't survive and I wasn't surprised in the slightest. There are a couple of twists in place to keep viewers on their toes, but only one is successful. The other undermines the credibility of a key character in both films so badly that I honestly can't imagine what the writers were thinking of. To say any more would be a spoiler, but it is a shocking revelation. What is possibly more distressing is the lack of consequence when this revelation comes to light, it's just swept under the carpet as if nothing happened which defies belief. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to these additional characters, the film is more of an ensemble piece than the original and seems to aspire to being a Triad version of the Godfather, unsuccessfully I might add. As a result, Ming and Yan have less screen-time than before. This isn't such a bad thing as Edison Chen and Shawn Yue, who play Ming and Yan, don't even come close to matching the screen presence of their predecessors Andy Lau and Tony Leung. They give the appearance of having been borrowed from a Canto-pop boy-band, and accordingly spend the entire film looking sullen as if their usual pampering has been replaced by these two directors shouting at them for being unable to act their way out of a paper bag. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As expected, Anthony Wong and Eric Tsang put in excellent performances but other than that, there is very little indeed to recommend about Infernal Affairs 2.

By following Fiona's every command, Sam knows it is her only hope of funding her way to Princeton University if she gets offered a place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, at school Sam has embarked on a secret internet and text romance with a fellow Princeton hopeful and her best friend Carter (Dan Byrd - The Grue Crew) convinces her to meet up with her mystery man.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Princeton pair arrange to meet at the school Halloween party where Sam discovers that her secret love is the high school hunk Austin (Chad Michael Murray - Freaky Friday) who has never given her the time of day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Sam decides to keep her identity secret and when she rushes off to meet her midnight curfew, she drops her mobile phone.  So instead of the glass slipper, her Prince Charming leaps on the challenge to find the owner of the mobile phone and to discover the identity of the girl behind the mask.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a relative newcomer to the Hollywood big screen but a dab hand on the US TV scene, Hilary Duff puts in a great performance as the sweet and innocent Cinderella in this modern remake.  Chad Michael Murray, most notable for his bad boy antics in US teen drama Dawson's Creek, plays a sexy and mysterious Prince Charming while Dan Byrd provides the comedic value as the geeky underdog that everyone loves!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Cinderella Story is really entertaining and perfect for its teenage girl target audience, as well as older girls who love chick flicks and those who have a soft spot for soppy romances.  Watch it if you liked Ever After with Drew Barrymore.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	60	2011-03-26
61	1	15	\N	Alien Vs Predator	<p>Monster showdowns have been a staple of movies ever since the moment a giant plasticine Tyrannosaurus Rex stumbled out of the forest and took on his fellow stop motion Brachiosaur in a fight to the death. Now the two heavy weight creatures of science fiction, the Alien from Ridley Scott's classic 1979 horror film and the Predator from John McTiernan's blood soaked 1987 action flick, have been brought face to face in the hands of director Paul W. S. Anderson (Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil). I was afraid and for all the wrong reasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alien can proudly claim to be at the peak of both the horror and science fiction genres while Predator has its own peculiar charm and is one of Arnold Swarzenegger's best films. However when the head of an Alien appeared on the Predator's trophy wall at the climax of Predator 2 a marketing opportunity that couldn't be missed was set in motion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Set in the present day rather than the futuristic timeline of Alien, a group of scientists investigating a pyramid buried beneath the Antarctic ice become the unwitting bait of a group of Predators who are hunting the rapidly breeding Aliens within the ever shifting walls of the ancient monument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While not a disaster, all the film can really claim is that it doesn't manage to disgrace either franchise. However failing to do anything remotely interesting with its premise is hardly a basis for success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The movie suffers from an almost complete lack of originality. Heroine Alexa Woods (Sanaa Lathan - Out of Time) is nothing more than a half baked Ripley clone with none of Sigourney Weaver's screen presence and the film makers prefer to copy classic moments from its six predecessors and pass them off as nostalgic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The anonymous cast seem to have been delivered to the set in boxes marked 'disposable meat.' Half are chopped to pieces by muscle bound Predators, half are crazy glued to the wall to act as incubators for squirming Aliens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recognisable faces such as Colin Salmon (Die Another Day) and Ewen Bremner (Trainspotting) are given very little to do and fail to rise above the crowd thanks to sketchy characterisation and poor dialogue.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The only credible performance comes from franchise veteran Lance Henriksen as industrialist Charles Bishop Weyland, the apparent template for the future android Bishop who appears in both Aliens and Alien 3. Unfortunately, every time Henriksen appears it is impossible not to wish that it was the film's superior predecessors up on the screen and not this uninspired sequel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film's target audience however probably don't care that much about characterisation, they will come to see the two creatures duke it out. Sadly the extraterrestrial fightclub scenes are a little thin on the ground. With the exception of the first bone crunching one on one and the frenetic finale between a sprightly Predator and an Alien Queen on speed, the two sets of monsters spend most of their time picking on the human supporting cast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the positive side, computer effects are now advanced enough to allow the Aliens to leap around realistically like nightmarish cougars and the impressively vast and detailed sets provide an interesting backdrop for the tame action to take place upon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once again Anderson provides an ending that demands a sequel, raising the question why the director feels he always has to secure his own future work? Reports that the next installment will be entitled Alien Vs Predator Vs Alf have so far gone unconfirmed.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	61	2011-03-26

Stemming from an ill advised prank on a friend and deep psychological memories from his childhood and that of his parents troubled marriage, this film descends quickly into an alarming farce. \r\n</p><p>\r\nPoor acting, poor set, poor clothing. This film fails at the simple basics that it has nothing to build upon. A basic story with potential but does not translate to the screen. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThis may be a low budget, English movie, but this is no excuse for poor acting and an extremely poor script.\r\n</p><p>\r\nClose to hospitalising myself and my friend, I was stunned to see that the audience applauded at the end, even sitting quietly and watching the closing credits. Why? Was this the British politeness and art of queuing I had witnessed?

15	1	20	Blah	The Chronicles of Riddick	<p>In a galaxy filled with CGI space ships, a race of shoulder pad sporting megalomaniacs, the Necromongers, are slowly taking over every planet in sight. Leading this pack of excessively armoured morons is the infamous Lord Marshal (Colm Feore - Paycheck) who has powers beyond all other men. Second in command is the ever frowning Vaako (Karl Urban - The Bourne Supremacy) who is under the thumb of his power crazed wife Dame Vaako (Thandie Newton - Mission Impossible 2) who dreams of the day her husband will succeed the Lord Marshal. Can nothing stop these power obsessed fashion victims?</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Sequel to the unexpected hit Pitch Black, the Chronicles of Riddick is an ambitious follow up that aims to explore the character of Riddick as he tries to save the universe from a seemingly invincible Necormongers. Apart from the occasional reference to its predecessor, the Chronicles of Riddick is a stand alone film and should not really be considered a sequel, rather a sister story that includes some of the original characters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I always try to find merit in a movie but this film proved to be a challenge. It has lots of action as you would expect for a Vin Diesel movie, but alas the fighting is far fetched, often unecessary and contrived. Similarly the film had bucket loads of special effects albeit, excessive and non essential. Finally, the movie has the basis for a good story, however this was quite thin and has been seen in similar forms before. All in all, despite some good ingredients this movie falls flat on its face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I watched the film I was reminded a little of David Lynch's 'Dune' with its large impressively decorated spacecraft and massive legions of heavily armoured drones. Similarly the evil Necromongers (boo hiss) were a little reminiscent of Star Trek's evil race 'The Borg' who assimilate all in their path to further swell their forces. These unoriginal components have been poorly bolted together with a disappointing script and thin characters.</p>  \r\n\r\n<P>Adding to the problem and harking back to science fiction movie history, many remember with a shudder the awful voice over narrative that polluted the cinematic version of Blade Runner. The Chronicles of Riddick sports a very similar droning narration that does little to add to the story and only adds to the tacky feel of the film.</P>\r\n\r\n<P>In the lead role of Riddick, Vin Diesel (XXX) was necessary casting and despite good performances in earlier movies, his sole purpose in this film seemed to be to flex his sizable pecks and strut around large set pieces like a blunt weapon. This is either inspired acting or a weak character, let the voting commence. Meanwhile the big bad dude, the lord marshal, is only present for a such short space of time that he poses no real menace. Instead his monobrow henchman, Vaako (Karl Urban) gets the greater amount of screen time but spends the majority of the film bickering with his wife while trying to simultaneously defeat Riddick and usurp power. Neither of which do we ever believe he is capable of doing, let alone delivering his lines in any emotive or engaging form. Even the bright and beautiful Dame Judi Dench (Die Another Day) cannot save this film. Her angelic performance as Aereon, faultless as ever, outshines all the remaining cast combined and although her performance shines brightly, she cannot save this steaming pile.</P>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite my best efforts I cannot grant this film anything more than one star. It's a mess of a movie and needs a lot of editing and reworking if it ever hopes to compete with the science fiction blockbusters already screening this year. Its possible this film was too ambitious for what in essence is an action man movie. It went too far in one film and instead of inspiring the audience it became pretentious and comical. There are rumours of a sequel and I hope they are unfounded.</p>	1	2011-03-26	5	2012-03-08
19	1	20	Blah	The Punisher	<p>Over the last few years there have been a whole host of comic book adaptations and recently some big studios are adapting some of the more obscure comic strip characters such as Hellboy and Sin City. Do not let this lead you into believing that all the best and most popular characters have been made already, No! Indeed there are some heavy weight comic book classic characters still awaiting adaptation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a kid I was never really that into comic books (nerdy), I was more into Lego and a good chemistry set (even nerdier). When it came to superheroes my favourite was always Batman, firstly because he had the best villains (the joker is crazy cool) but more importantly because he did not actually have any unbelievable special powers. He wasn't an alien or a mutant. He wasn't possessed or changed by some strange radiation exposure. He was just a wealthy man who used his money to build great gadgets to help him fight crime. Of course Batman is far fetched but at the end of the day it is semi plausible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now if Batman was semi plausible, The Punisher is very plausible. The basic background is that a Special Forces soldier, John Castle, returns from Vietnam to find his family killed by crooks. Filled with vengeance he becomes an unrelenting vigilante taking on crime with a zero tolerance attitude. That story is more than plausible, indeed as the police find their hands tied and crime rates soar it is probably a reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Punisher comics are a phenomenon and have a huge following. With this popularity, you may ask why the movie studios haven't made an adaptation. The thing is, they already have. Way back in 1989 the acting genius that is Dolph Lundgren (Universal Soldier) made a terrible movie adaptation of the comic. That film was naff and left a bad smell on the franchise that probably repelled some studios. In addition the plausibility of the simple premise behind The Punisher has been seen in countless action movies and thrillers for a number of years ('Death Wish' and 'Enter the Dragon' to name but two). Indeed the premise is the formulaic backbone behind most action movies, which is why the studios went to the comics in the first place, to find characters more far-fetched and charismatic that may revive the stagnant action genre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily after years on the shelf Hollywood has dusted off The Punisher and given the character a new breath of life. With a minor tweak to the original comic character, John Castle (Thomas Jane - Dreamcatcher) is no longer a war veteran but an ex soldier and undercover agent for the FBI. During his last mission for the FBI, Castle is involved in a bungled arms deal sting that results in the death of one of the crooks. Unknown to Castle, the dead crook is the son of vicious mob leader Howard Saint (John Travolta - Basic). Hearing news of his son's death, Howard orders the death of Frank Castle and his family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mob is merciless and arriving at a Castle family reunion they murder the entire gene pool. Last of all they go after Frank Castle and after shooting him repeatedly and beating him to a pulp, they leave him to die on a burning jetty. As you can guess, Frank doesn't die. Instead he vows revenge on Howard Saint and the mob.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tom Jane is impressive in the lead role as Frank Castle. Not only does he have the physique of an action hero but he also manages to put across on screen a definite coldness of character yet also delivers some good comedy along the way. The script doesn't provide a lot of dialogue for the lead role yet the few words that are spoken are put across in a quiet, short and confident fashion that add to the coldness of the character. Turning now to the bad guys, John Travolta is on good form as the nemesis and eventual target of Castle. A man who has spent years confident of his position at the top of the food chain who sees his world and power start to crumble.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In support of the good guy, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (X2) sheds her blue skin from the X-Men movies to play a lonely but optimistic girl who hopes to melt the heart of the grieving vigilante. With only a limited amount of dialogue but great beauty, Rebecca lights up the screen in her few scenes. In support of the bad guy, Will Patton gets an opportunity to sport a handlebar moustache as the head henchman and close friend of Howard Saint who hides a secret sin that may be his ultimate undoing. Also Laura Harring does well to combine cold sadistic malice and sex appeal as Howard Saint's ever faithful and unforgiving wife.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Punisher is a great action movie, unpretentious and direct. For the ladies there are a fair number of rippling chests and romantic reveries to keep you entertained while for the lads there are plenty of gunfights, explosions and violent confrontations to keep your blood racing. If you are a fan of the Die Hard movies, Dirty Harry or just generally like a shoot 'em up movie, The Punisher is a must see.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	19	2012-03-08

63	1	15	\N	In Good Company	<p>Dan Foreman (Dennis Quaid - The Day After Tomorrow) is a contented advertising salesman for a leading sports magazine. The only worry on his horizon is that his demanding job often forces him to miss out on the everyday family life that he holds so dear. Little does Dan realise that his entire world is about to be thrown into disorder thanks to a succession of unexpected problems that a man who is about to hit the seasoned age of 51 thought were far behind him. Now with a new baby on the way and an eldest daughter's expensive college education to pay for, Dan finds his career is in the hands of Carter Duryea (Topher Grace - TV's That 70's Show), a 26 year old executive who makes Dan look like a dinosaur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Director Paul Weitz's last project, <i>About a Boy</i>, was both a popular and critical success. Weitz now looks like staging a repeat performance with his latest film, In Good Company. Like About a Boy this comedy drama follows the story of a male central character that is going through life without forming any meaningful relationships with those around him. Replacing Hugh Grant's slightly unsympathetic social recluse is Topher Grace's slightly unsympathetic salesman whose growing success at work is matched only by a rapidly failing family life back at his stylish but cold home. While Grant's character was self centred, salesman Grace's world solely revolves around his job because he has nothing else of importance to occupy his time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Promotional material advertising the film as a romantic comedy is a little wide of the mark. Scarlett Johansson (Lost in Translation) drifts in and out of the film as Quaid's eldest daughter, Alex. For once her usually radiant performance fails to materialise and her presence on screen doesn't demand the audience's attention. In fact Alex's liaisons with Carter are unfortunate distractions from the film's principle relationship, the one between Quaid's easy going old timer and Topher's highly strung youth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A witty script and engaging performances make this film well worth watching although the failure to produce a truly involving climax proves to be a serious flaw. For a film essentially about the impersonal nature of modern business and the global community, the leading characters never fully connect to form the friendship that you hope and expect them to. While Carter clearly envies much of Dan's life and grows to respect his 'old fashioned' way of doing business, Dan merely seems to tolerate his boss's presence in the office as an unavoidable evil, while outside work his family life is too important to him to be diluted by the potential friendship of a lonely young man.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless Quaid provides a reliably gruff performance as the lone straight talking salesman in a sea of corporate bullshit. The scene where he interrupts billionaire boss Malcolm McDowell's babbling speech of buzz words is a great moment for the little guy. Meanwhile Topher Grace shows he has the talent to break out of his television role and make it big in film.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	63	2011-03-26
64	1	15	\N	Exorcist: The Beginning	<p>Few films could have survived the tortured production history that Exorcist: The Beginning has withstood. Original director Paul Schrader had practically completed his version of the film when he was released by studio executives who were unhappy with the low levels of gore in the movie. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Director Renny Harlin (Cutthroat Island) was hired as Schrader's replacement and he set about reshooting an almost entirely new movie from a rewritten script. Characters from Schrader's version were dropped while new parts were included. The film was now over budget and behind schedule, a fact which meant that one actor had to leave the production to work on his next project forcing his part to be recast. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Unsurprisingly these behind the scenes challenges have left visible scars up on the screen. The film is more of a mess than a volley of green projectile vomit.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Seemingly undecided as whether to embrace the crowd pleasing guts and gore of today's mainstream horror or attempt to recreate the creepy psychological atmosphere that was the hallmark of William Friedkin's classic original, the film lurches between extremes, failing at both.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Basing its premise on an apparent prior meeting between Father Merrin and the possessing demon Pazuzu, the film is set in 1949 British colonial Kenya where an archaeological dig of a buried Christian church is beset by supernatural problems.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The usually excellent Stellan Skarsgard (Ronin) stars as a younger Lancaster Merrin, a man who has lost his faith after witnessing the horror of the Second World War at close range. Now a broken man, he has been hired to investigate the church and recover a demonic idol. Sadly Skarsgard has a resigned look on his face throughout the film as if well aware that the entire enterprise is a quickly sinking ship. Max von Sydow radiates more charisma during his short appearance as Father Merrin in the 1973 original than Skarsgard and the entire cast of Exorcist: The Beginning can muster in its nearly two hour running time.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>As the dig is beset by such plagues as boils and flies I couldn't help but wish that the gratuitous bloodletting could be skipped so we could reach the scenes of possession and inevitable exorcism. Only a horrific hyena attack is both suitably unpleasant and unnerving. After withstanding an hour and a half of ideas being introduced then ignored, characters abandoned and a gush of unconnected gore the exorcism finally arrived to a fanfare of crushing disappointment. Clearly thirty years of parody has meant that spinning your head around 360 degrees and talking with a deep voice isn't nearly as frightening as it used to be.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps a coherent plot and some more vigorous editing could have salvaged a reasonable film from this quagmire but unforgivably for a film that has Exorcist in the title, Tubular Bells isn't heard once during the entire film and as a result will never earn more than two stars. A mooted release of Paul Schrader's film on DVD may offer a more promising version but Renny Harlin's movie should be avoided by all but the most hardened of devil worshippers.</p>	2	2011-03-26	64	2011-03-26

And at the same time, Mr Balraj's old college friend Will Darcy (Martin Henderson - The Ring) has set his sights on Lalita.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Jaya and Lalita are invited to join Mr Balraj and his friends in Goa, the Bakshis jump at the invitation.  As Lalita and Mr Darcy spend more and more time together they realise they are from completely different worlds.  And soon enough Lalita has turned her attention to English traveller and Darcy's arch enemy Mr Wickham (Daniel Gillies - Spider-Man 2).</p>  \r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Lalita's mother has lined up an eligible Indian bachelor for her daughter but Lalita is struggling to choose between her true affections for Mr Darcy and Mr Wickham.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bride and Prejudice is full of rich colours, beautiful scenery and plenty of song-filled dance routines.  In fact, the actors seem to burst into song in almost every scene!</p>  \r\n\r\n<p>Don't miss the hilarious, yet sinister, snake dance and the cringeworthy, yet entertaining, lyrics in the musical scenes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are looking for a film that doesn't take itself seriously or a soppy romantic love story then look no further.

67	1	20	\N	Alexander	<p>Young Alexander became king of Macedonia at the early age of twenty and inherited a country at war with the superior Persian Empire. Despite his youth Alexander, outnumbered, claimed victory over the Persians and made Babylon his home. He then spent years expanding his empire into Asia at a time when the East was an unknown region full of peril. This is a true story, hence the desire of many a director to make a film about one of histories most inspired, if poorly understood, leaders.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Oliver Stone, veteran movie director, always puts a massive effort into every project and has often been outspoken. With Alexander he faced a challenge, how to sum up the life of the great man in one film.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Ask yourself what was Alexander the Great famous for? Was it his undisputed tactical genius, his determination, the fact that he built the first real roads into the East and founded some of the world's greatest ancient cities, or that he had love life issues and an overbearing mother?</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Considering this film was over three hours long it felt like the film dwelled too much on the personal love life of Alexander and his family issues rather than what he achieved as a leader and his historic legacy. This film purports to tell the story of the greatest commander in history, yet seemed strangely reminiscent of a protracted episode of Eastenders albeit with more lavish sets and the odd gargantuan battle.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>In fairness the film can boast a more accurate representation than any previous screen incarnation of Alexander and the narrative covers all the known achievements of the great man even if only a few are shown. The film has a good introduction showing the childhood of Alexander and his idolisation of characters from Greek mythology, especially Achilles, a hero who sought eternal glory by battle rather than stable conformist anonymity. This desire to surpass the achievements of the past seemingly determines the course of Alexander's life.\r\nAs well as a childhood introduction the film also spends time on some of the more decisive battles allowing a brief demonstration of Alexander's tactical brilliance. Nevertheless, it still seemed to linger on his on-off relationship with boyfriend Hephaiston, his troubled marriage, and an ever repeating cycle of betrayal and retribution that soon becomes tiresome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>True, I can entertain arguments that a man's family and his choice of friends and lovers may be a key to his personality, yet with Alexander the Great's fantastic achievements, to leave all but a few aside to focus on the kitchen sink drama seemed such a waste. Where was the founding of Alexandria, the visit to the Oracle of Amon or the destruction of Thebes?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before I get too negative, this film has many good points. The cinematography was excellent with use of different filming techniques to add that extra element to each scene. The use of filters to add visual effect to certain scenes, the inspiring Vangelis soundtrack, and the portrayal of the decisive battle at Gaugamela against the Persians surpasses anything seen in Troy or even Lord of the Rings all boost this film's technical merit. Similarly the art work and sets for Babylon, Alexandria, and the various other palaces and villages through the film were rich and detailed adding yet more sincerity. However all this fine attention can be easily undone and I regret to say in this instance there were a fair few irritations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Colin Farrell (SWAT) in the lead role as adolescent and full grown Alexander gave a solid stab at being the great hero but unlike his attack on the Persians, he lost the battle to budge the Irish accent very early on in the film. Seemingly in sympathy the rest of the cast took up various accents to try and make some conformity. Even Val Kilmer managed to sound Irish despite being an American playing a Greek king. I also detected on occasion a Cornish tone or two, the odd suggestion of the strong Yorkshire accent and at least a few Scots. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The acting all in all was pass with most scenes either so gentle as to be whispered or loud confrontations filled with proclamations or heated arguments. The relentless intense confrontations between Alexander and almost every other cast member became tiresome and some good acting may have been lost in the tragic overacting and ever present Irish twang. Anthony Hopkins (Red Dragon) gave an expected boost to proceedings with the narrative of Ptolemy while surprisingly one of the best performances was provided by Angelina Jolie (Tomb Raider 2) as Alexander's manipulative yet menacing mother, Olympias.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it is evident already, I was a little disappointed by Alexander. The ingredients were all there for a truly impressive epic yet it felt weak and patchy. The visual brilliance was ever present. Some the scenes were fantastic, yet on the whole it just felt a little lost. Maybe the story itself was just too big, and by trying to cram in episodes of a great saga the theme was lost along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have a passing interest in history and Alexander the Great is one of the blank spots so I was hoping for some insight but found little. The man provided the simple solution to the Gordian knot has been replaced instead by a warrior pretty boy with a desire to earn immortal fame and build a lasting empire if he can only keep his army on his side. My brother, a more blunt critic than I, summed the film up in a few choice words:</p> \r\n\r\n<p><b>"Gay Irishmen on horseback take over Asia"</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are going to see it, see it at a cinema. The landscapes, battles and sets demand that in the least but do not expect a film to surpass Gladiator, even if it is a little more sincere than last year's Troy.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	67	2011-03-26
68	1	15	\N	Alfie	<p>What's it all about? Never has a tagline better summed up the film it was designed to promote. To the best of my knowledge Jude Law's remake of the 1966 Michael Caine classic Alfie has absolutely no point to it at all. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Law stars as the eponymous ladies man Alfie who uses his trade as a New York limousine driver to seduce a plethora of stunners while treating the audience to his theories about life and relationships. The problem is that our self centred anti hero is clearly spouting rubbish and the audience know it. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alfie puts the moves on a succession of women only to inevitably screw up their lives in some way while enthusing about his fake playboy lifestyle. Excruciatingly slowly Alfie begins to realise that his existence is little more than a shallow and repetitive fantasy. Just like the film. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the receiving end of Alfie's dubious patter are Marisa Tomei (Anger Management), Susan Sarandon (The Banger Sisters), Sienna Miller (Layer Cake), Jane Krakowski (Ice Age) and Nia Long (Big Momma's House). Having so many love interests however only further emphasises the episodic nature of the script although all five actresses put in good performances. Long in particular, who has the most material to work with, manages to make her stage of the film the most involving. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the leading role, Jude Law is suitably charming although the fact that he appears to be receiving sponsorship from Benson and Hedges and Colgate Extra Whitening toothpaste quickly becomes distracting. He looks stylish throughout, as do his female companions and New York surroundings but a little more substance to the film would have been welcome. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the third Michael Caine remake in recent years following on from the appalling Get Carter and the mediocre Italian Job. Following this latest disappointment one can only hope that Hollywood leaves the rest well alone, after all, it would be difficult to translate Zulu to modern day New York.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	68	2011-03-26
69	1	15	\N	Resident Evil Apocalypse	<p>Perhaps the least anticipated sequel since Wishmaster 4 crash landed on a video shelf near you, Resident Evil Apocalypse proves to be the kind of inept and pointless waste of time that I couldn't help but suspect it would be.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>After a not particularly quick recap of what happened in the first film we discover that the infected underground lab, known as the Hive, that was sealed up at the end of the last movie has a handy entrance within the limits of Racoon City. No sooner than you can say 'Oops' the Umbrella Corporation, creators of the deadly T-Virus, has cracked open the doors and spread the zombie plague to the unfortunate residents of the city.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Elsewhere, Alice (Milla Jovovich - The Fifth Element) wakes up in an abandoned hospital and soon links up with a band of survivors led by gun wielding super cop Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory - The Time Machine). This happy band then wanders around town being chased by badly animated computer effects as they try to find a lost little girl who is important for some reason or other.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>It could be argued that Shaun of the Dead has ruined the serious zombie horror genre for the time being but the makers of this film have no excuse in producing this half-hearted nonsense. When your principle monster is a leather skirt wearing muppet reject that is slightly less threatening than the Stay-Puft ?? Marshmallow man you know your horror film is in trouble.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Each action sequence begins with the same slow motion arrival of one of the heroes, preferably firing their guns, followed immediately by indecipherable speeded up violence.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Frequently the film makes very little sense. Massed ranks of heavily armed police are busy gunning down zombies but only decide to retreat once they have been overwhelmed and are busy being munched on by slow moving extras in minimal make up. Why, when the dead are rising all over the city, do the principal characters stop to have a chat in, of all places, a cemetery?</p>\r\n \r\n<p>How does the Umbrella Corporation make any money? Apparently the world's largest company, all they seem to do is produce products that kill their customers.  How is nuking an entire city going to look on their company accounts?</p>\r\n \r\n<p>More importantly, if I was off out for a night of zombie fighting I would wear some comfortable trainers because I would probably have to do some running and would bring a jumper in case it got cold. The heroines however prefer high heels, skin tight vest tops, short skirts and tiny shorts for their death defying antics. Perhaps dressing slutty gives the ladies an advantage over the undead that I am unaware of?</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The only terrifying aspect of the film is a pointless ten minute ending that is tacked on to set the stage for a sequel we can only pray is never made.</p>\r\n	1	2011-03-26	69	2011-03-26
70	1	15	\N	Stealth	<p>Elite American fighter pilots Ben Gannon, Kara Wade and Henry Purcell are a close knit fighting trio who specialise in flying around at really, really high speeds in pointy planes dropping bombs on third world terrorists packing deadly AK-47's. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>As good as they think they are, however, corner cutting Captain George Cummings (Sam Shepard - Black Hawk Down) thinks they can be better so introduces EDI, the latest generation of Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles. EDI talks in a quiet pleasant voice, which means he is a ruthless killer at heart, and like his new wingmen, is about as stealthy as an avalanche. He also looks a lot like a flying cowpat. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team aren't too pleased with being saddled with a beach ball that has more brains than the three of them put together and inform their boss that this will all end in disaster at which point EDI is struck by lightning and decides that he doesn't want to die but can't get enough of blowing other people up. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Yes, you've guessed it, Stealth is big, loud and very, very stupid. There is entertainment value to be had laughing at the awkward attempts at characterisation and the very dodgy world view the film makers clearly believe they live in. Unfortunately this movie isn't supposed to be a comedy so I'm not awarding marks for making the film a joke. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jamie Foxx (Collateral) is cast in the role of expendable black sidekick Henry. During his brief screen time he is the victim of some of the most racist stereotyping ever witnessed in modern cinema. Foxx's role boils down to nothing more than womanising comic relief. Sure, he is also one of the three best pilots the US Navy has to offer, but he can't avoid 4,000m high mountain peaks so perhaps now we know how he got cast as Ray Charles. </p>\r\n<p>Josh Lucas (Wonderland) has a cold mechanical demeanour as Ben who screams out sadistic villain but the casting director decided the all American action hero role was tailor made for him. The robotic plane has more charisma and I know who I wanted to come out top in their dog fight. His character also has to spout some absolutely ridiculous speeches about how terrible war is and that by introducing robots people might treat violence like some kind of computer game and forget that real people are dying. Cut to an extended sequence strangely reminiscent of a computer game where the hero blows the crap out of something without even a frown crossing his brow. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>By the end of the movie our trio of heroes and EDI have managed to start at least three conflicts, killed thousands and plunged the world into war. Apparently irradiating the Pakistani border, invading Russian airspace and destroying three of their fighter jets, not to mention breaking a fifty year ceasefire with North Korea has no consequences as long as they were done to save a girl with pert breasts (Jessica Biel - Blade Trinity). I can't wait to hear the US President's phone call to the aggrieved leaders of the nations involved. "Really sorry about all the folks we've killed, but you see there was this robot plane and...um." </p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is it with killer robots by the way? Surely someone must have realised that the only good robots ever made were R2-D2 and Johnny 5. The rest's only aim seems to be the complete and utter destruction of mankind. Why exactly a fighter jet would need artificial intelligence to evolve when its sole purpose is to blow stuff up and follow orders is too big a mystery for the average Stealth audience to solve by themselves. Another important mystery that needs to be solved is why this film was ever made.</p>\r\n	1	2011-03-26	70	2011-03-26
71	1	20	\N	National Treasure	<p>A young boy named Ben Gates sits with his aged grandfather and listens to a fantastical tale of a massive hoard of treasure. The fantastic collection of art, gems and gold was hidden by the founding fathers to protect it from the English during the earliest days of the fledgling United States. The boy is further amazed to hear that the only clue to the whereabouts of the treasure was a cryptic message handed in secret to his family so many generations ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<P>The story captures the imagination of young Ben who agrees to follow the family tradition and seek out the treasure, much to the annoyance of his father, the one weak branch in the family tree.</P>\r\n\r\n<p>National Treasure starts with the fully grown Ben (Nicholas Cage) traveling into a frozen waste with his financier Ian (Sean Bean) and young techy sidekick Riley, in search of the first solid clue to the whereabouts of the hidden fortune.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the clue in hand and the next brave step ready to be taken, Ian betrays Ben and leaves him and Riley trapped in the wilderness while he pursues the treasure for his own gain. It is up to Ben and Riley to escape the trap, find the treasure and thwart the baddie.</P\r\n\r\n<p><b>Clich Treasure Hunt Action Adventure Checklist:</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.

True the story was as thin as a flea's pubic hair but it was very entertaining and I am even tempted to watch it again. It is a film full of riddles, clues and action. What more could you want in a popcorn public pleaser? Also NT can boast a surprising number of references to previous films, especially Beverly Hills Cop. Could this in itself be a riddle for the fans, a nod to Jerry Bruckheimer or just the sad indication of dried up originality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nicholas Cage, not my favourite actor(have you seen Con Air), has reprised his action man status once again and was both humorous and suitably focused as the hero Ben. Meanwhile Diane Kruger was sexy and confident as the bombshell love interest, and conveniently attractive, academic caught up in the action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sean Bean added some menace as the greedy English treasure hunter prepared to do anything to lay his hands on the loot and his physical presence and confident style mirrored well the goody character, Ben. In support Justin Bartha was a tad annoying as the comedy sidekick but filled a character gap adding a little levity to break the relentless chase along with grumpy disbelieving father Jon Voight also dragged into the quest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all, draw a dotted line between <i>"Raiders of the Lost Ark"</i> and <i>"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"</i> and you would put National Treasure on an equal footing with <i>"The Mummy"</i> somewhere half way between the two extremes.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	71	2011-03-26
72	1	20	\N	The Star Wars Trilogy	<p>How do I even begin to try and explain the Star Wars phenomenon? Firstly, who on the planet has not heard of Star Wars or know what the films were about? There can't be many who have escaped the clutches of possibly the biggest cinema franchise of all time. If you have, where have you been hiding? Do you know what you have been missing? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the early 1970's the science fiction genre had recovered from Kubrick's 2001 and was now reserved for an audience of nerds and B-Movies with the occasional movie gem popping up now and then. In 1977 that all changed when the relatively new director George Lucas released Star Wars. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scale of the story and the effects were unlike anything anyone had seen and the movie instantly became a cinematic landmark. Even today Star Wars is considered a masterpiece by the majority of film critics and it paved the way for a big time revival of the science fiction genre. Following Star Wars, there were two sequels each adding a piece to the saga and paving the way for one of the biggest movie franchises in history. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>A long time ago in a galaxy far away an evil empire has near complete control over countless planets and star systems. The mysterious Emperor Palpatine and his chief henchman, the ruthless Lord Darth Vader, have a tight grip over everyone and kill or destroy any who stand in their way. Against this omnipresent superior power a small rebel alliance fights for freedom. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first film in the Star Wars franchise was titled 'Episode IV: A new Hope" and followed the story of two droids that hold the secret to a weapon of mass destruction. Narrowly escaping the grasp of the sinister Lord Vader, the two droids crash land on a desert moon where they are purchased by a simple farmer and his nephew, Luke Skywalker. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Living a dreary life on a desert planet, Luke dreams of becoming a pilot and fighting in the resistance against the Empire. One day while he is cleaning one of the droids he stumbles on a message fragment that will ultimately lead him on a series of adventures into space and a confrontation with the evil Lord Vader. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the saga unfolds, Luke makes new friends and enemies, joins the rebel alliance and learns about his heritage and the once mighty Jedi Knights who used to maintain the peace before the rise of the Empire. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Jedi had incredible powers including the ability to manipulate minds, to perceive all life around them, to literally see without using their eyes and most impressively, to move objects with the power of thought. Orphaned while only a baby Luke learns that his father was once a great Jedi Knight and that he too possesses the ability to use 'The Force'. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout the three movies (Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi) Luke learns how to use the force and to become a Jedi Knight. Using these new powers he will ultimately confront the Emperor himself and fight for the freedom of all life. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original Star Wars trilogy was packed with action, comedy, special effects, fantastic adventures and even romance. In addition the grand story also dealt with some fairly thought provoking or weighty concepts such as destiny, patricide, racism and environmentalism. Indeed it is hard to find anyone who does not enjoy the movies at least a little and it is no wonder that they have become a cult in their own right. In the last census of the UK, many indicated their religion as Jedi in the hope that they would officially create a new belief system. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at the three movies in retrospect they are by no means perfect but the few faults are outweighed by their enjoyment factor. Weak acting and some truly cheesy moments may be forgiven in a franchise that gave us light sabers, talking dustbins and the best baddie of all time, Darth Vader. Slap on top all of the action and effects and you have one of the most powerful movie scores of all time - popcorn cinema gold.</p>\r\n	5	2011-03-26	72	2011-03-26
75	1	20	\N	Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind	<p>Every film is ultimately the result of a combined effort from a large number of people but on screen there will normally be that certain quality or feature that will give away its creators true identity. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some movies the director will be the dominant force determining the style of the movie and although they are not on screen, we can sometimes spot their trademark signature (e.g Hitchcock's suspense, Lean's love of landscape, Mann's sharp style). However, quite rarely, sometimes the scriptwriter will determine the style of the film. Charlie Kaufman is the writer behind some of the most original movies to hit super status in recent years including 1999's cult classic 'Being John Malkovich', 2002's award winning 'Adaptation' and most recently 2004's 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joel Barish (Jim Carrey - Bruce Almighty) is a fairly weak spirit on this planet. He is quite quiet and does not rate himself high in human society. His life was once happy when he first met wacky wild child Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet - The Life Of David Gale) and their romance filled his soul until, that is, things grew tired and strained and they ultimately split. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>Shortly following their break up, Joel bumps into Clementine in the bookshop where she works and is shocked to learn that she already has another guy but worse still, she is pretending not to recognise him. Later with friends he tells of this recent encounter and learns something even more horrifying that may account for Clementine's curious behaviour. Clementine had visited a special clinic where they remove certain memories to help individuals recover from traumatic relationships. Clementine had erased Joel and their entire history from her memory. To Clementine, Joel is a stranger she has never met. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Angered by this new revelation, Joel visits the clinic and decides that he will erase Clementine from his life. However as the procedure starts to kick in, Joel is forced to relieve his memories of Clementine in reverse. At first this is obviously a trip through strained encounters but soon Joel is visiting happier times and realises too late what he has done. Inside his mind, Joel fights to save his memories of Clementine. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile in the waking world there is a whole separate play taking place. Stan (Mark Ruffalo - Collateral), one of the medics trying to keep Joel's procedure on track, is spending the evening watching over Joel while trying to seduce his colleague Mary (Kirsten Dunst - Spider-Man 2) with some whisky, pot and dancing. However as Joel starts to fight the process, stressed out Stan must try to keep things together while Mary gets the giggles as he calls for the help of his boss, Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson - Girl With A Pearl Earring). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jim Carrey, in what is essentially a straight role, provides a career best as the meek and mild Joel, a role with elements of humour, loss, excitement and tragedy. Similarly, Kate Winslet is great as the loud free spirit Clementine whose blunt comments and bullish attitude provide a nice counterbalance to the quiet placid Joel. Mark Ruffalo and Tim Wilkinson each provide good performances in the secondary stories but the prize for best supporting role is reserved for Kirsten Dunst who gets an opportunity to show a character with both a confident sex appeal and yet an underlying fragility. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a rare treat of a movie. The various parallel stories are each compelling and contain enough twists and concepts to keep your mind on its toes. True, the movie takes a while to get going but if you give it a chance and if you get over the initial surrealism, this is a great film that tackles the subjects of fate and love and will give you plenty to think about. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>What I really enjoyed about this movie was the way in which Kaufman's script managed to make and create a relatively simple concept, that you could erase choice memories, and then explore lots of different consequences that the concept creates. Also the script takes each of the myriad stories and somehow gives them a spin. Once the whole package is put together it may at first glance appear to be a mess but as you watch the various scenes a pattern emerges. This is something great to behold and from a Hollywood script point of view, something rare and inventive. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story of Joel as he tries to stop the procedure provides the main structure of the movie and the general direction, yet it simultaneously explores a standard relationship backward, break up first moving back to the blissful day when they first met. At the same time there is the story of an unscrupulous employee of the clinic who uses stolen memories to exploit previous patients, and the story of a former patient with no recollection of the procedure who stumbles upon her memories. All of these mixed up into one great movie. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I could go on all day about this movie but I've said more than enough already. Hats off to Kaufman and long may he inspire a whole wave of scriptwriters and continue to show Hollywood that the audience is smarter than they think.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	75	2011-03-26
77	1	20	\N	Hero	<p>Before the great empire that is China was formed, there were seven independent nations constantly at war. In Qin, one of the seven countries, the King desired peace through the unity. Alas, the only way to achieve unity was to conquer all seven nations. Of course this threw up more than a few enemies even if the King's motives were sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hero tells the story of the nameless warrior (Jet Li - The One) who arrives at the palace of the King of Qin (Daoming Chen) to report the death of the four most feared assassins from one of the neighbouring countries. The nameless warrior is cordially welcomed into the royal palace and invited to tell the emperor how he, one man, had succeeded against the most ruthless killers when so many before had failed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the nameless warrior tells his story we get to see flashbacks of his confrontations with the solitary spear wielding warrior, Sky (Donnie Yen - Blade II), the beautiful but tragic Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung), the young and passionate Moon (Zhang Ziyi - Rush Hour 2) and the thoughtful and wise Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu Wai - Infernal Affairs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With each part of the story told, the king allows the nameless warrior closer but the warrior may have underestimated the wisdom of the great king. The stories do not ring true in his mind and as the king searches through the warrior's tales to find the truth, we also see the layers of deception revealed. The truth is a powerful hidden story and when finally fully told is both tragic and inspiring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Director Yimou Zhang has created a visually rich film combining the stunning landscapes of China with tremendous wire fighting sequences that, although far fetched in western cinema, are an art form in their own right.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The severe and beautiful natural landscapes of China, the large armies and the location settings such as the royal palace and the besieged school of calligraphy, give a sense of scale to the movie that acts as much more than just a backdrop for the action. There is a strong attention to detail in each scene and this combined with a rich colour pallet gives the movie a great visual impact.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Jet Li is his usual quiet yet intense character in the lead role of the nameless warrior who narrates the various tales. In support, Tony Leung Chiu Wai has probably the most engaging character as assassin Broken Sword who has to choose between his various loyalties to either help the warrior or betray his love. Also worthy of special mention is Daoming Chen as the King of Qin who slowly unravels the tales of the nameless warrior. Although he spends most of his screen time seated, he displays a presence that gives his role as a King an air of sincerity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hero is a beautiful and artistic film set in the time before China. It is understandably filmed in Chinese and has English subtitles. The story, subtle at times, is also quite powerful. Why then should this artistic movie, this fine wine, be presented on 'Share My Popcorn'? A website devoted to the big budget crowd pleasers such as Collateral and Wimbledon? The answer is more complicated than the question but is full of hope, as is the movie.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The story of Hero and the cinematic style are truly artistic yet the film also contains excellent wire fighting sequences and kung fu. The casting of Jet Li in the principle role will attract western audiences who have enjoyed films such as 'The One' and 'Kiss of the Dragon'. In addition the popularity of 2000's Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon shows that there is a large and growing UK audience for artistic and thought provoking action movies from the Far East. Popcorn movies are above all other things popular, and whereas that used to suggest action films full of thin plots and big budget car chases, thankfully times are a changing.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>If you enjoyed Romeo Must Die, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or Kill Bill 1, I would recommend that you see this movie and more importantly see it on the big screen so you can get the most out of the great landscapes.</p> \r\n	4	2011-03-26	77	2011-03-26
78	1	15	\N	Trauma	<p>Thirteen brave souls ventured into the cinema to watch Director Marc Evans' new psychological horror Trauma but only four emerged at the film's end. This wasn't however because some masked psycho was stalking the aisles bumping off unsuspecting movie goers. The other nine viewers had all cut their losses within the first hour on a film that attempted to undo all the good work of other recent British horror flicks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Colin Firth (Love Actually) stars as Ben, a car crash victim who wakes after two weeks in a coma to find his wife dead and the world transfixed by the murder of a pop superstar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ignored by his wife's family and struggling to put his life back in order, Ben moves into a flat on a recently converted hospital ward, the special selling point obviously being the fully equipped abandoned morgue in the basement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon Ben is being plagued by rather uninteresting visions that call into question his memories of exactly what happened on the night of the accident. To make matters worse, the police have identified him as prime suspect in the pop star's brutal murder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firth deserves credit for realising that the British film industry can only supply him with one romantic comedy role co-starring Hugh Grant a year and that it was time to try out a different genre. Unfortunately his performance is beyond dull and he often comes across as mildly perplexed rather than grief stricken and unhinged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mena Suvari (American Beauty) co-stars as Charlotte, Ben's aura reading landlady, who takes a shine to her loopy tenant despite the fact that he wanders the corridors with blood soaked hands and occasionally screams abuse at her. Rather than gullibly closing her eyes every time Ben says 'trust me' she should evict the nut job for keeping an ant farm in a strictly no pets flat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a horror film that has to rely on the string section of its orchestra to signpost the scary bits because otherwise you would probably miss them. Repetitive speeded up camera tricks that have been seen before in a dozen other films are used to convey Ben's fractured mind to little effect. Even a host of scuttling insects and spiders failed to scare the arachnophobia sufferers in the audience. In fact the only psychological disorder this film raised in me was narcolepsy.</p>\r\n\r\n	1	2011-03-26	78	2011-03-26
79	1	15	\N	The Layer Cake	<p>Viewers expecting first time director Matthew Vaughn to follow the already well trodden path of nineties British gangster films pioneered by his friend, and partner in crime, Guy Ritchie will be pleasantly surprised. Layer Cake is a very different film to Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. The characters aren't merely cheeky cockney stereotypes, the violence is not cartoonish, the comedy in this film doesn't stem from characters shouting strings of expletives and Vinnie Jones is nowhere to be seen. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The twisting plot begins with chav wide boy Duke and his shell suit wearing girlfriend Sasha raiding an Amsterdam Ecstasy lab and making off with a million stolen tablets. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately their victims are the Serbian mob, who don't take kindly to the theft and dispatch a hired assassin to retrieve the drugs and punish those responsible. Personally I am beginning to worry that the entire population of Eastern Europe is made up exclusively of highly trained, psychotic hit men. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The almost universal excellent standard of acting is the film's greatest attribute. Daniel Craig's (Road to Perdition) nameless criminal has considerable charisma and manages to retain the audience's sympathy as he goes about his dubious business. At one point he gives a perfect audition for the part of the next James Bond as he brandishes a gun for the first time in the film and slinks around a flat. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Colm Meaney (Blueberry) and George Harris give able support as the two senior members of our leading man's crew. Both radiate a palpable sense of barely restrained violence and once again this film poses the question as to what exactly you have to do to earn an 18 Certificate from the British Board of Film Classification. When Harris (last seen playing an affable pensioner in BBC crime drama 55 Degrees North) comes across an old criminal associate while eating breakfast in a corner caf he delivers a beating that left the audience cringing in shock. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately the film does have its disappointing aspects. Sienna Miller finally makes her big screen debut as Tammy after spending what feels like several years performing the coveted role of Jude Law's arm candy. Despite being used extensively in the film's marketing campaign Miller fails to make much of an impression as an actress due to a lack of screen time. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Occasionally the script doesn't live up to the talents of its actors which is disappointing considering writer J. J. Connelly is responsible for the excellent novel on which the film is based as well as the screenplay. Most disappointingly however is that the film suffers from the common complaint of not knowing when to end. The constant double crossing and reversals of fortune become repetitive to the extent that the film should have ended at least two twists earlier than it finally did. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>However considering what a bad year it has been so far for British films, Layer Cake marks a significant improvement. Vaughn's confident arrival as a director suggests that he will become an even bigger success than Ritchie, even if he, like his friend, can't seem to stop casting Dexter Fletcher.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	79	2011-03-26
81	1	12	\N	Oldboy	<p>In the last few years, Korea has seen a significant upsurge in both the quantity and quality of its films to the point where it is one of the few countries where domestic films outperform those of Hollywood. Romantic comedies are the most popular, but the sheer volume of melodramatic, rehashed garbage being produced threatens to overwhelm the more distinctive films, such as Chan-wook Park's <i>Oldboy</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arrested one day for being drunk and disorderly, Oh Dae-su is subsequently kidnapped and imprisoned without reason - for fifteen years. During his incarceration, he fills notebook after notebook with the names of all the people he has wronged in his life, yet he cannot think of anyone who would have cause to retaliate in such a way. When he is unexpectedly released, Dae-su is given clothes, money, a mobile phone and five days in which to find out the truth behind who did this to him and, more importantly, why. If he succeeds, the man responsible, Woo-jin, will commit suicide. If he fails, the woman he loves will die. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's ironic that Quentin Tarantino was the jury president when the 2004 Cannes Grand Prix was awarded to <i>Oldboy</i>. As a revenge tale, <i>Oldboy</i> blows <i>Kill Bill</i> away, pushing the envelope far beyond that attempted by Tarantino's bloated monstrosity, and for that matter any other modern-day film made in the West. The simple premise hides a dark and harrowing tale of morality and extreme vengeance, where the truth can be as much a prison as it is salvation. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Park doesn't hold back in any areas of the film, and his unflinching approach to <i>Oldboy</i>'s moments of brutal violence are matched by the naked emotion on display during such scenes as the gut-wrenching confrontation between Dae-su and Woo-jin. The\r\ndirection is deceptively simple and keeps the action sequences in line with the rest of the film, yet Park still manages to achieve moments of cinematic brilliance, such as the manic claw-hammer brawl in which Dae-su takes on a horde of attackers in a narrow corridor, shown as a single, continuous tracking shot scrolling from left to right as if a live-action beat-em-up game. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dae-su is a man on the very edge of insanity and Min-sik Choi manages to encapsulate this with a highly intense performance. His wild hair, flattened knuckles and sociopathic behaviour all contribute to Choi's larger-than-life screen presence, and he is absolutely riveting as he moves between wide-eyed despair, cold calculation and extreme rage. Ji-tae Yu almost matches Choi with a completely inverted role as the calmly sadistic manipulator, Woo-jin Lee. His smug arrogance is the flip-side to Dae-su's out of control wrath, and he seems to revel in goading Dae-su on to further excess. It's a far cry from his rather disappointing role in the Bladerunner rip-off, <i>Natural City</i>, and shows that he can do well when given the right material. Completing the triangle is Hye-jeong Kang's Mi-do, also worthy of mention for her mix of maturity and naivety, off-setting Dae-su's rampage with a measure of childish innocence. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Hollywood remake is in the works, for all the usual pitiful reasons, but this is one film that has no need for an improvement or a Western make-over. With its dark story and ultra violence (not all of it perpetrated against humans), I'll be very surprised if <i>Oldboy</i> survives the transition intact. I can only say that if it inspires people to look up the original, then all well and good, but until that day comes you have no excuse not to see <i>Oldboy</i> film in all its original glory.</p>\r\n \r\n\r\n	4	2011-03-26	81	2011-03-26
82	1	15	\N	Coach Carter	<p>Although the exact details of the 'sports movie' do change from film to film they all generally follow the same pattern. A new coach arrives to train a team of ill-disciplined youngsters stuck on a losing streak. Although the kids have poor team spirit, the coach recognises the undeniable talent lurking just beneath the surface. At first the hard line coach is hated both as an outsider and for his tough training measures but slowly as the team begin to win, thanks to their manager's methods, a grudging respect forms between them and their coach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although it would be nice to proclaim that Coach Carter sweeps away this crowd pleasing but tired format I would, unfortunately, be lying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ken Carter (Samuel L. Jackson - Jackie Brown) returns to his childhood high school to take over as the new basketball coach. The team of established players are unimpressed by his tough discipline and his insistence that success on the field has to be matched by achievement in the classroom. While his group of strutting teenagers can't see beyond the current Basketball season, Carter is more preoccupied with saving them from a likely future of crime and prison by getting them into college.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the presence of Samuel L. Jackson is the only real reason anyone should actually be watching this film, even he seems to slowly wilt under the weight of the corny dialogue. The early scenes of him disciplining his mouthy bunch of school kids with a combination of suicide runs, push ups and cracking one liners are really rather entertaining. It's not long before the most intimidating stare in show business is used to full effect on those who choose not to respect his authority. Sadly he doesn't then produce a semi automatic and vent his furious anger on the team in the style of Pulp Fiction. Unfortunately the momentum of these early scenes is wasted over a ridiculously long two hours plus running time. Carter's pep talks about "being all you can be" soon become repetitive and Jackson's deliveries are less stirring as the film travels to its conclusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps if Jackson didn't have to carry the entire movie himself it would have proven less of a slog, but the team themselves are disappointingly one dimensional. There is the loud rebellious one, the very rebellious one, the tall, stupid rebellious one and not forgetting the rebellious one who almost always wears a hat. With characterisation like this Samuel must have thought he was back in Australia filming Star Wars prequels with George Lucas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If this review sounds unduly harsh for a film rated three stars out of five, then the reader is clearly forgetting the sinister ability of all sports movies to shamelessly manipulate the viewers' emotions and thankfully, in this respect, Coach Carter does not differ from the pack. With a vice like grip the slimy 'follow your dreams' message seized my cynical reviewers heart and had me cheering and hugging complete strangers in the cinema as those loveable ruffians overcome all manner of trials to reach for that rainbow. It's only now, with hindsight, that I realise that I was used by Coach Carter and I feel cheap.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	82	2011-03-26
83	1	15	\N	Skeleton Key	<p>It would be easy to explain away the current trend of extremely gifted young actresses popping up in less than illustrious horror films as simply a lack of decent serious roles for women. Following hot on the heels of Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly's lead role in remake nonsense Dark Water, comes Oscar nominee Kate Hudson (Raising Helen) in voodoo fright fest, The Skeleton Key.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>This theory of acting talent slumming it in slasher films falls down however because while neither of these two films are particularly good, neither of them are actual horror films. The Skeleton Key, while not nearly as bad as snoozeathon Dark Water, fails to deliver any gut churning unpleasantness or gravity defying jumps. Instead the actresses get decent sized pay checks and maintain their dignity while the film studio gets a hefty opening weekend at the box office after thousands of gullible teenagers part with their cash expecting to be scared witless but only get bored senseless.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>This isn't to say that The Skeleton Key is a bad movie, it isn't. The film is competently acted and the cinematography taking in swathes of Louisiana swamp is really quite beautiful but, as a horror, I've seen more frightening episodes of Neighbours.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The plot concerns Ben Devereaux (John Hurt - Valiant [voice]), an old man who has recently suffered a stroke, and his wife Violet (Gena Rowlands - The Notebook) who needs help to look after her husband in their enormous creaking home during his last days. In steps nurse Caroline who immediately takes an interest in the houses' history and the bumps upstairs in the attic until she becomes convinced something sinister lies behind the cause of Ben's illness.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Kate Hudson works hard as incredibly nosey nurse Caroline but is hampered by a character that is difficult to empathise with. Caroline tramples around enough places uninvited and ignores so much good advice to leave the mysterious situation well alone, that in the end the audience can't help but feel she deserves any horrible fate that comes her way for being so pig-headed. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Unfortunately horrible fates are a little thin on the ground in this film, as are murderers, monsters, ghosts, scares or even a little bit of tension. The crumbling plantation house is a potentially scary set with its peeling walls and layers of dust but every time the apprehension in the house builds beyond anything slightly nervy, Caroline disappears off back to New Orleans where the crowds and bright lights dispel any sense that her character is in jeopardy.</p> \r\n \r\n<p>Gena Rowlands is excellent as the old fashioned lady of the house. Her alternatively sugary then poisonous conversations with Hudson are the film's dramatic highlights. Unfortunately, while her character carries a menacing personality, she certainly isn't physically threatening so her eventual confrontation with Hudson is less than terrifying. You wonder why an athletic female in her twenties does so much running away from an elderly old lady instead of just smacking the old crone in the chops and demand she tells her what's really going on.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>This movie has less atmosphere than deep space and you'll be waiting two hours for a scare before realising the only frightening thing about the film is how the makers managed to waste the talents of a fine actor like John Hurt in a practically non speaking role. If you do insist on seeing this film, there is some enjoyment to be had working out the mystery of exactly who is doing what to whom and why, but even this puzzle is a small pleasure as observant viewers should have worked out exactly what is going on at least twenty minutes from the end.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	83	2011-03-26
85	1	20	\N	Cinderella Man	<p>Sometimes you see a trailer for a new movie and think <i>"that movie is designed and engineered to win an Oscar"</i>. A sad feeling for a film fan, to think that the people who put dreams into reality can work so hard to win a small gold action figure that doesn't even move. When I saw the trailer for <i>'Cinderella Man'</i> I noticed the fine music, the beautiful camera work and the classic tale of triumph over adversity and I thought to myself, <i>"Not again."</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>True, this movie does tread a well explored path but somehow it feels fresh and for that, if not for all the other reasons, I can list this as a great movie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on a true story Russell Crowe (Master & Commander) stars as Jim Braddock, a great boxer who like many found himself facing hardship during the great depression. With a loving wife (Rene Zellweger - Bridget Jones), three young kids and barely enough money to buy a pint of milk, Braddock faced the challenging times with courage. After a broken hand cuts short his career and the world around him spirals toward anarchy, food and money grow short on supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then one day, out of the blue, Jim is offered the chance to return to the ring for a one off fight when a young fighter has to drop out at the last moment. Jim is an outside bet, unlikely to win but he doesn't care. Even if he loses he'll still earn a few dollars; enough to get some food on the table. In the ring Jim tries his best and against all odds he wins. That win sparks the greatest comeback trail in boxing history. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year Clint Eastwood's <i>"Million Dollar Baby"</i>, a boxing film, won a whole host of awards and it would be too easy to try and compare last year's success with this, Ron Howard's latest. Luckily, despite having similar subject matter, these movies are entirely different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russell Crowe is once again the former warrior who is ruined and returns from the ashes to fight overwhelming odds and inspire his fellow man. However instead of sandals and suntan lotion this film actually demands his talent as an actor rather than an action man, and I was impressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The focus in Cinderella Man, as with most Ron Howard movies, is the family. Russell Crowe gives a career best performance as a common man that has fallen on hard times. An honest realistic man pushed to the limits by circumstances out of his control who has to watch helplessly as his family, his life, are almost taken away by poverty. Crowe is astounding and this is easily his finest performance yet and considering his impressive CV, that is saying something.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sharing center stage, Renee Zellweger as Braddock's wife Mae, really connects with the audience as she struggles to feed and care for three children while her husband searches in vain for work and money. Zellweger's portrayal is moving and blends perfectly with Crowe's in the scenes they share. Such great chemistry you can't help but get drawn into the drama. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In support, and adding the needed humour, Paul Giamatti (Sideways) gives another fantastic performance as Braddock's boxing coach and manager, Joe Gould. The one line quips and the dry cynicism combined with the partly hidden humanity make for great ring side camaraderie with the hacks while also yelling abuse and tips to his fighter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Director Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind) keeps the attention on Braddock and his family and extends this to the community who finds hope through the persistence of the relentless boxer. By the time we reach the big showdown, it feels like all of New York is behind Braddock and you share each moment of the big fight. The boxing scenes are some of the best on film and you almost feel the punches as the camera closes in on the action. Ron Howard has made great movies; <i>Apollo 13</i>, <i>Ransom</i>, <i>A Beautiful Mind</i>, and <i>Cinderella Man</i> continues that fantastic trend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Combining the set pieces of depression era America, drab costumes and the gritty fighting scenes with the family aspect and persistent hope through diversity, this film is more readily compared to <i>Seabiscuit</i> than <i>Million Dollar Baby</i>. Was it designed to win Oscar's? If it was, it deserves them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recommended for fans of <i>"Seabiscuit"</i>, <i>"A Beautiful Mind"</i>, <i>"Million Dollar Baby"</i> and <i>"Raging Bull"</i>.</p>\r\n	5	2011-03-26	85	2011-03-26
87	1	16	\N	Cellular	<p>Just as you thought you were safe in the confines of your own home, something terrible happens...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Science teacher Jessica Martin (Kim Basinger - 8 Mile) is part of a normal family married to an estate agent, Craig and with a son, Ricky. But one day the unimaginable happens, Jessica is kidnapped and held hostage in an empty attic with nothing but the fragments of a shattered telephone to keep her company. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile in laid-back Santa Monica, Ryan (Chris Evans - Not Another Teen Movie) and his mates are relaxing at the beach watching the ladies go by. While his friends are trying to hit on the girls, Ryan is busy trying to win back his ex-girlfriend unaware of what fate has destined for him. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Switch once again to a third character, this time a retiring policeman named Mooney (William H Macy - Seabiscuit) who is all set on starting up a day spa with his wife and a cheery future free from crime and detection. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back in the attic, after a terrifying encounter with her captor, Greer (Jason Statham - Collateral), Jessica manages to piece together the shattered telephone and ring a random number by tapping wires. Ryan is the recipient, driving his car along the coast listening to a seemingly deranged woman who claims to have been kidnapped. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>How many people would believe a hysterical woman who calls up randomly and claims she is being held prisoner in an attic? Luckily Ryan is eventually convinced that her call is genuine and agrees to visit the police where he meets Mooney. However events take a further twist as Ryan has to race across town to try and save Jessica's son. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>After this hectic first act, the rest of the movie follows the stories of each of the three principle characters as they are drawn into the mystery of the attack on the Martin family. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>Leading man and relative newcomer to the big screen, Chris Evans provides plenty of eye candy which is reason alone for the female audience to see this film. Kim Basinger puts in an emotional performance as the fear stricken yet gutsy mother after many years out of the limelight. Cast as the villain, Jason Statham is truly menacing as the quiet yet intimidating thug and despite a dodgy American accent gives dark edge to his otherwise comical cockney tough guy CV. Finally William H Macy is as impressive as ever as the inquisitive cop. He may not be as physically impressive as young hunk Evans but he displays better acting skills. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cellular is a film about a race against time, which will keep the audience enthralled throughout. If you liked Nick of Time or any "innocent thrust into chaos" suspense thrillers, this is a must see. Cellular is a great entertaining popcorn movie that has snuck up under the hype radar and is worthy of attention.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	87	2011-03-26
88	1	15	\N	Saw	<p>'Dare you see Saw?' demands the poster, apparently not advertising a new adventure playground but in fact a film that has been branded not only the most gruesome but also the most innovative horror of the Halloween season.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Unfortunately for the film, already burdened enough with expectation, it has been compared favourably to David Fincher's Seven. It isn't in the same league.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>First time writer/director James Wan has come up with a suitably diabolical premise, the Jigsaw killer has been abducting individuals who he believes deserve to be taught a lesson. Each is delivered into extremely unpleasant situations where they have to prove how much they want to live, often at a deadly price.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>One unfortunate victim is revealed to have recently attempted to commit suicide by slitting his wrists. The killer decides to test his resolve by leaving him naked in a room surrounded by thickets of razor wire. If he truly wishes to die all he has to do is sit still and wait to die of thirst but if he fancies a shot at life then he can head for the door. Needless to say death by a thousand cuts shortly follows.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Certainly the film is malicious in its intent but strangely not as gory as might have been expected. Much of the blood letting happens off camera and some victims are spared before the most hideous deaths are dealt.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Much of the film is told from the perspective of the Jigsaw killers' latest victims, surgeon Lawrence (Cary Elwes - The Princess Brides) and photographer Adam (newcomer Leigh Whannell). Lawrence must kill Adam by six o' clock or his wife and child will meet a grisly end. The only problem is that to reach Adam, or even attempt escape, Lawrence will have to cut off his chained foot with a rusty looking hacksaw.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Also along for the ride is Danny Glover as the lead detective on the case who cunningly works out the villain's hide out only an hour into the film. His character comes up with a wonderfully novel reason why only him and his partner should raid the building in the dead of night ("Ah, the darkness will allow the two of us to sneak up on him!"). As soon as I noticed that Danny's partner wasn't Mel Gibson I feared for his long-term health.</p> \r\n \r\n<p>The film can rightly claim it is filled with suitably sick ideas but it isn't going to revolutionise the horror genre simply because the audience was spending too much time laughing at the movies' expense which hardly raised the tension as the clock wound down. Only one sequence was suitably nerve wracking, as Adam investigates his pitch black apartment with nothing but the flash bulb on his camera.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Likewise, a lot of time and thought has clearly gone into constructing a suitably unsettling ending but like everything else in the film, it doesn't hold up when compared to other similar films, especially a certain well thought of example that featured Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and a cardboard box.</p>	3	2011-03-26	88	2011-03-26
89	1	15	\N	The Goonies	<p>After watching The Goonies for the first time I immediately rounded up my own gang of pint sized buddies to embark on a life changing adventure of our own. Unfortunately, as far as we were aware, undiscovered pirate gold wasn't exactly littering the booby trapped wilds of Hertfordshire. Before we had even crossed paths with any wanted convicts, Rebecca had fallen off her bike and grazed her knee and Peter wanted to go home because it had started to drizzle. I doubt Mikey, Mouth or Data would have approved.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Now, almost twenty years after the world first witnessed the truffle shuffle, the Raiders of the Lost Ark for pre-teens has belatedly arrived on DVD in all its sparkling glory. Watching The Goonies today is just as much fun as it was when I was ten.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The plot, as if you need reminding, follows seven kids on their quest to discover the buried treasure of pirate One Eyed Willy in a maze of dangerous caves and tunnels while being pursued by the menacing Mama Fratelli (Anne Ramsey - Throw Mama from the Train) and her accident prone sons.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Highlights are numerous, from the opening car chase to the appearance of the pirate ship on the horizon at the end. In between we have Sloth and the Superman theme, Data and his pinchers of power, Mouth's tour in Spanish, Brand stealing the tricycle, Andy in her sweater and anytime Chunk opens his mouth.</p>  \r\n \r\n<p>The disc itself, while not exactly packed with special features, does include a hidden gem of a video commentary that allows the audience not only to hear but to see the cast. Director Richard Donner reminisces about the difficulties of working with a child cast while the goonies all grown up prove to be just as badly behaved today as they were then. Sean Astin (Mikey) may be familiar thanks to his portrayal of Samwise Gamgee in Lord of the Rings but the return of Corey Feldman (Mouth) to our screens two decades on is a revelation.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The deleted scenes reveal why Data tells the assembled reporters on the beach at the end of the film that 'the Octopus was really scary.' It isn't, which probably explains why it was cut. What is terrifying however is Cyndi Lauper's ten-minute-long music video that inexplicably features a green skinned witch, Steven Spielberg and Andre the Giant.</p>\r\n	5	2011-03-26	89	2011-03-26
90	1	15	\N	Bubba Ho-Tep	<p>Listen carefully. I will explain this only once. Elvis Presley, the King of rock and roll, isn't dead. He is quietly living out the last of his days in a Texas rest home under the name of Sebastian Haff, a washed up Elvis impersonator. The unfortunate flabby body found dead on a Graceland toilet in 1977 was in fact Haff, a man that Elvis had traded places with several years earlier when the pressures and distractions of fame had become too much to live with. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the only proof of his true identity destroyed in a fire, a lonely and sickly Elvis is forced to spend his days shuffling around the corridors with nothing to occupy his mind but his own regrets and the ramblings of a wheelchair bound black pensioner who claims to be John F. Kennedy. And if you think that is weird just wait until the three thousand year old undead mummy turns up and starts to kill the residents. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on a short story by Joe R. Lansdale, Bubba Ho-Tep is by far the most original and quirky film to hit cinemas this year but most surprisingly its success is built not on its cult premise but on a quality script and good acting. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bruce Campbell (The Evil Dead Trilogy) is given the opportunity as Elvis to prove he is far more than a B-Movie actor by giving a truthful and sympathetic portrayal of a man who fears his approaching death and worries if he will ever be able to correct his life's many mistakes. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ella Joyce gives able support as the no-nonsense nurse who is administering medication to a worrying lump on Mr Presley's penis which Elvis is convinced is life threatening. Apart from the pecker problem however, there is very little comedy in Bubba Ho-Tep and occasionally the film is more successful in unsettling the viewer such as when the mummy is first glimpsed at the end of a darkened corridor or when a patient is dragged away by unseen forces from Elvis' doorway. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes the film decides to be odd just for the sake of it, such as when it is revealed that the mummy sucks his victims souls out of their backsides, but the scene where Elvis takes on a giant scarab beetle in his bedroom will resonate with anyone who has ever been forced to confront a multi coloured and apparently foreign insect in the dead of night. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Budget limitations do hinder the film in places and the climatic showdown between a character dependant on a zimmer frame and a stunt man in slightly unconvincing monster suit is just as exciting as this description suggests. Despite this, the film is a welcome respite from the largely uninspired films on our screens at the moment and is well worth watching if you can unearth a multiplex that will show it.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	90	2011-03-26
92	1	15	\N	I Heart Huckabees	<p>When Albert Markovski (Jason Schwartzman - Rushmore), head of pressure group the Open Spaces Coalition, repeatedly crosses paths with an African doorman he becomes convinced that this series of coincidences holds the key to life's greatest mysteries.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Seeking guidance to unravel his experiences, Albert hires the Existential Detectives, played with gusto by Lily Tomlin (Orange County) and a mop haired Dustin Hoffman (Runaway Jury) to investigate. This pair of married philosophers root through their clients' lives until they can identify the cause of the metaphysical problems their charges are facing and then work with them to solve it.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Dismissing the doorman incidents as nothing more than simple coincidence, the detectives target Albert's work as the source of his crisis, more specifically his conflict with corporate sleaze bag Brad (Jude Law - Alfie) who is trying to force him out of his position as head of the Open Spaces Coalition so that he and his company, Huckabees super-store, can take credit for saving a local marsh and woodland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fearing that the presence of two Existential Detectives at his work will play further into Brad's hands and make his colleagues think he is weirder than they do already, Albert begins to resist and instead falls into league with rogue French philosopher Catherine Vauban (Isabelle Huppert) who argues that existence is nothing more than futile chance.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>As film premises go, I Heart Huckabees' philosophical battles don't immediately demand attention among other less challenging offerings at the cinema but director David O. Russell's first film since Three Kings is well worth taking a chance on.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Admittedly the film's oddball premise is off putting at first and Schwartzman's poetry spouting, whiney protagonist doesn't command immediate sympathy but gradually the film's quirky charm worms its way under your skin until you become as rapt as in any conventional film.</p> \r\n \r\n<p>The cast is universally excellent. The fact that everyone involved seems to genuinely enjoying themselves becomes infectious and many of the actors produce their most entertaining performances in recent years. Jude Law confirms that he is at his best when playing a weasel and doesn't have to carry an entire movie himself. Schwartzman proves to be an actor who deserves more opportunities to show off his considerable talent while Mark Wahlberg (The Italian Job) steals the movie as Tommy, a conflicted firefighter who can't stop worrying about America's dependency on oil.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>It isn't until Albert is paired with Tommy to confront their issues together that the film begins to work as the eccentric comedy it clearly wants to be. Their visit to the foster family of the African doorman is a hilarious assault on middle American values while their ascension to a higher state of existence simply by hitting each other with a space hopper is ridiculously silly.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>While perhaps not to everyone's tastes those who like to contemplate the meaning of existence, and whether or not there is in fact a larger plan we are all part of will be provoked and informed. Alternatively if you fancy seeing Jude Law suckle a grown man on his nipple before being beaten up by Shania Twain, this also is the film for you.</p>	4	2011-03-26	92	2011-03-26
94	1	15	\N	The Incredibles	<p>Bob Parr is not your average insurance claims expert and The Incredibles is not your average animated movie. It won't be the most commercially successful of the Disney-Pixar collaborations but it is by far, far and away the best. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film kicks off with a day that is anything but average for resident superhero Mr Incredible. Apart from the usual catching of armed robbers, saving cats up trees and foiling the plots of the ingeniously named French supervillain 'Bomb Voyage' our masked hero has to make it to the church on time for his wedding to Elastigirl. Unfortunately on the way he saves a man who was attempting to commit suicide and makes a lasting enemy. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several lawsuits later that cost the government millions, the world's superheroes are forced to enter into a relocation programme where they will hide their extraordinary powers and live out their lives in anonymity. Mr Incredible and Elastigirl become Bob and Helen Parr and their children, Jack , Violet and Dash, must pretend to be regular American kids. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bob however is unsatisfied with his mundane life and still longs for the glory days so when he gets the opportunity to pull on his old jumpsuit again by a secretive organisation he seizes the chance. Little does Mr Incredible know that his decision has placed both himself and his family in terrible danger. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>What sets The Incredibles apart from other Pixar films is that the formula that has proved so successful for Monsters Inc and Finding Nemo, kids films that don't bore the socks off adults, has been reversed. Writer- director Brad Bird has created an animated adventure that principally appeals to adults. Kids will appreciate the non stop action in the film's second hour but most of the comedy is aimed at people who are old enough to have seen Superman and watched more than their fair share of James Bond movies. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lessons about tolerance and friendship that have been the staple messages of Toy Story and its successors are replaced here with questions about whether it is right to hide a gift for fear of making others feel inferior. Adult themes usually absent from Disney releases appear with frequency, Helen worries her husband is cheating on her while Mr Incredible breaks down in grief when he believes his family has been murdered. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason for this dark streak running through the core of the film is undoubtedly Bird whose previous animated offerings have included work on the Simpsons and 1999's The Iron Giant, a film far better than the size of the audience it attracted. In Bird's universe, actions have consequence and superheroes are not invulnerable. People do die in the Incredibles. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If all this sounds a little heavy for an animated adventure film, the comedy is frequent and always spot on. Bob in his car, Elastigirl caught in a series of sliding doors, and the dangers of wearing capes are all inspired moments. Watching Mr Incredible squaring up to a giant robotic billiard ball is the most entertaining action scene of 2004. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The voice work is universally excellent and shows the wisdom of hiring talented vocalists rather than simply a host of star names. It is a lesson the makers of Shark Tale should take note of. Particularly good are Craig T. Nelson as Mr Incredible and Jason Lee voicing the diabolical Syndrome, although the exception to the above rule, Samuel L. Jackson, walks away with almost all of his scenes as Mr Incredible's superhero buddy Frozone. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In comparison to this year's rival DreamWorks offerings, Shark Tale and Shrek 2, which were lazy, derivative and uninspired, The Incredibles has pushed the boundaries of what animated films can achieve. You will love it, but your ten year old will still prefer Finding Nemo.</p>\r\n	5	2011-03-26	94	2011-03-26
95	1	20	\N	After The Sunset	<p>There are a few ingredients that may make a film what we class as 'Popcorn'. Some who read this may argue over what they feel those ingredients are but generally if a film has some good action, some big stars and a touch of comedy, it'll hit the popcorn masses and be a hit, even if it isn't a great film. This describes Brett Ratner's 'After the Sunset' quite well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pierce Brosnan (Die Another Day) stars as Max Burdett, the worlds finest thief who uses ingenious cunning to purloin the worlds most precious gems. Assisted by his highly desirable girlfriend Lola (Salma Hayek - Once Upon a Time in Mexico) and pursued by comical yet defiant FBI Agent Stan Lloyd (Woody Harrelson - Anger Management), Max decides to retire with Lola to a sunny island paradise.</p>  \r\n\r\n<p>A life of leisure, pretty coloured cocktails and lobster dinners soon becomes boring and Max begins to get a little restless. When his old nemesis Stan arrives in town, Max learns that one of the world's finest diamonds will be visiting aboard a luxury liner. Can Max stop resist temptation? Stan thinks he can't and is adamant he'll catch the thief this time. Meanwhile Lola takes her retirement seriously and despite trying to keep Max on the straight and narrow, she fears he may slip back into bad habits. Add to this an industrious local crime lord with an interest in the gem and you have the basic thin setting of After the Sunset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I find it strangely ironic that a man named Ratner should make a film about a heist for one of the world's most priceless diamonds. With a simple well trodden story thread combined with elements of a buddy comedy and a gangster flick it is easy to recognise Ratner's 'Rush Hour' roots creeping into this movie. The duo of Pierce and Woody is surprisingly good and offers some great moments.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Pierce, as cool as ever, is effectively the straight guy while Harrelson, who has been away from main major roles for some time returns from cameo snippets with a great performance. The two actors although polar at first appearance, actually form a good double act and keep the film light. At the same time Salma Hayek is fantastic as Lola. Considering she is mainly featured as eye candy, Salma manages to give enough character to the role of Lola to make her more than just a great body in a swim suit (although she does look damn fine).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no real need to dwell on the acting here. This isn't Shakespeare, it's just a bit of fun, and a good bit of fun at that. We could comment on Don Cheadle (Ocean's 11) who's crime boss character is superfluous to the story, or the slow build up to the inevitable heist, but these minor flaws do not detract from what is at the end of the day, a simple popcorn movie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to watch some sexy ladies parading around a comedy heist movie set in the Caribbean with the perpetually cool Mr Bond, sorry I mean Brosnan, then this is a great movie for you. I'd recommend it to any fan of the Rush Hour movies or Bad Boys 2.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	95	2011-03-26
96	1	16	\N	Wolf Creek	<p>Director Greg McLean's feature film debut <i>Wolf Creek</i> is based on a number of real-life cases of missing persons who have disappeared in the Australian Outback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film opens with the same chilling statistics seen in the trailer. About 30,000 people go missing in Australia every year, 10% of those are never seen again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wolf Creek tells the story of three friends on a road trip, Brits Kristy (Kestie Morassi - Darkness Falls) and Lizzie (Cassandra Magrath) and their friendly Aussie Ben (Nathan Phillips - Neighbours [TV]). The trio drive along deserted highways on their way to visit the famous Wolf Creek meteor crater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once there the friends abandon their car and prepare for the three-hour hike to get to the top of the crater. On their return to the car, they experience engine trouble and end up stranded for the night in the middle of nowhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unexpectedly, a local hick comes to their rescue and offers to fix up their car back at his place - fair dinkum, mate! Haven't the three characters ever heard the saying, 'don't talk to strangers'?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a fireside bevy of dodgy rainwater, and while Mick (John Jarratt) attempts to 'pimp their ride', Lizzie, Kristy and Ben swiftly drift off to sleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When they awake, the realisation of what has happened to them is horrifying. Separated from each other they wake to find themselves bound, gagged and subjected to torture and excruciating pain. Can they escape the evil clutches of the serial killing mechanic before it is too late? You will have to watch it to find out!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some viewers might agree that the film ends with a thought provoking cliffhanger. I certainly found myself questioning what really happened. However as the movie is only loosely based on real events, five minutes web browsing and you soon realise the film is a hash of lots of rumours and a fair splash of artistic license.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The acting in Wolf Creek was convincing even with the lack of big names. The best performance by far comes from John Jarratt who really puts across his character and was truly menacing as the chuckling and merciless serial killer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With its handheld camera filming and low budget, Wolf Creek is very Blair Witch-esque. Its lack of originality is the reason why it loses stars in the rating. Perhaps if it had been released several years before the likes of <i>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i> (remake), it might have notched up more stars. I've also seen it compared to the British horror, <i>The Descent</i>. Both films share similar structural patterns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first half of the film begins by building up the character stories and the second part contains all the gore and killing. Likewise, both films make the best of a low budget. But while The Descent gains credibility for a new take on the usual horror movie plot, Wolf Creek pales in significance and comes across as tame in comparison.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wolf Creek is worth watching if you are a dedicated horror movie fan. If you enjoy horrors that are loosely based on true events, such as <i>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>, <i>The Amityville Horror</i> or <i>The Blair Witch Project</i>, then go see this movie. If you demand more originality from your horror movies then steer clear of it.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	96	2011-03-26
101	1	15	\N	Churchill - The Hollywood Years	<p>If you think about the premise of Churchill: The Hollywood Years really, really hard, contemplate the possibilities and imagine the potential for rib tickling comedy you will, for the shortest of instances, smile. A moment after that grin has slipped from your face you will realise that actually the idea is a load of self indulgent cobblers.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Provided you haven't just spent six hours watching Operation Burma, U-571 and The Patriot back-to-back, any pent up enthusiasm for this film will drain out of you within two minutes of the opening scene.   Tony Blair is informed that the cigar chomping, V-saluting prime minister, who the world believed to be Winston Churchill, was in fact Roy Bubbles, after dinner speaker. The real Churchill was actually an American marine Captain on assignment to the United Kingdom who alone managed to keep the Nazis at bay.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Christian Slater (Broken Arrow) and Neve Campbell (Scream) gamely throw themselves into the roles of Churchill and Princess Elizabeth respectively and as a result maintain much of their dignity. Disappointingly it is the gallery of British comedy talent that fails to rise to the challenge of producing a laugh. Particularly guilty are Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer who play a pair of mincing man servants working in Buckingham Palace.</p> \r\n \r\n<p>On the positive side of things Leslie Philips (Out of Africa) makes a welcome appearance as a sniveling politician and well, um, that's it!</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The plot, and I use the term loosely, sees Britain and the monarchy threatened by Adolf Hitler who has been secretly smuggled into England where he stages a miniature invasion by taking over Buckingham Palace. A young Princess Elizabeth enlists the help of Churchill to save both her family and her country.</p> \r\n \r\n<p>American audiences will not appreciate being mocked for an hour and a half as Slater spouts nationalistic rubbish and kicks in doors. Meanwhile the British cinema-goer will quickly tire of a historical fantasy that caricatures them as either cowards or gay with the 'wink wink' justification that it's a spoof. Spoofs have to be funny.</p>\r\n	1	2011-03-26	101	2011-03-26
102	1	16	\N	Into The Blue	<p>As if there weren't enough pretty people films, another one floods our screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Into the Blue is about a diving couple, Jared (Paul Walker - Too Fast Too Furious) and Sam (Jessica Alba - Fantastic Four), who have a comfortable, yet minimalist, life in the sunny Caribbean.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Jared's old college buddy, Bryce (Scott Caan - Ocean's Twelve) is in town with new girlfriend, Amanda (Ashley Scott - Walking Tall), Jared and Sam show them what the clear blue sea has to offer.  Not only do they get some wondrous views of sharks and coral but they also come across two derelict wrecks and treasures they could never have imagined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The friends find a plane lying on the seabed, full of millions of dollars of cocaine and the precious artefacts of a sunken ship.  With greedy eyes, Bryce and Amanda are all for taking the stash and selling it on for a quick fix but Jared and Sam are more concerned with the historical find.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The young divers are not the only ones who have set their sights on the sunken treasures.  A group of money hungry criminals are also eyeing the stash and will do whatever it takes to get to it before the young divers do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coming from a lowly background, Jared has to toss up between a 'get rich quick' scheme or happiness and true love.  With the sexy Sam on his arm, surely that isn't a hard decision? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walker and Alba deliver convincing onscreen chemistry as the young couple in love.  Caan adds some excellent one liners and comedy while Scott is purely there to add some extra spice and even more bare flesh.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of the actors were required to master the art of free diving.  For Walker it was probably a breeze seeing as he is a lifelong surfer and free diver in his spare time and Alba also has a fair bit of diving experience from her role in TV show, The New Adventures of Flipper.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even with their aqua experience, I'm sure none of the actors found it particularly easy to adapt to filming the scenes with real-life sharks swimming around them.  Hats off to them for agreeing to it though, many would have opted for the easy way out by having awful computer-generated predators instead.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, but did I forget to mention that the movie was filmed in the sunny Bahamas?  What a hardship!  Guess that makes up for the scary shark scenes!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Into the Blue has gratuitous bare flesh flashing and totally unnecessary close up shots of bottoms and cleavage (although I'm sure the male viewers will disagree).  But the storyline is gripping, the action and violence is well timed and effective and the acting is sound.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, I must criticise this film for its sheer lack of originality.  It is puzzling as to why the movie makers did not feel it necessary to mention or credit the 1977 classic <i>The Deep</i> starring Nick Nolte and Robert Shaw. The stories in these two movies are so similar classic movie lovers will wonder why the studio didn't simply credit the earlier film. This is a side issue to be debated by film buffs.  Nevertheless I'm sure the target demographic will receive the movie well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watch this film if you are a fan of fun treasure hunter films like <i>Sahara</i>, <i>National Treasure</i> and, of course, <i><b>THE DEEP</b></i>.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	102	2011-03-26
105	1	20	\N	The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King	<p>After a long wait it is almost here, possibly the most eagerly anticipated DVD's of recent years, the final instalment of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Ring's Trilogy, The Return of the King Special Extended Edition. A long sentence but hopefully so over inflated as to hint at how important this DVD, this movie, really is. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>For anyone who has been living in a cave for the last decade, The Return of the King is the final chapter in the big screen adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's, The Lord of the Ring's saga. The books themselves tell a highly intricate story involving a whole menagerie of characters and it would be useless to try and tell it all here or even reduce it down to a few paragraphs. However, useless challenges happen to haunt me, I work in Insurance after all. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Set in the land of middle earth, a parallel to our dark ages, an evil sorcerer of great power named Sauron forged a magic ring of awesome power. After a short stab at global domination he was defeated when the ring was cut from his hand. Sadly the ring was soon lost by the heroic victors. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ring is evil, truly evil, and its power is seductive. Whoever wears the ring gains special powers proportionate to their own gifts. In the hands of a simple man the ring may make him invisible and give him heightened senses, however if you're an evil sorcerer you may take over the world and enslave all of mankind. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the initial defeat of Sauron the ring was lost for thousands of years. This epic tale begins when a young Hobbit named Frodo inherits a magic gold ring from his eccentric uncle while far away, in the dark land of Mordor, the spirit of Sauron has returned. It doesn't take long for Frodo's close friend Gandalf, a wizard, to connect these two distant events. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a series of adventures Frodo and a fellowship of nine friends and warriors set off on a seemingly impossible task, to take the ring into the heartland of the enemy and destroy it in the volcano where it was made. Soon after they set off on this quest, the fellowship gets separated by a sequence of events. The combined adventures of the remaining fellowship make up the saga. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Return of the King is the final chapter where the stories of the various characters finally converge in a climactic showdown with the armies of Sauron pressing on the remnant of mankind while in Mordor a small, near dead, Frodo struggles with his last scrap of life to get the ring into the volcano and save the world. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>To try and go into any more detail would make this review even lengthier. Rest assured there is a lot of action and adventure along the way and a very strong story line. Many have written books on the various sub plots and parables, the story of good and evil, the analogies that may be drawn but probably shouldn't. I could easily rant for a week or two (friends will confirm this) about the books and the movies. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most fans will agree that this final section of the story has the fastest pace and it definitely has some of the greatest battles and action sequences. As the story unfolds all the emotional subplots reach a pitch and by the end of the flick, some people may even shed a tear. This final movie in the franchise is wonderful. </p>\r\n<p>Despite being an undoubtedly great movie, upon its release many criticised the film for taking to long to end, or that the film didn't tie up all its loose ends. In retort, if you are trying to conclude a twelve hour epic you can't just give a ten minute sum up, you need to sort things through properly and if you've seen the extended editions of the first two movies you'd consider the theatrical version to be merely a taster for the true concluding chapter. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The special extended editions of the earlier two movies in the trilogy introduce further subplots that made each greater than their theatrical version. After watching the two earlier extended editions, the theatrical edition of the final movie could not possibly resolve all the story arcs and as such some may have felt a little dissatisfied. However with this final extended edition (extended by a colossal fifty minutes) these grumbles will hopefully be pacified. Hence the anticipation referred to earlier. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no question that the direction of the LOTR movies is brilliant. The attention to detail, character, artwork, pace and emotion has been present from the opening shot of the first movie and has remained consistent through to the final glimpse of a ship nearing a horizon. Likewise the acting has been above par for most fantasy movies and has kept people entertained to such a degree that they feel as if they are on the adventure, sharing the peril. In addition the special effects, sets and costumes are groundbreaking and beautiful taking us into a different world that feels as real and fragile as our own and includes some of the most thrilling battle sequences, awe inspiring landscapes and fearsome creatures ever put on screen. Finally, knitting the whole package together is one of the most moving and powerful movie musical scores of the last decade. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>These movies are more than your standard effects filled fantasy action movie, they are artistic and grand on a scale more akin to a David Lean epic than a George Lucas action opera. You may have guessed that I like these movies, I more than like them, I love them. They show more clearly than anything in recent years the scope for cinema to take you to a place impossible and fantastic. On screen they are five star gold entertainments while off screen they are a technical breakthrough in movie making and worthy of every award they finally received. </p>\r\n	5	2011-03-26	105	2011-03-26
106	1	20	\N	William Shakespeare: The Merchant of Venice	<p>William Shakespeare's the Merchant of Venice is a multi layered story of love and friendship, loss and revenge with a few bare breasts and a dose of cross dressing comedy thrown in for good measure.</p>\r\n<p>Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes - Killing Me Softly) is a young handsome lord living in Venice and very close friend to the wealthy merchant Antonio (Jeremy Irons - The Time Machine). At the beginning of the play Bassanio is in love with the beautiful Portia who has inherited a fortune from her late father. To win the heart and fortune of Portia, Bassanio must not only make a grand impression on the lovely lady but must also solve a riddle laid down by her late father.</p>\r\n<p>Sadly Bassanio is a little light and so he visits friend Antonio to try and borrow some cash so he may get himself glammed up and court the fair Portia. Antonio would do anything to help his close friend but alas his wealth is tied up in some cargo shipments. To solve the problem Antonio and Bassanio reluctantly visit the lowly but wealthy Jew, Shylock (Al Pacino - The Recruit) to see if he will grant a loan.</p>\r\n<p>It is important to note that at the time the play was written, Jews were loathed and derided by the Christian church. This is manifest in the non-existent relationship and mutual contempt between Antonio and Shylock. However the Shylock decides to rise above wounded pride and resentment. Shylock lends Antonio a large some of money for a set amount of time on the understanding that if the loan is not repaid at the end of that time, he may demand a pound of Antonio's flesh.</p>\r\n<p>While Bassanio is reluctant about the deal Antonio is confident his ships will arrive and restore his wallet sufficiently to pay off the loan. As Bassanio sets off to find love, Antonio waits for his ships. As you can imagine, things do not go to plan.</p>\r\n<p>Relative newcomer director Michael Radford has made a visually sumptuous film crammed with beautiful buildings, set pieces and costumes. He can be content that this movie feels authentic and can be confident that the movie will be a feather in his cap.</p>\r\n<p>Al Pacino as Shylock reminds the audience that he is in fact a great actor and those who feel he shouts too much will be pleased to note that although he is highly vocal in a few scenes, a majority of this film shows a more reflective and gentle voice in a good expression of a tired and frail but remorseless man. Similarly Jeremy Iron's smooth tones and graceful manner are present in the vulnerable Antonio, a man facing the knife.  However the star of the show must be Lynn Collins (13 Going on 30) who as the beautiful and intelligent Portia, lights up the screen with not only her beauty but well timed dialogue and the challenge of cross dressing. Indeed looking at the cast as a whole, Joseph Fiennes seems to be the weakest link in the chain as the dashing Bassanio. That is not to suggest he is a weak actor, far from it, but it appears the skills of the stage may be a little too expressive when placed on screen.</p>\r\n<p>In support there was surprisingly good performances from both Gregor Fisher (Love Actually) and John Sessions (Stella Street) as Antonio's fellow traders Solanio and Salerio and also the nominally madcap Kirs Marshall (Love Actually) as Bassanio's sidekick Gratiano.</p>\r\n<p>The lighting, art work, costumes and sets add realism to the movie and the visual impression is reminiscent of 'The Girl with a Pearl Earring' while by comparison the pace of this movie is more fluid and effort has been taken to get the feel and expression of each scene sincere to the mood of the play. This is an artistic movie and is well worth the attention of any Shakespeare fan.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	106	2011-03-26
107	1	20	\N	Garden State	<p>We all like to think that the world of the movies offers an escape from a banal reality but as is often the case, real life can be just as unexpected and insane as anything on the silver screen. Garden State, the new movie by first time writer and director Zach Braff, is a poignant look at real life with an element of humour both dark and satiric.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zach Braff plays Andrew Largeman, a struggling actor who returns to the roost to attend his mother's funeral and embarks on a personal voyage of rediscovery. On a visit to a doctor Andrew bumps into a free spirited young girl named Sam (Natalie Portman - Stars Wars) who sparks a feeling he hasn't known. Andrew is numb, raised by a strange family and trying to find himself through the blur of antidepressants, Sam is a ray of sunlight. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Andrew and Sam wander through town getting to know each other and visiting some of Andrew's old friends, we get to see many strange characters including a bored self made billionaire, a young waiter dressed as knight who sleeps with his friend's mother, and of course a friendly guide dog. As Andrew reassesses his life we learn about his past and engage with his character and the blooming romance with Sam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This movie isn't Shakespeare but has a healthy amount of off the wall humour and some great ideas. Considering this is a first step into writing and directing, Zach Braff has made a wonderful movie that can boast good acting and an engaging plot. Braff himself, most commonly known as inept Dr Dorian from TV comedy Scrubs, shows his more serious side and manages to flit effortlessly between comedy and thought provoking. Similarly Natalie Portman gives the movie some light and energy as Sam, a very different role from her dark childhood in Leon and her more recent iconic popcorn royalty status in the Star Wars franchise. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all this film has some great elements and despite dragging at times I felt it was very entertaining. To say it's a great comedy would be pushing my luck, after all everyone's taste in comedy is different. Saying that few would dispute that 'dodge the flaming arrow contest' is a moment of genius. The humour of Garden State is more deadpan than the more mainstream comedies and is may appeal to fans of TV's Six Feet Under or films such The Royal Tenenbaums. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I suspect this film may not send the box office manager out for support staff but in time good word of mouth and an Indie crowd may make it a DVD success.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	107	2011-03-26
109	1	16	\N	Crash	<p>Crash tells the story of interlocking situations surrounding the controversial topics of racism and stereotyping in Los Angeles.  The characters have to face and deal with the harsh realities of prejudice, corruption, crime and murder.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crash homes in on the lives of extremely different characters ranging from an upper class white couple, an inter-racial couple working as police detectives, two car jackers, a black TV director and his wife, a Mexican locksmith, a Persian shop owner, a rookie cop and a Korean couple.  The complete spectrum of racial backgrounds and the divides that come with that diversity are present in this film. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film centres round a series of crashes and collisions both physically and theoretically. Although the film has been advertised as dealing with issues of racism, this is not highly apparent but there is more of a deeper message on the issue of stereotyping and making rash judgements about certain cultural/ethnic groups. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crash gives the viewer a tough but harsh lesson in the consequences of quick judgement and the bleak reality of how prejudice can end up putting you in a life or death situation. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Writer/producer Paul Haggis has touched on the right emotions with the rich dialogue, sensitively balanced humour and gripping story lines.  The pace of the film builds up sufficient tension and the camera movement and direction helps to project the gritty real life situations. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don Cheadle (Ocean's Twelve) puts in an emotional performance as the accomplished Detective Graham Waters whose success goes unnoticed by his sick and distressed mother who thinks the world of his younger brother.  Matt Dillon (Herbie: Fully Loaded) is suitably cast as the sleazy and arrogant corrupt cop who, in his personal life, is struggling to deal with family heartache.  The story of locksmith Daniel (Michael Pena - Million Dollar Baby) is particularly poignant, as is Officer Hanson's (Ryan Phillippe - Gosford Park) regretful situation resulting from a mistaken snap decision.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watch this film if you like watching a web of stories running against the tide of the normal "beginning to end" film formats such as American Beauty and Magnolia.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	109	2011-03-26
110	1	20	\N	Sideways	<p>Following critical acclaim for Election (1999) and About Schmidt (2002), director and writer Alexander Payne paints yet another picture full of real people in curious situations. The satirical wit present in both earlier films is present once again as are a variety of rich characters and some great superb acting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Miles is a writer who is waiting anxiously for news of if his latest book is to be published while he recovers from a painful divorce. Miles need motivation in his life and his ray of hope, his treat, is a road trip with his friend and actor Jack through California's vineyards sampling wine and having a break from his stresses. However Jack, celebrating his last week of bachelorhood, has mildly different plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sophisticated and intellectual Miles can detect subtlety in wine and can discern the difference between the various types of grape. Meanwhile Jack's pallet, less refined, prefers to sample attractive single mothers and kinky fat waitresses. The polar relationship between Miles and Jack makes for a great cinematic double act, akin yet suitably dissimilar to that of the Dude and Walter in The Big Lebowski.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>What appears at first to be a meandering story line, similar to the characters' journey, slowly unfolds to reveal a careful and brilliant script. What you believe to be a dysfunctional buddy movie transpires in fact to be a great character piece as refreshing as the wine constantly swilled through the film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the lead character Miles, Paul Giamatti (American Splendor) excels himself once again and is worthy of an award or two. His portrayal of an intelligent man caught in the crossroads of life is deeply touching and by the end of the film you feel like he is a friend, a friend you care about and would like to see again. Meanwhile in comparison to the complex and subtle Miles, Thomas Haden Church is hilarious as the loud transparent dimwit Jack, hell bent on dipping his wick during his final days of freedom.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Along the way we also meet Virginia Madsen who is delightful as Maya, a wine lover and divorcee akin to Miles. Madsen has already received acclaim across the pond for her performance and adds a sexiness and romantic warmth to all her scenes, one to look out for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you like wine and can see the fine detail in things, this is a movie for you. It is sufficiently different from predecessors to remain fresh and blends comedy with genuine emotion to make a great movie. It may be too slow for the popcorn crowd but if you enjoyed films such as About Schmidt, Lost in Translation, The Big Lebowski or The Royal Tenenbaums, this flick should satisfy.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	110	2011-03-26
112	1	20	\N	Flight of the Phoenix	<p>A gang of dispirited oil workers decommission their well and climb into a cargo plane homeward bound across the barren waste of the Gobi Desert. With the oil well closed off, the roughnecks are faced with uncertainty about their jobs and are reluctant to board the plane. Little do they know that things are about to get a lot worse. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trying to fly around a sand storm, grizzled Captain Frank Towns (Dennis Quaid - In Good Company) battles in vain to keep the plane in the air while his passengers pray. The plane crashes and a few lives are lost, they may be the lucky ones. The remaining passengers and their pilots are left stranded in the middle of the desert, hundreds of miles off course and it is unlikely that any search party can save them. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the desperation of their plight sinks in an eccentric inventor, Elliott (Giovanni Ribisi - Sky Captain), a last minute addition to the passenger list, steps forward with a daring plan to save them from a slow death. Elliott believes the intact remnants of the crashed plane could be reassembled to form a new rudimentary plane that may fly them to safety. As with any brave plan there are risks, the work would be hard and further reduce their water rations and in the end the plane may not fly. Frank is dubious but reluctantly he has to concede that Elliott's superior intelligence may hold the key to saving the remaining passengers. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on the 1965 classic starring James Stewart (It's A Wonderful Life) and Richard Attenborough (The Great Escape), Flight of the Phoenix remains sincere to the original movie while making some minor updates. I am happy to say that the major plot points and character flaws are present and this is a great entertaining adventure of resourcefulness versus a desiccating environment. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>The power struggle between the cold mysterious inventor and the faithless captain that made the original film so tense is still in place and the importance of character is still the central theme of the movie. The chemistry between Quaid and Ribisi is not as fraught and emotive as the original pairing of James Stewart and Hardy Kruger yet still makes a desperate situation more intense. In particular Ribisi makes a good impression as the highly intelligent man who sets himself above the flock. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>A small physical frame and quirky behaviour make Elliott easy prey for a heavily built angry engineer, yet his intelligence is his real strength and he knows that without his knowledge they will all fail. He uses this power to play with the survivors, especially Towns, while building the plane. By comparison the character of Towns is fairly well trodden, a dispirited pilot hero who can see no hope for survival or will to live yet manages to turn around and help save the day. Quaid makes another good attempt delivering what is needed of him. He also shows that despite being fifty he can still have a six-pack and whoop arse if need be. </p>  \r\n\r\n<p>Miranna Otto (Lord of the Rings) appears to be assuming the role Lord Attenborough held in the original but has little script to make a real impact. Her performance as the only female cast member, admirable that it is, cannot compete with recent excellence as Eowyn in the LOTR films. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Helping to pad out the crew of rough necks Hugh Laurie (Stuart Little) is suitably reserved and self important as an executive with no practical skill thrown into the mix. With no talking mice to be seen, Laurie finally gets time to show an array of emotions such as bewilderment, resentment and in a particularly strong scene crazed desperation. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>Also making a good impact Kevork Malikyan (Indian and the Last Crusade) returns as a spiritual man who can find peace in the chaos and helps keep hope alive. Finally, Tony Curran (The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen), cursed with a career of bit parts, makes a great impact as a rough engineer prepared to do whatever it takes to keep the team moving. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>The rest of the crew mainly consists of pumped up muscles glistening with sweat or comic relief from the sidelined chef. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story in this film is simple and desperate forming the back drop for the human stories of the survivors and the power struggles between the various people key to the group's survival. This new sincere revamp of a classic makes refreshing change from other recent remakes that feel the need to change characters or add new dynamics. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a popcorn movie. Treat yourself to a drink and some ice cream and slap on your sun-block before you go in, this film is bright and hot and you'll want something to cool you down.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	112	2011-03-26
113	1	20	\N	Be Cool	<p>Ten years ago John Travolta, fresh from a career reviving performance in Pulp Fiction, arrived on screen as alpha male Chilli Palmer in the criminally underrated Get Shorty. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chilli is a cool character, unfazed by any situation thrown upon him. A combination of sharp wit, positive perspective and one hundred percent confidence, Chilli has tough guy presence and yet a calm cool style all his own. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 'Get Shorty' Chilli Palmer, a shylock working for the mob, arrives in LA to collect a debt from a failing horror director and falls in love with the movie industry. After a hilarious web of stories and set ups, Chilli manages to sever his connection with the mob and establish himself as a premier movie producer. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ten years later and we get to revisit Chilli Palmer in 'Be Cool'.  Starting to get tired of movies, Chilli needs a new source of inspiration. After a friend and music producer is gunned down while having a cup of coffee, Chilli honours the dying man's wish to visit struggling singer Linda Moon (Christina Milian - Torque). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Linda has dreams of a singing career but is tied by contract to wannabe gangster Raji (Vince Vaughn - Dodgeball) and his camp bodyguard Elliott (The Rock - Walking Tall). At the same time Chilli's friend and recent widow Edie (Uma Thurman - Kill Bill) is trying to keep her record label afloat despite the unwanted interest of the Russian mafia and a gang of gangster rappers. Can Chilli bring these two together and save the day? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a menagerie of secondary characters each with their own little stories, this film has a lot of talent on screen and enough cameos to keep the sharp-eyed amused. Harvey Keitel, Cedric the Entertainer, Andre 3000 and James Woods all pop up at one time or another along with a few other familiar faces unnamed to maintain the surprise. Sadly the wealth of talent proves too burdensome and the film suffers for it. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The large number of minor story arcs all overlapping and weaving together is entertaining but at times feels slow. We have an idea where things may be going but it's taking too long to get there. On the upside, each of the actors give great performances ranging from John Travolta's cool Chilli all the way down to Andre 3000's trigger happy rapper. Of particular note is Uma Thurman who combines good delivery of comedy with some subtle yet well acted moments of grace. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The soundtrack is great, the cast is wonderful and the comedy is well timed. Sadly the story feels like a direct rehash of 'Get Shorty' and the over convoluted plot becomes a little tiresome. I really enjoyed the film but sadly it did not exceed expectations. If you liked the predecessor you'll be entertained and if you are a music fan you'll enjoy the sounds. If for nothing else watch it just to see Travolta and Thurman dance together for the first time since Jack Rabbit Slims.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	113	2011-03-26
115	1	20	\N	Oceans Twelve	<p>When a big film is due to come out at the cinema, the other movie studios will either release their own film to compete or leave it a week or two to calm down. Last week we saw a four sided show off between the high action <I>Assault on Precinct 13</i>, the big name comedy <i>Meet the Fockers</i>, the intellectual comedy <i>Sideways</i> and subterranean horror <i>Crap</i>, sorry I mean <i>Creep</i>. Nearly every genre got a look in but the Fockers probably took the payroll. So what came out this week? </p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Ocean's Twelve</i>, all star sequel to the super cool all star heist movie of similar name, and <i>Racing Stripes</i>, a comedy about a zebra with dreams of being a race horse. Does the lack of competition this week suggest that the studios really believe Racing Stripes is that good? Poor joke but it really does look like a one horse race. Sorry, that's an even worse joke. Back to the subject...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2001, director Steven Soderbergh (Out of Sight) brought to the screens possibly one of the best crime capers of recent years and rejuvenated the heist movie genre. If that movie lacked originality on the story side, it certainly made up for it in style, character and comedy. Ocean's 11 was a huge hit and spawned a menagerie of lesser duplicates. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>George Clooney (The Perfect Storm) as Danny Ocean along with Brad Pitt (Fight Club) as his friend Rusty, had a great onscreen buddy relationship that made the robbery plausible fun while Andy Garcia (Confidence) was perfectly icy as villainous casino boss Benedict, their target. With the aid of a ten man team of conmen, gymnasts and technical professionals, Danny Ocean and co nabbed a cool $165 million from Benedict and also reclaimed an ex-wife, another of Benedict's prized possessions. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roll the clock on three years and the team have scattered and are living life easy but no sequel would be needed if this was a happy ever after. Benedect is vengeful and with a handy tip off he now knows who the thieves are and where they are hiding. He doesn't want much, just repayment of everything stolen plus a high rate of interest all within two weeks. With such a simple task before them, the team must reunite and come up with a high paid plan and fast. To make things worse, an old flame from Rusty's past has caught wind of a caper and is intent on taking the whole crew to jail. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can't say much more without giving away details of the numerous plot points and ploys that you'd expect in this kind of duck and dive heist flick. Is it any good? Recent reviews have been less than vocal about this film despite the wealth of talent it contains. I would agree that this film seems less action packed than its predecessor but the story is a little more complicated this time round and Soderbergh has tried to take the crew in a new direction. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ocean's Eleven had a team of thieves attempting an audacious heist with a romantic sideline and a dose of comedy. This time the robbery is a necessity rather than a challenge and the romance is definitely more bittersweet. The characters that were playful and in it for the money last time round are now fighting for freedom from an angry villain and under that pressure an excess of comedy would probably feel misplaced. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the stars have returned and the chemistry between the characters is still present even if the setting is slightly different and a few new faces have been thrown in to the mix to spice things up. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon (The Bourne Supremacy) remain centre stage, running the con along with accomplices Elliot Gould (Ocean's Eleven), Don Cheadle (After the Sunset), Bernie Mac (Bad Santa) and Julia Roberts (Closer) to name but a few. Meanwhile newcomer Catherine Zeta Jones (Chicago) adds excitement as a dogged Interpol agent and Vincent Cassel (Brotherhood of the Wolf) adds to the trouble as a cat like master thief. All of these stars put in a good turn but in a complex story full of twists and side stories, nobody gets enough time to really shine out. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story itself is more complicated than in Ocean's Eleven and may require a second screening. After one viewing I felt content that this film was good fun and should hit the mark for most punters. The film is a little less playful than Ocean's Eleven but personally I think it benefits from taking a new direction. The movie is still stylish and quite sharp with great clothes and concepts even if people may feel the story is wandering. Will there be an Ocean's 13? Anything is possible but the cocktail of talent may taste bland third time round. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you like crime capers, cons, plot twists, big names, stylish clothes, an element of romance, swanky settings, gadgets and cameo comedy, then this is the movie for you. </p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	115	2011-03-26
116	1	15	\N	Elektra	<p>Two years ago, in one of the least celebrated comic book film adaptations, Ben Affleck starred as the blind crime fighter, Daredevil. In between being upstaged by a villainous Colin Farrell and looking silly in red leather, Daredevil managed to spend some time romancing Greek assassin Elektra, a character who made as much of an impression as the rest of a distinctly average film.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Now Elektra, an unnecessary spin off, has arrived at a cinema screen near you to try and follow in the footsteps of X-Men and Spider-Man and achieve the success that Daredevil did not. Rather curiously however the creative forces behind the film have made a concerted effort to cut all ties with its parent film. The reason for this is either that they wished the film to be accessible to those who had never seen Daredevil or, more likely, they did not wish to be associated with their predecessor's relative failure.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>This decision turns out to be a great miscalculation. The 2005 version of the character of Elektra has little in common with the wealthy crime boss' daughter seen on screen in 2003. Instead of taking up weapons just to avenge her father's death, now Elektra is simply a cold blooded assassin for hire. Her latest target is Abbey Miller (Kirsten Prout - The Love Crimes of Gillian Guess), a gifted teenager who is so annoying I would have bumped her off for free. Elektra, it turns out, is more charitable than I, and decides to protect her from a rival gang of killers called the Hand.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Terence Stamp (The Haunted Mansion) pops up as Elektra's wise old Kung Fu mentor, a man who goes by the ludicrous name of Stick but still expects people to take him seriously (apparently Stick is not related to the wise old Kung Fu teaching rat Splinter from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles). Stamp seems to be under the impression that by talking very slowly and very clearly gives his dialogue some gravitas when in reality it's just pretentious nonsense.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Jennifer Garner is visually striking throughout the film but despite proving to be a very charismatic actress in last year's romantic comedy 13 going on 30, here she fails to rise above the turgid material. Goran Visnjic (television's ER) plays Abbey's father, Mark, a widower and prospective love interest for our corseted heroine. He is wasted however by the script writers who, having obviously failed to come up with a convincing scenario to set up a romance between the two, decide to ditch poor Goran for almost the entire second half of the film.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The fight scenes are reasonably well choreographed but make poor comparisons to sequences seen in recent Chinese films like Hero and The House of Flying Daggers. Certainly a complete lack of tension during Elektra's battles against the agents of the Hand doesn't help. The film is overcrowded with villains, so much so that although some do seem superficially interesting such as Tattoo, whose body art comes to life and Typhoid Mary, a young lady who has an adverse effect on the health of those nearby, none of them get enough screen time to allow them to become truly menacing adversaries.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Elektra's attempt at reinventing itself as an independent franchise fails on almost all counts. It repeats the mistakes of Daredevil by putting all its emphasis into the action set pieces without bothering to create a lead character with some personality, someone who would actually be watchable in the scenes when she wasn't just stabbing people in the back.</p>\r\n\r\n	2	2011-03-26	116	2011-03-26
117	1	20	\N	The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou	<p>Captain Steve Zissou (Bill Murray - Lost in Translation) is a once revered oceanographer who, along with his team of professional documentary makers, sails the seas aboard his research vessel, the Belafonte. On one fateful mission his closest friend was killed by a rare and unclassified species of shark nicknamed the leopard shark (owing to its spots). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou follows the madcap adventure as the egocentric icon, determined to avenge his friend's death, mounts an expedition to locate and kill the shark. However overcoming the questionable motives of the captain are merely one hurdle, the expedition soon runs into all manner of obstacles including a Kentuckian pilot claiming to be a long lost son, a heavily pregnant yet polite journalist, insane pirates, jealous rivals and of course, utter incompetence. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the mind of Wes Anderson comes another great character comedy crammed with wry wit and an uncertain narrative. As with his earlier film The Royal Tenenbaums (2001), Anderson once again fills this movie with a menagerie of eccentric characters and set pieces that, although not classically comical, still create a slightly surreal world we can almost relate to and may even like to visit. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bill Murray returns to the screen with another great performance that steals the show, despite some excellent support from a cast to kill for. Reminiscent of his self confident characters in Stripes and Ghostbusters, Murray's dry wit and confident delivery make this a career highlight following his impressive yet deeper turn in Lost in Translation. Murray's self-assured comedy hero combined with Anderson's twisted humour makes for a great combination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Popping aboard to join the adventure Cate Blanchett (The Aviator) takes a side step away from seriousness to show her lighter side as Jane, a pregnant English reporter and childhood Zissou fan. Aboard the ship, Jane soon gets caught in a love triangle between the wanted affections of wannabe Zissou son Ned (Owen Wilson) and the unwanted attention of aged Zissou. Her minor eccentricities are very attractive and her delivery is perfect. Owen Wilson as Ned Plimpton, similarly steps away from his usual persona (cheeky sidekick as demonstrated in recent hits like Starsky and Hutch) to play an idealistic, if nave, pilot trying to work out if he really is the son of Zissou. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outside the love triangle there are yet more eccentric support characters to make the situation even more absorbing. Angelica Houston (Daddy Day Care) is suitably chilly as the intellectually superior wife Eleanor Zissou, who chain smokes her way through lavish sets and hunky interns. Jeff Goldblum (Igby Goes Down) as Alistair Hennessey camps things up big time as a wealthy rival with swanky clothes and a crew of elite clones while Zissou must content himself with Willem Dafoe (Spider-Man 2) as Klaus, an insecure ever faithful if territorial German assistant. Finally a brief mention should also be reserved for acting master Michael Gambon (The Layer Cake) as a darling banker who while trying to secure Zissou funding, tries to keep one step ahead of customs officials trying to snatch his visa.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>From the cross section set of the Belafonte to the acoustic Portugese David Bowie soundtrack and beautiful locations, this is a mellow cruise both well directed and well shot. The cast of individually unique, comical and eccentric characters, combined with the screwball documentary premise, fuse to give this film a style that sets it apart from the pack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The jokes in this film are not always obvious and that is what I really like about it. I can't pin a description down to help, itself another plus point. The only real comparators that spring to mind would are The Royal Tenenbaum's, I Heart Huckabees or Napoleon Dynamite. If you liked any of those films you must go and watch this one as it's a classic. I have ranted for long enough. Go see this movie, enjoy it and with your support hopefully they'll make more films of this calibre.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	117	2011-03-26
118	1	12	\N	House of Flying Daggers	<p>The year is 859AD, the end of the Tang Dynasty, and the Emperor of China has grown weak, his government corrupt. A group of revolutionaries known as the House of Flying Daggers has been openly attacking the corrupt government, and have perservered in spite of the assassination of their leader. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two captains of Feng Tian Province, Leo (Andy Lau - <i>Infernal Affairs</i>) and Jin (<i>Takeshi Kaneshiro - Chungking Express</i>) are given 10 days in which to find the group's new leader. Their only lead is the blind dancer Mei (Zhang Ziyi - <i>Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon</i>), who they suspect is the old leader's missing daughter. Jin and Leo concoct a plan to gain the girl's trust and discover the whereabouts of the new leader: Jin will pose as a sympathetic wanderer who rescues Mei from imprisonment, and she in turn will lead him to the rest of the House of Flying Daggers. But in doing so, Jin falls for Mei and finds himself trapped between love and duty. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every so often, an over-hyped and/or eagerly awaited film will have an unrealistic standard demanded of it that cannot possibly be met, one that diminishes enjoyment in spite of the film's actual worth. <i>House of Flying Daggers</i> looked set to be an example of this, following on from the critical acclaim awarded to Zhang Yimou's previous <i>wuxia</i> epic, <i>Hero</i>. Unfortunately <i>House of Flying Daggers</i> not only fails to meet high expectations but it falls far short of the standard set by its predecessor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The premise of the film suggests something with the flair of <i>Hero</i> but with a more compelling story. The first hour plays out this assumption, with the introduction of the star-crossed lovers, and the set-piece of Mei's dance in the opulent set of the Peony Pavilion brothel. This is immediately followed by her demonstration of the "echo" game, whereby Leo flicks peanuts at a series of drums surrounding Mei and she must strike the correct drum with the long sleeves of her dress, a wonder that draws an audience of all the other clients and dancers in the brothel, all bedecked in lavish, colourful costumes. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zhang Ziyi gets to demonstrate her childhood dancing skills, her martial arts, and further proof that she can actually act, something she couldn't be accused of in any of her films since <i>Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon</i> (with the notable exception of <i>2046</i>). In addition, there is a chemistry between her and Takeshi Kaneshiro that draws in the viewer in a way that wasn't possible with the more poised relationship of <i>Hero</i>'s Flying Snow and Broken Sword. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first slip into melodrama is forgiveable, as Jin is forced to kill his own men in order to remove doubts from Mei's mind, and Leo's exaggerated response is justified later on in the film. Then comes the film's highlight, a stunning bamboo forest battle featuring simultaneous action on the ground and in the air. But then it starts to go a little awry. The first twist comes, and then a second trips over the first in a headlong rush to confound the audience. At this point a feeling of deja vu sets in, as the plot starts to strongly resemble that of another Andy Lau film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of whom, Andy Lau's lead billing is puzzling considering he has little more than a supporting role. Admittedly, he is obliged to play it straight for most of his scenes, but when he does get to cut loose he chews the scenery so gratuitously that the risk of catastrophic deforestation in the Ukraine seemed a very real possibility. Thinking about it, he didn't really emote all that much in <i>Infernal Affairs</i> and came across very well. Perhaps there's a lesson to be learned here for Mr Lau...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Redemption for the film is offered in the form of a tantalisingly brief scene which suggests the possibility of the final duel being played out as a microcosm of the greater battle between the House of Flying Daggers and the Emperor's army. For reasons that will no doubt remain a secret, Yimou passes up this opportunity (he probably ran out of money), and instead presents a long, drawn out fight that has none of the grace of the earlier duels, and gets more and more ridiculous with each passing moment. By the time the end credits roll, it's a blessed relief.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>To be fair, <i>Hero</i> has its pretentious moments too, but that film focused on more intellectual concerns than <i>House of Flying Daggers</i>, and by and large the sheer extravagance carried it through. <i>House of Flying Daggers</i> does feature a more structured narrative linking the beautiful with the martial and the drama, it's just not a particularly good one. Special attention should be drawn to language used in the film; I can't make any comment about the original Mandarin dialogue, but the sub-titles in certain scenes can only be described as preposterous. I know this is set about 1200 years ago, but did people really speak like that, especially between equals?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yimou has said in interviews that he was attempting to subvert the traditions of the <i>wuxia</i> genre, where individual desires are often sacrificed for the greater good of the community, a possible reflection of the ideals imposed by Communist rule. In this film, the main characters sacrifice everything else for love, but in such a ludicrous manner that tragedy becomes farce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, get the DVD, watch the first hour and the bamboo forest scene, and then turn it off. Trust me, you'll come away feeling less disappointed and far less traumatised. Yimou has said that he will be working on a third <i>wuxia</i> epic now that he has hit his stride. Let's just hope that he avoids plundering other films for ideas and concentrates on something more like <i>Hero</i> and less like this film.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	118	2011-03-26
120	1	16	\N	Pride & Prejudice	<p>In a retelling of the Jane Austen novel, Keira Knightley (The Jacket) stars in the latest film adaptation of the classic tale, Pride & Prejudice. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Knightley plays Elizabeth Bennet, a young and intelligent girl who comes from a humble background and shares a house with her parents and four sisters. Mrs Bennet (Brenda Blethyn - On a Clear Day) has her heart set on marrying off all her daughters one-by-one to wealthy eligible bachelors while her husband (Donald Sutherland - Cold Mountain) takes a more laidback approach to affairs of the heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When news arrives that the wealthy Mr Bingley (Simon Woods - Charles II [TV]) is in town, Mrs Bennet sets about making sure her daughters are on display at the local ball in the hope that one of the girls will capture his attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the ball, Mr Bingley becomes smitten by the eldest daughter, Jane (Rosamund Pike - Die Another Day), to the horror of his snobby sister, Caroline (Kelly Reilly -Dead Bodies) while Elizabeth catches the eye of his stuffy friend, Mr Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen - Spooks [TV].</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elizabeth and Mr Darcy could not be from more different worlds and they get off to a shaky start with a love-hate relationship.  Meanwhile, the next suitor is waiting in line and Elizabeth tries her best to reject the advances of drippy Mr Collins (Tom Hollander - Paparazzi).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the path of love never runs smoothly and Jane is heartbroken when Mr Bingley leaves town without a word.  Elizabeth's situation gets even more complicated when she meets debonair military man, Mr Wickham (Rupert Friend - The Libertine), who shares an ugly past with the Darcy family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If that wasn't enough, a family scandal involving Lydia Bennet and the interfering and pretentious nature of Mr Collin's benefactor, Lady Catherine de Bourg (Ladies in Lavender) causes no end of trouble for the Bennet family and the girls' happiness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Knightley was cast well as outspoken Elizabeth with a sharp tongue, flawless spoken English and the perfect "English Rose" complexion.  MacFadyen was suitably cold and pompous as Mr Darcy but failed to wow the female audience as Colin Firth had successfully done so in the TV adaptation.  Special mention must go to Blethyn as the over-eager mother and to Sutherland as the loving father.  Dench was also superb at delivering the filthiest glances and most degrading remarks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pride & Prejudice keeps true to the Jane Austen novel and its language has been retained in the film.  Fans of the Bollywood-style take on the book, Bride & Prejudice, will notice some similarities in the story, characters and the use of original dialogue.  Fans of period dramas/films such as Sense & Sensibility and Emma are bound to enjoy this film.</p>	3	2011-03-26	120	2011-03-26
121	1	15	\N	Team America: World Police	<p>When sinister terrorists armed with weapons of mass destruction threaten the world with complete annihilation the United States turns to a crack unit of marionettes to stop the enemies of freedom, using any means possible. Sound ridiculous? Don't worry, Team America: World Police is. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>The utterly bonkers duo behind the subversive animated comedy South Park, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, have trained their sights on the shoot -first-ask-questions-later American right, the weak kneed liberal left and the fickle world of Hollywood to lampoon in their latest bad taste extravaganza. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Armed with the Quentin Tarantino guide to film swearing, a bucket of butchers scraps, puppet sex and an eye for detail the movie seems to have been specifically designed to enrage the entire political spectrum, conservative film sensors, and traditionalist Stingray fans. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Sophisticated wit clearly wasn't the brand of humour most popular in the Stone and Parker households. Still it's hard to be a snob about toilet humour and bad language when the scene that had me laughing hardest was when the drunken lead puppet repeatedly projectile vomits in a back alleyway. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>The spot-on dissection of the typical all American action movie set piece gets the film off to a flying start in Paris where the French capital is threatened, not only by terrorists but also by the gun-ho members of Team America. The ridiculous caricature of a skipping, singing French school boy and his encounter with the Bin Laden look-a-like proves that yes, puppets are silly, but in imaginative hands they can create a very entertaining cinema experience. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>The puppets and sets are superbly modelled and exquisitely detailed. As the Eiffel Tower comes crashing down during the opening scene, I fully expected Thunderbird Two to come swooping down to rescue the survivors of the catastrophe. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>The directors should be applauded for achieving what must have been a hugely challenging task. So impressive is the puppetry at times that the film actually benefits from short periods of wonder from the audience rather than another puerile joke. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Obviously creating a picture that immersed the viewer in its world however was never the intention of the filmmakers and the constant overblown parody becomes tiresome relatively quickly although the film has enough comedy variations to keep the audience entertained. The sight gags are inventive (where else can you see Sean Penn being mauled by a 'Puma') and the genius of lines like "There is no I in Team America" speak for themselves. </p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Finally the film is littered with catchy musical numbers such as "Freedom isn't Free" and most amusingly "America - F**k Yeah," which, while lyrically not particularly ground breaking, is still a hundred times better than any of the songs in Andrew Lloyd Webbers' The Phantom of the Opera.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	121	2011-03-26
122	1	15	\N	Andrew Lloyd Webber: The Phantom of the Opera	<p>Admittedly before I begin this review of Andrew Lloyd Webbers' The Phantom of the Opera I must first admit that the genre of film musicals is not among my favourites and that this is a film that will divide opinion equally between those who will love the movie and those who will hate it. I fell into the latter category. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>If you are not one of the tens of millions of people who have taken the time to watch the stage version, The Phantom of the Opera revolves around a shadowy figure that haunts the nineteenth century Paris Opera House. This masked recluse who lives in the theatres' subterranean passageways takes a particular interest in Christine, a talented young chorus girl, who the Phantom decides to train in the ways of opera. When brash diva Carlotta (Minnie Driver - Good Will Hunting) refuses to make way for his protg, the Phantom decides to advance Christine's career by more direct methods. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Obviously the lonely freak in the basement takes more than a little shine to the porcelain beauty of Christine but just as she seems to be succumbing to his charms her childhood sweetheart arrives on the scene. Raul has things the Phantom can never possess - wealth, nobility, a face that looks good from more than one angle. Clearly a war for Christine's heart must be waged, a war that involves more than a little singing. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Neither Emmy Rossum (The Day After Tomorrow) nor Gerard Butler (Dear Frankie) in the two lead roles, are going to break into Hollywood's major league on the back of performances that amount to little more than two hours of goldfish lip synching to the camera.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Ignoring the acting, the costume and set designs are certainly sumptuous but like director Joel Schumacher's previous crime against cinema, Batman and Robin, there might be plenty to keep your eyes busy up on the screen, but if you keep concentrating long enough you will be driven to jittery insanity. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>In Schumacher's defence, the director is not the principal villain of the horror that is The Phantom of the Opera. Having never experienced the talent of Andrew Lloyd Webber before, I can safely say I would be eternally grateful if I am never again subjected to anymore of his music. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>The lyrics include such gems as, "Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind." Poetic genius? You decide. </p> \r\n \r\n<p>The songs drone on incessantly, seemingly without end. Each one sounds exactly the same as the last although I did have a suspicion that each successive tune was getting gradually duller. A little bit of dialogue here and there would have gone a long way to ease the persistent ringing in my ears. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>The Phantom, once his mask is finally removed proves to be hideously disappointing. He turns from a cape swishing dude into a whiney loser with moderately bad eczema. Instead of a stomach churning disfigurement to match Gary Oldman's appearance in Hannibal, the Angel of Music simply has unkempt hair and a couple of lumps. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Finally answers on a postcard as to why, in a film set in Paris, is Miranda Richardson the only actor forced to put on a French accent?</p>	1	2011-03-26	122	2011-03-26
123	1	15	\N	Dear Frankie	<p>If phrases such as tear jerking or heart rendering combined with plots concerning long lost fathers or deaf children tend to make you reach for the nearest sick bag, then director Shona Auerbach's debut film Dear Frankie would seem on the surface to have little to recommend itself to your particular tastes. Luckily for weak stomached viewers however this exceptional drama manages to be touching without ever becoming cloying or overly sentimental.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Lizzie Morrison (Emily Mortimer - The Kid) and her young son Frankie have just arrived in a Scottish seaside town, the latest in a succession of moves that Lizzie subjects her son to whenever she feels her abusive husband is close to finding them. Frankie, too young to remember his violent father, has been told that his dad is actually a sailor on board the cargo ship Accra, which is on a long worldwide voyage.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Frankie keeps in contact with his dad thanks to regular letters, but little does he realise that it is in fact his mother who is writing the replies. Lizzie's plan comes unstuck however when Frankie discovers that the Accra is due to arrive at the local port in a matter of days. Now she must decide whether to reveal the truth to Frankie about his father or attempt to maintain the charade with the help of an impostor.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Dear Frankie is a film of simple pleasures. As the boy discovers the fun that can be had by skipping stones or going out for ice cream with his 'dad' for the first time, we the audience share his delight. It doesn't rely on spectacle, instead it is a picture that's strength lies in strong performances delivered from a good script.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Emily Mortimer fuses together the vulnerability that is at the heart of Lizzie's character with the strength and scepticism which her circumstances demand. Gerard Butler (Timeline) is a revelation as the quiet stranger who is hired to pretend to be Frankie's father. After several years of appearing in forgettable rubbish (Dracula 2000, Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life), Butler shows he has real talent and charisma. Hopefully he can follow up this film with more roles that actually require him to act.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Despite being a feel-good movie, the story manages to confound expectations allowing the audience to leave the cinema pleasantly surprised by a film that refuses to become predictable schmaltz.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	123	2011-03-26
124	1	16	\N	Without a Paddle	<p>Three teen flick comedy sidekicks have been brought together in a grown-up version of a 'Goonies' crossed with 'Deliverance' style adventure.  Dan (Seth Green - Austin Powers), Jerry (Matthew Lilliard - Scream) and Tom (Dax Shepard - Cheaper by the Dozen) are an unlikely bunch of friends.  Dan is a super successful yet super paranoid doctor, Jerry is stuck in an unfulfilling city job and John concocts tales of leading a glamorous salesman life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a long time apart, the three friends are reunited at the funeral of their fourth friend and adventure seeker Billy. While reminiscing Dan, Jerry and Tom come across a secret box in the old gang's tree-house, full of some of their most prized possessions and a more recent treasure map drawn by their lost friend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The three friends realise that the Goonies-style treasure map must have been left for them by their dead friend and that they must take up the challenge to find DB's lost treasure as a mark of respect to Billy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dan, Jerry and Tom brave treacherous waters, an aggressive grizzly bear and beat hypothermia to reach their goal.  But as with all your typical adventure movies, the lads meet some interesting characters along the way, namely some hot hippie girls and a pair of ugly gun toting hillbillies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As mentioned earlier the premise for the story is closely reminiscent of the search for One Eyed Willy's treasure in The Goonies mixed with the midlife crisis drama of Deliverance all mixed up with the screwball comedy of Road Trip. Without a paddle is a feel-good comedy with some hilarious scenes and much of the humour being provided by the less well-known actor Dax Shepard as the overly confident wild child. Also watch out for a cameo appearance from screen legend Burt Reynolds (Deliverance) as a strange yeti-type hermit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you liked teen comedies like American Pie, Road Trip, Euro Trip or Old School then this film will definitely appeal to you.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	124	2011-03-26
125	1	16	\N	Closer	<p>Closer, directed by Mike Nichols, tells the tale of a tangled web of love, lust, deceit and betrayal.  The film centres on chance meetings and finding love in the most unlikely of circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jude Law (I Heart Huckabees) plays writer and aspiring novelist Dan who is stuck in the "Siberia" of journalism writing obituaries for a newspaper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On his way to work one day, Dan spots a light and beautiful girl walking toward him mixed in with the mass of commuters. Alice (Natalie Portman - Garden State), an adult entertainer by trade, is literally knocked off her feet when she sets eyes on Dan and he is instantly mesmerised by her free-spirited and genuine nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But love never runs smoothly as most of us know.  While Dan gets some publicity shots for his new novel he becomes smitten with his photographer, Anna (Julia Roberts - Mona Lisa Smile) who is both successful and older than his current girlfriend, Anna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His interest soon turns into obsession and in a bid to grab Anna's attention, and also some much needed publicity for his book, Dan meddles in a spot of internet flirting to set up a meeting between two strangers.  The two strangers happen to be sex-crazed dermatologist Larry (Clive Owen - King Arthur) and the unsuspecting Anna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film concentrates on the emotional rollercoaster of the two couples and the opportunities at which their paths cross.  The film evokes every emotion possible in the characters involved ranging from jealousy, intimacy, intuition and pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The script in Closer is sensational with some really hard-hitting emotional scenes but with a little too much sexual dialogue and bad language for my liking, although this adds to the authenticity of the various situations the characters find themselves in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The roles of the supporting actors, Portman and Owen, far outweigh the performances of the apparent lead stars, Roberts and Law.  Portman should be commended for her emotional and heartfelt performance while Owen puts in a memorable and convincing performance as an enraged yet somewhat calm and calculating husband seeking revenge.  Owen definitely steals the show in this movie although the male audience may be drawn more to the beauty and near nudity of Portman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You will love this film if you enjoy watching real-life drama and domestic strife.  Watch this film if you enjoyed Sliding Doors, Unfaithful or Love Actually.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	125	2011-03-26
126	1	16	\N	40 Year Old Virgin	<p>Funny man Steve Carell (Bewitched) is on top form again as geeky bicycle-riding virgin Andy after entertaining us no end in Anchorman and Bruce Almighty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Andy is pretty much a nobody at the electronics store he works at.  His typical weekend involves playing computer games, collecting superhero figures or making egg sandwiches.  Most of his co-workers consider him either a geek or a freak, some even fear he might be a serial killer!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To Andy's surprise, the "cool clique" at work invites him to leave behind his dismal existence for one night and join them in a game of poker.  Cal (Seth Rogen - Anchorman), David (Paul Rudd - Anchorman) and Jay (Romany Malco - Churchill: The Hollywood Years) find out that not only is Andy a dark horse on the poker table but he is also harbouring another secret.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it finally "comes out" that Andy is in fact a virgin all hell breaks loose on the shop floor.  The usual monotonous work ethic goes haywire as all of Andy's co-workers start throwing jibes left, right and centre.  Everyone is in on the act, even his scary spiky-haired boss Paula (Jane Lynch - Lemony Snicket).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cal, Dave and Jay make it their lifelong mission to get Andy laid.  From speed dating to transsexual prostitutes, there is nothing they won't try in their quest to get Andy some action!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Andy, on the other hand, has plans of his own after setting his sights on a pretty customer Trish (Catherine Keener - The Interpreter) who works across the road in the ebay shop.  She too is hiding a secret but how will Trish react to Andy's lack of experience in the bedroom?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carell is absolutely fantastic in his first leading role.  He really has comedy down to a fine art.  Extra praise must go to Carell, if the rumours are true, that he volunteered to have his chest hair waxed for real in the film.  If it's true, guys and gals everywhere should bow down to him.  He is a god!  That's true dedication and commitment!  This is also one of the funniest scenes in the film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anchorman co-stars Rudd and Rogen put in great comedy sidekick performances.  Other support on the comedy side comes from Malco who delivers some excellent filthy dialogue and wise cracking lines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 40 Year Old Virgin is an absolutely hilarious movie.  It had me (and the entire cinema) in stitches of laughter.  There are some cracking one-liners in this movie and the comedy scenes are classic.  Watch it if you liked The Wedding Crashers, Anchorman or American Pie.  Warning: beware, this film might actually make your sides split!  A must-have DVD purchase for moi!</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	126	2011-03-26
128	1	20	\N	Million Dollar Baby	<p>Set in the world of boxing, Million Dollar Baby at first glance appears to be a clich fight movie with a young rookie learning from the wise but failing legend as they reach for the championship. However every time you feel you know where it is going, Million Dollar Baby takes a new direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank - The Core) is a determined fighter. Unskilled but passionate she attends the training gym each night in the hope of gaining the support and guidance of the owner, an ageing boxing coach named Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood - Blood Work). Sadly Frankie has no time for a new protg. He is tired and his tortured past fills him with doubt about his abilities.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>In the gym, Frankie is assisted by his lifelong friend and former fighter Eddie 'Scrap-Iron' Dupris (Morgan Freeman - Bruce Almighty) who helps the students find their feet and keeps the place clean and tidy. It is Eddie who first notices the potential of young Maggie and who allows her a chance to train in the gym with or without the approval of grizzled old Frank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Million Dollar Baby follows the stories of both Maggie and Frank as they find each other and form a lasting friendship while fighting to make something of their lives and to gain recognition and respect in a fierce sport that takes no prisoners. Narrated by the character Eddie, the movie follows the well-trodden path of former boxing classics then takes a side step into a new direction, sometimes humorous, sometimes dark. The narration is perfect and the pace, although gentle, allows the story to slowly gain a massive momentum.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Hollywood veterans Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman give first class performances, reuniting for the first time sine 1992's Unforgiven. Morgan's distinctive voice and narrative, reminiscent of 'The Shawshank Redemption' adds depth to the story and a third perspective to this character study.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Clint gives an especially good performance as a man facing painful memories and some of the most emotionally charged decisions to be seen in a big screen movie for some considerable time. Indeed Clint, as director, deserves further recognition for his work behind the lens.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Million Dollar Baby is a dark movie that tells a powerful story. As mentioned earlier you can be forgiven for feeling the early scenes are familiar, especially the eager rookie and grumpy coach grating off one another. This slow introduction actually allows you to connect a little with the main characters before the real story kicks in. The camera style for the world of boxing is often dark with shadows obscuring the heads of people standing just out of the light, glimpses of silhouette boxers and conversations in darkened changing rooms. Meanwhile, the few scenes in the world outside are nearly always shown as bright sunshine or flood lit arena. The contrast may be intentional or just a means to balance the movie but the darkness forces the audience to concentrate on the dialogue rather than be distracted by sets or costumes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Credit to Clint aside, on screen it soon becomes apparent that Hilary Swank has put in a massive effort to physically fill the shoes of Maggie Fitzgerald and her muscular frame gives her true credibility as a female fighter. This is Hilary Swank's film and, while flexing muscles and breaking jaws, her acting of the more personal intimate scenes is deeply touching and is the best I've seen in a long time. She gives a five-star performance and steals the show.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>If you like Clint's earlier films such as Mystic River or Unforgiven, this film is a definite must-see. Also if you are a fan of boxing movies such as the legendary 'Raging Bull' or classic 'Rocky' you'll love this movie.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	128	2011-03-26
129	1	15	\N	Lemony Snickets A Series of Unfortunate Events	<p>A fantasy film that is based on a highly successful series of children's novels that centres on a trio of resourceful kids. Sound familiar? Well, Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is actually very different from its spec-wearing, wand waving rival franchise Harry Potter.</p> \r\n<p>When an unexplained fire devastates the Baudelaire house and kills the parents of Violet, Klaus and Sunny, the three orphans are sent to live with their distant relative Count Olaf, a man who has designs on their late parents' vast fortune.</p> \r\n<p>Based on the first three books of what will eventually be a thirteen novel series, Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events fails to adapt its source material into a satisfying film experience. Despite having never read any of the books I could quite easily pinpoint where each of the three books start and end within the film's running time.</p> \r\n<p>Younger children may be frightened by the dark subject matter that regularly presents its young heroes with potential salvation only to brutally slam the door on their chances of a happy ending. Alternatively adults will tire quickly of a straightforward plot that develops its back story at a snails pace and more infuriatingly, quickly begins to repeat itself.</p> \r\n<p>Emily Browning and Liam Aiken as the two older children, Violet and Klaus, give decent performances although at times they look a little bored of constantly being on the receiving end of Jim Carrey's overacting. Carrey is, for the most part, entertaining in the role of the deceitful, self obsessed actor Count Olaf and it is unsurprising that, during the middle of the film, when the children escape the guardianship of the Count and Carrey is off screen, that the picture really begins to stagnate.</p>\r\n<p>A first rate supporting cast made up of Timothy Spall, Meryl Streep and Billy Connolly all crop up although, to varying degrees, are given little to do. Jude Law, who appears in at least one film release a week at the moment, provides the voice of Lemony Snicket, the narrator to the children's troubles.</p> \r\n<p>The film is still far from being a disaster. The ingenious methods the children use to escape from the plots of the sinister Olaf are among the film's highlights, particularly when the kids are trapped in the path of a speeding express train, and it is impossible to deny the flawless style of the sets, costumes and props but sadly at no point did I feel immersed in the world of Lemony Snicket.</p> \r\n<p>Films such as The Incredibles and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban have proved over the past year that the best children's films can be entertaining for kids of any age but unfortunately Lemony Snicket was lacking in the required magic.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	129	2011-03-26
130	1	20	\N	Napoleon Dynamite	<p>Napoleon Dynamite, the hero of the title, is a lonely teenage warrior fighting a seemingly solitary battle against the forces that appear to be ruining his life including his vain and ambitious uncle, his peers at school and even his family's pet llama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At some time we all feel like the outsider who is being bullied by public perception. Isolated, we lash out at our detractors and yet yearn for some kind of acceptance. You grow up and you get through it but you don't forget the pain of those teenage years. Napoleon Dynamite taps into those memories of teenage blues to make a touching and humorous classic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although he is a bit inept at sports and mixing with his peers Napoleon's defiant and persistent drive makes him an endearing character and as we watch him stumble through social embarrassment we feel empathy and ultimately want him to succeed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Films such as American Pie, She's All That and Road Trip all include the clich nerdy teens who in actual fact are just a little badly dressed and in need of grooming, a fact that 'Not Another Teen Movie' lampooned to great effect. These plastic teens often come from wealthy families and their only real angst is that they have trouble getting laid. As a contrast, Napoleon comes from a dysfunctional background in a small rural town. His lack of taste in clothing is the least of his troubles with his less than classic facial features, excessive height and some serious personality issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite an odd appearance and a lack of tact or grace, Napoleon is likeable. Early on in the film he befriends the quiet new kid Pedro, a Mexican with a cool bike. With one friend and an army of enemies, we follow Napoleon as he is beset by various social challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At home Napoleon clashes with his vain uncle Rico who is obsessed with getting back to 1982, and his curious relative Kip who has a heavy online relationship with a mysterious lady in Detroit. Meanwhile Pedro has an election battle on his hands after he decides to run for class president. School jocks with trendy clothes and more testicles than brain cells predictably think with their cocks and so Pedro has some fierce competition in the form of perfectly pert cheerleader babe Summer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along the way Napoleon and Pedro will jump ramps, care for chickens, attempt time travel, and befriend lonely artist Deb. They may even find some romance, after all both lads need a date to the school dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jared and Jerusha Hess have written a lovely simple script and Jared, as director, has made a lovely film. The cast is free from big names so there is no ego massaging and the new acting and comedy talent are refreshing. Particular mention must be made for the three primary leads Tina Majorino as artistic but slightly quirky Deb, Efren Ramirez as silent and ambitious Pedro and especially Jon Heder as Napoleon Dynamite himself. Newcomer Heder in the lead role combines clumsy lumbering body comedy with aggressive vocals to make an intense character realistic yet absurd, a great breakout role.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hilarious and embarrassing adventures of Napoleon and Pedro are great entertainment and the sharp script and great comedy talent of the cast make this a sure fire cult movie that will hopefully gain even more success on DVD.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	130	2011-03-26
132	1	12	\N	2046	<p>In 1960s Hong Kong, Chow Mo Wan (Tony Leung Kar Wai - Hero) copes with the pain of a lost love by drinking and gambling his nights away, fuelling his vices by selling lurid romance tales to newspapers and borrowing from his friends. He becomes a ladies man and engages in a string of casual relationships, walking away as soon as they threaten to become more serious. In spite of his behaviour and his obsession with the past, he finds himself dwelling upon the women that he encounters, such as the exotic dancer Lulu (Carina Lau), temperamental Bai Li (Zhang Ziyi - <i>House of Flying Daggers</i>), obsessed Wang Jin Wen (Faye Wong - <i>Chungking Express</i>), and the gambler Su Li Zhen (Gong Li - <i>Farewell My Concubine</i>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you've seen a Wong Kar Wai film before, you'll be well prepared for the languid pacing, hypnotic visuals, thin plot and self-referential indulgence. If not, then this might not be the best film to start with, more so given that it is a follow up to Wong's previous film <i>In The Mood For Love</i>. Verging on the abstract at times, with little in the way of a coherent narrative, <i>2046</i> isn't a smooth ride, but the array of gorgeous visuals never fails to amaze even when the plot is moving along at a crawl. Wong has always been a master of evoking mood\r\nand emotion through images and sound, and this is where he excels with <i>2046</i>, propped up by superb performances from his two leads. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tony Leung is a world class actor and unsurprisingly his acting here is as outstanding as it was in <i>Hero</i> and <i>Infernal Affairs</i>. His character's facile suaveness is superbly effected with an undercurrent of pain and loss, occasionally revealing the bitter hopelessness in which he has trapped himself. On the other hand, Zhang Ziyi's performance is somewhat of a shock, showing a range beyond her usual alternation between petulant rage and innocent beauty. This is all the more impressive given that Wong prefers to make his cast improvise\r\nrather than write them a proper script, so with any luck she will continue to be given opportunities to demonstrate her ability. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps Zhang Ziyi was so entrancing in fact, that the director forgot about the other women in the film. This is the impression that one gets from the division of screen time between the leading ladies. Zhang Ziyi gets the lion's share, closely followed by Faye Wong. Carina Lau hardly gets a look in, and Gong Li's sequence is rushed through at the start and the end of the film, leaving her little else other than to look good, which luckily is something she can do without trying too hard but doesn't really do her acting skills any justice. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>2046</i> was initially envisaged as a pure SF film, but Wong became so involved in the filming of <i>In The Mood For Love</i> that he decided to make another film set in the same period, and relegated the science fiction story to a sub-thread. As a result the SF element is almost visibly bolted on to the rest of the film, and in some way this detracts from its representation of the film's underlying theme; a place where lost memories can be regained and changed, and the pain that accompanies it can be rejected. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea that love is all about timing, that there is a moment in every relationship where things come together or fall apart depending on what one does next, is something that has appeared in more than a few of Wong's films, <i>In The Mood For Love</i> being the prime example. Having suffered the pain of his missed chance in the past, Chow is determined to never run that risk again, and is content to dwell in self-imposed purgatory without trying to find that same level of intimacy again. He seems to deliberately sabotage his relationships so\r\nthat the key moment never comes to pass, and this continuous circle of self-destruction makes for frustrating and painful viewing. It is almost impossible to feel any sympathy for his plight unless one has seen <i>In The Mood For Love</i> prior to <i>2046</i>. It is the Wong\r\nKar Wai film that is the most heavily referenced, and without it it is difficult to maintain interest in a long, slow film whose main character is an utter bastard. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>2046</i> has been five years in the making, and at times it feels as if Wong has managed to convey this sense of time to the viewing experience. It feels far longer than its two hour running time, and would have worked just as well, if not better, had it been trimmed by a good half hour or so, but it is still a wonderful and beautiful film that should bring Wong Kar Wai to an even bigger audience.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	132	2011-03-26
134	1	20	\N	Assault on Precinct 13	<p>A washed up cop and a few colleagues are preparing for a quiet new years eve at sleepy Precinct 13 before the station is officially closed. Their plans for a relaxing evening are soon dashed when they receive some unexpected guests.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>A bus full of convicts including one of Detroit's big time gangsters, recently arrested, needs shelter from a blizzard and as Precinct 13 is on the way, they decide to move in. The few cops on the bus and in the station soon transfer all the crooks into the cells and try once again to get a quiet night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It doesn't take long for the action to pick up. Two masked gunmen silently enter the police station from the back and are about to strike when a cop stumbles upon them and raises the alarm. As the cops lock down the station it soon becomes clear that they are under siege from all sides by an unknown number of attackers. With the phone lines cut, mobile phones and radio frequencies jammed, the cops are well and truly cornered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A remake of John Carpenter's 1976 cult classic, Assault on Precinct 13 tries to refresh the format and add a few new elements to the story to try and bring the film into focus. However it is hard to bring anything into focus when most of the action is filmed using hand held cameras. Despite efforts to spruce up the classic, this film stumbled from clich to clich with inevitable results. Whereas Carpenter's film was gritty, if low budget, this film cannot use those excuses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ethan Hawke (Training Day) as a mentally scarred cop Jake Roenick, trying to rally his troops and withstand the siege, does well despite some poor dialogue. As the lead role, Jack benefits from some back story but the "once great cop gnawed by guilt who turns to drink" character has been used so many times its difficult to offer anything new. Similarly Lawrence Fishburne (Matrix Revolutions) as the confident, cold and reserved super villain emanates a good amount of latent menace. Unfortunately even if the two leads do manage to act well, with such a well trodden plot structure there can be few surprises and it's apparent from very early on where this film is gonna go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The remaining cast are given too little material to have any real impact despite some effort to add personality. Outside the police station the leader of the attackers is none other than acting master Gabriel Byrne (Vanity Fair), but with so little dialogue he is a little lost in the snow. Meanwhile helping to fight the good fight, John Leguizamo (Summer of Sam) as a drug addled crook named Beck adds some humour during his fast talking paranoid rants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I arrived at the cinema hoping to see a good action film with gun fights and tension, that's all I received, no more. So how do I rate this film? If you go to see this film knowing what's going to happen and expecting no more, it's good fun. If you go with any lingering hopes of an improvement on the original then you may be a little disappointed. Overall Assault on Precinct 13 has lots of good ingredients but sadly tastes a little bland.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>If you liked 'S.W.A.T' or 'The Recruit' you should find this an entertaining movie.</p>	2	2011-03-26	134	2011-03-26
136	1	16	\N	Hitch	<p>After a few years of fighting killer robots, Cuban drug lords and even swimming with sharks, Will Smith (Shark Tale) returns to his comedic roots in a great new romantic comedy. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith plays Alex Hitchens, a godsend to desperate men looking for love. Branded as the 'date-doctor', Hitch acts as a 'cure for the common man'. His aim is to see decent and almost invisible men win the hearts of some of the most unobtainable women in New York.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hitch's natural charm works wonders with women and his methods of seduction are a sure fire hit. Well, at least for everyone else's love life. Hitch soon finds out that his cocky self assured philosophy doesn't seem to work so well in his own personal life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Hitch meets beautiful gossip columnist Sara (Eva Mendes - Stuck on you), he has a tough job on his hands to melt through her icy man-hating exterior. But once he has overcome that hurdle, things just seem to go from bad to worse as the couple encounter mishap after embarrassing mishap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a dedicated news hound, Sara never lets an exclusive story pass her by and when she discovers Hitch's true profession she is determined to bag the scoop regardless of the consequences. As the dating consultant and the gossip queen are set to collide, the stage is set for a classic romantic crisis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right now Will Smith can do no wrong and every film he features in is sure to be a huge box office success. Hitch is no different and gives Smith the chance to relive his Fresh Prince days and show us all what he does best, comedy.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Mention must also be given to Smith's most ambitious client to date, Kevin James (The King of Queens) as Albert, a chubby modest accountant with eyes for a wealthy and stunning celebrity way above his social ranking. Don't miss an array of unforgettable dance moves from this guy. Not forgetting Eva Mendes as the beautiful, if cynical, love interest to complement Smith's smooth talking and charming attributes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hitch has everything you would expect from a romantic comedy, although I must admit I was expecting a little more comedy from Smith's character. I forgive him though, Smith never disappoints and I will always be a huge fan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This film is great for the family, couples and especially teenagers who will probably appreciate the fantastic soundtrack (including my Usher fave, 'Yeah!'). If you liked 'How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days' or 'Shallow Hal' you will love this movie.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	136	2011-03-26

TJ has found a new location for pimping in the heart of Amsterdam and he is determined to get Deuce back in the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deuce is reluctant to go back to his gigolo days and TJ has conveniently forgotten to mention that there is a serial killer on the loose bumping off the best man-whores in Europe. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As bad luck would have it, Deuce ends up inadvertently getting TJ implicated as the murderer and, even worse, the whole country thinks TJ is gay!

Like his adventures in the first film, Deuce has to date his fair share of freaky and frankly scary women to try and clear TJ's name and to uncover the real killer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During his mission, Deuce meets sweet and innocent European babe Eva (Hanna Verboom - Snowfever) who attracts Deuce with her beauty and very noticeable obsessive compulsive disorder.  Will Eva too fall under the suspect category?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schneider is competent as nave Deuce Bigalow but fails to shine as he did in the first movie.  His performance in this film was mostly hindered by the bad storyline, ridiculous characters and repetitive script. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo was a huge disappointment.  It failed to spark hardly any laughs due to its lack of originality.  There are only so many times that the words "he-bitch" and "man-whore" can trigger a laugh, especially after being used to death in the first movie.  This film is full of ridiculous and simply disgusting new characters and it was basically a poor rehash of the original hit comedy.  It's clear that director Mike Bigelow has chosen a turkey of a movie as his directional big screen debut.  He should never have bothered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not that I need to tell you but please avoid this movie at all costs.  I loved the original movie but the sequel is a poor comparison and not worth wasting your money on.  If you want to watch a proper comedy and one that will make you laugh your socks off then go see <i>The 40 Year Old Virgin</i>.</p>\r\n	1	2011-03-26	139	2012-03-08
80	1	20	Blah	The Forgotten	<p>Telly Paretta (Julianne Moore - Laws of Attraction) is a woman haunted by the memories of her lost son Sam, a victim of a mysterious plane crash. Each day she watches home videos and looks through albums of photographs to remind her of the son she misses. Her husband Jim (Anthony Edwards - Thunderbirds) is trying to get on with his life and hopes that his wife will let go of the past. However things are about to turn a little strange. One day the videos and pictures of Sam disappear and when Telly confronts her husband he tells her shockingly that they never had a son. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a state of panic Telly flees the family home to try and find a record of her son and as she digs the mystery deepens. She can find no record of her son, of the plane crash or anyone with any recollection of her child, except one. Ash Correll (Dominic West - Mona Lisa Smile) was the father of one of Sam's friend's, a young girl named Lauren who was also lost in the crash. At first Ash has no memory of his daughter but when evidence is thrust before his eyes, both Ash and Telly face a more frightening mystery. How can two people who do not each other remember children that never existed? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This cycle of investigation and mystery continues throughout the entire movie but sadly the pace is slow and the revelations are slow to arrive. Also the story is curiously reminiscent, albeit more pedestrian, to that of Alex Proyas' 1998 cult classic Dark City. The lack of depth of the story combined with the slow pace add up to an adequate thriller with a few twists here and there. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Julianne Moore is as impressive as ever as the undaunted and adamant mother, Telly, seeking answers to some very big questions. Meanwhile Dominic West gets more screen time than in recent movies that allows him to show off some fine acting skills. In support Gary Sinise (The Big Bounce) puts in a token effort as Telly's confused shrink and Alfre Woodward (The Core) adds some of the only elements of humour as the gritty streetwise detective who gets tangled up in the mystery. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Director Joseph Ruben (Sleeping with the Enemy) has shown in the past his ability to build up strong characters and he does this again in The Forgotten. Sadly he doesn't give the character much to do other than run around and look baffled or angry. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>All in all this was an adequate thriller with some surprising moments but the brooding menace and suspense hinted at in the trailer is lost and diluted in two hours of running and hiding from god knows what. In a movie month filled with snow and sleigh bells this is a pleasant if weak distraction from family films and should appeal to anyone who enjoys X-Files type conspiracy stories or the recent Manchurian Candidate.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	80	2012-03-08
138	1	16	Blah	Kinsey	<p>In the late 1940s, Professor Alfred Kinsey (Liam Neeson - Love Actually) sparked outrage with his frank and candid views on sex in his book, Sexual Behaviour in the Human Male.</p>\r\n\r\nFormerly a zoologist studying gall wasps, Kinsey is hired as a biology teacher at Indiana University. Prok (as he was affectionately known by his students) starts courting student Clara McMillen (Laura Linney - Love Actually) who he ends up marrying.</p>\r\n\r\nSoon after Kinsey and Mac have married, their first sexual encounter turns out to be a complete disaster and it is this that prompts Kinsey to follow a new line of research.</p>\r\n\r\nMany of his students are in the dark about sexual and marital matters. But at a time when sex was such a taboo subject, the closest the students ever got to learning about sex was through an inadequate hygiene lesson taught by Kinsey's rival, Thurman (Tim Curry - Bailey's Billion$), a man who portrays sex as pure evil.</p>\r\n\r\nTo counteract the damage Thurman's lesson is having on young couples, Kinsey starts his own sexual relations and marriage course and in no time at all he is branded the "sex doctor".</p>\r\n\r\nIn a bid to tackle this sensitive subject, Kinsey rounds up a group of slightly dysfunctional researchers to help him conduct his controversial study on sexual behaviour. His first book on male sexual habits is a sensation however his findings cause some frowns. His quest to complete his book on women is not without obstruction and soon Kinsey is struggling to keep his research study afloat as the public and funding bodies slowly turn against him.</p>\r\n\r\nNeeson performs well in a role that pushes the boundaries of convention although there were some instances of overacting in the more emotional scenes.  Neeson's lead role was somewhat overshadowed at times by Linney's harrowing performance. Linney as the loyal wife had a smaller role yet stood out from the rest in a convincing, touching and emotional performance.</p>\r\n\r\nOther notable performances came from the eager and obedient student Clyde (Peter Sarsgaard - Garden State), who did well to contend with a multi-faceted character. John Lithgow (The Life and Death of Peter Sellers) provides some humour as Kinsey's tyrannical father while Chris O'Donnell (29 Palms) returns to the big screen after two years away from standing in front of a camera. Also popping up from relative obscurity Timothy Hutton (Secret Window) has a small but creditable role as an adulterous researcher.</p>\r\n\r\nThis biopic tackles a delicate subject head on by punching through social boundaries. Writer and director Bill Condon (Candyman) has not shied away from a difficult subject and has no qualms about using the "shock" factor in a couple of honest and realistic scenes, albeit slightly disturbing and graphic at times for some viewers.</p>\r\n\r\nKinsey is purely an adult film dealing with adult issues. Unless you are prepared to watch it with an open mind, you may be left feeling a little uneasy or uncomfortable. A truly eye opening film on a sensitive but everyday issue that should be easy to discuss yet, even now after fifty years, the subject remains taboo.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	138	2012-03-08

141	1	20	\N	Sahara	<p>A beautiful woman walks into a lighthouse on a lonely stretch of abandoned beach and examines a disgusting corpse. As she leaves she is chased and attacked by cloaked figures. They wrestle her down to the ground but luckily she is rescued by a muscled and tanned American who fights off the three attackers single-handedly wearing only his swim shorts. All the while the sun beats down upon the scene and the lady watches her saviour with thankful eyes. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>That scene has everything you need for an action no-brain pop corn flick; a beautiful woman, a hunky man, a chase (albeit on foot), a fight (albeit with no guns), good scenery, a mysterious corpse and a hint of sexual energy. This is one of the early scenes in the new action adventure 'Sahara'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ambitious adventurer Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey - How To Lose a Guy in 10 Days) and his faithful sidekick Al (Steve Zahn - Shattered Glass) are treasure hunters working for confident ex-admiral Sandecker (William H Macy - Cellular), searching for sunken treasures. For some time now Dirk has been seeking, in vain, a mythical iron clad vessel that left civil war America loaded with gold and now off the coast Nigeria. He thinks he has found a fresh clue that places the ship somewhere near Mali.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile sexy but outspoken Dr Eva (Penelope Cruz - Gothika) is investigating a spate of recent deaths due to a strange illness (hence corpse in a lighthouse scene). As Dr Eva collates her data wouldn't you know it, the disease seems to be spreading from a central point somewhere in Mali.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It doesn't take too long for the sexy doctor and the hunky archaeologist to team up and take a trip up the Niger river into war ridden Mali. Cue lots of adventures, car chases, sand, camels, boats, dodgy Frenchmen, sand, tanks, Bedouin rebels, conspiracies, sand etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a no-brain action adventure. With a lot of great action pieces, even if it lacks originality, this film has energy and all the necessary ingredients for a popcorn hit. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>McConaughey is suitably buff and bronze (in fact he looks distinctly orange in certain scenes) as the daredevil hero while Penelope Cruz looks great even if she struggles with her few shreds of dialogue. In support Steve Zahn exceeds his responsibility as comedy sidekick to be a credible hero in his own right while William H Macy provides political support as the aged mentor fighting a paper war in the back ground. The baddies are suitably menacing in a clich kind of way but where would the film be without a slippery French industrialist and a military dictator?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comparable newcomer Breck Eisner has directed a great action movie that brings a bit of energy to the cinema after a fairly tepid spring. In fact it is possible that the buddy relationship that we see between McConaughey and Zahn bode well for a credible sequel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Go watch and enjoy, the story is crap but the film is entertaining nonetheless.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	141	2011-03-26
142	1	20	\N	Robots	<p>Try to imagine a world inhabited exclusively by robots of all different shapes and sizes with different jobs and personalities. This is the world of the new animated movie Robots from the same creative team that produced Ice Age. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of recreating our world with fish replacing people or populating European mythology with modern day references, the world of Robots feels more original and refreshing and the story, although simple, is great fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A young and ambitious robot named Rodney (Ewan McGregor - Star Wars) has aspirations to become an inventor and help improve the lives of robots everywhere. In pursuit of his dreams Rodney travels to the big city to meet with Bigweld (Mel Brooks - Dracula, Dead and Lovin' It), an industrial mogul and Rodney's source of inspiration.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Sadly Rodney arrives only to find Bigweld mysteriously absent and his company in the control of a vain wannabe dictator, Ratchet (Greg Kinnear - Godsend) with a dastardly plan to create a new world order. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If this all sounds a little heavy don't worry, it's a fun film for all the family. Idealistic Rodney, feeling rejected falls in (literally) with a gang of rusty robots who help him to find his feet. Leader of the gang is Fender (Robin Williams - Insomnia) who along with his eccentric crew will lead Rodney through the streets and help him fulfil his dreams. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along the way there are some great scenes and set pieces as well as an array of fun characters including walking lampposts, a bizarre public transport system and some scary road sweepers. Rodney will investigate the disappearance of Bigweld while repairing neglected robots along the way, becoming a local hero and leading him to a confrontation with Ratchet.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>After a year crammed with animation blockbusters such as Shark Tale, Shrek 2 and The Incredibles, any studio would need to be fairly brave to invest the enormous amount of time and effort an animated feature must require. Luckily the gamble has paid off and Robots is a great movie that surpasses expectations to create a funny and original kid's film.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The voices of Ewan McGregor and Robin Williams make a great comedy duo for the lead roles. After the best part of a decade away from animation the zany wit of Robin Williams steals the show as Rodney's new found friend Fender. Also adding to the comedy, Mel Brooks makes his first major move into animation as the voice of Bigweld. </p>\r\n\r\n<p> I could write quotes from the script or describe some of the action but why bother? Get in touch with your inner child and go see the film. Robots is great for young families, anyone who enjoyed Robin Williams as the Genie in Aladdin, fans of the Shrek movies and anyone prepared to sit in a kids movie.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	142	2011-03-26
143	1	16	\N	Miss Congeniality 2	<p>If you were a follower of Gracie Hart's (Sandra Bullock - Two Weeks Notice) unorthodox and clumsy crime tackling behaviour, then prepare yourself for the second instalment of her adventures as an FBI agent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three weeks after emerging as the FBI's heroine for solving the beauty pageant sabotage attempt, Gracie has become a huge celebrity.  But her new found popularity is leading her into sticky situations and putting her colleagues' lives in jeopardy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her chief McDonald (Ernie Hudson - Miss Congeniality) decides she would be safer out of the field and on television as the new face of the FBI.</p>  \r\n\r\n<p>After ten months of fame Gracie has become soft and pampered but then one day she is sent to Las Vegas to cover the publicity side of a recent kidnap case.  Lo and behold, she soon discovers that the victims are none other than her pageant friends Cheryl (Heather Burns - Two Weeks Notice) and Stan Fields (William Shatner - Dodgeball).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Desperate to ditch her publicity duties and media interviews, Gracie tries to slip away from the limelight and solve the case herself.  Not far behind her is new FBI recruit Sam Fuller (Regina King - Ray) who has a serious aggression problem and who has been ordered to act as Gracie's bodyguard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Gracie and Sam's relationship begins on a rocky footing, the pair must learn the meaning of partnership if they are to solve the crime and save the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bullock is on top form in this sequel and delivers some great one-liners in her own individual style.  Don't miss the return of some great in-jokes from the original film.  King's supporting performance is truly memorable and the two bounce off one another to create some hilarious brawling scenes.  Other notable performances come from Diedrich Bader (Eurotrip) as crazy fashion stylist Joel in a similar role to that of Michael Caine in the first film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Miss Congeniality 2 is an entertaining sequel packed full of all the comedy and style of its predecessor.  If you enjoyed the original film and other cop comedy capers like Charlie's Angels and the Rush Hour films, then you are sure to like this movie.  Remember to stay for the outtakes in the end credits.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	143	2011-03-26
145	1	15	\N	The Jacket	<p>The excellent Adrien Brody heads a uniformly excellent ensemble cast in director John Maybury's weird time-travel thriller, The Jacket, which sadly ends up to be rather a waste of time. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>Gulf War veteran Jack Starks (Brody - The Village) is hitchhiking across a snow encrusted American landscape in late 1992 when he accepts a lift from a stranger who promptly murders a highway patrol officer and takes off. Jack is left bleeding and unconscious at the side of the road next to the cop's dead body and finds himself convicted and sent to a hospital for the criminally insane. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>So far, so straightforward, but before Jack can even settle down in his asylum Kris Kristofferson (Blade) turns up as his doctor, has him pumped full of drugs, strapped into a strait jacket and locked in a morgue draw, all in the name of medical science. Odd, but not as odd as what happens to poor wrongly convicted Jack when he actually wakes up inside the metal coffin. Before you can say 'random shift in plot' he finds himself a free and wandering man in 2007 who just happens to bump into a now fully grown little girl he met just before his arrest in 1992 (Keira Knightley -King Arthur). </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Daniel Craig (Layer Cake) pops up as a fellow inmate in what will hopefully be his final film playing a bit part supporting role.  Knightley is finally given material that proves she can act, although her American accent, seemingly achieved by talking out of only one side of her mouth, is a little disconcerting at first. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>After a promising set up, the film then spends the second half of its running time jumping between the two time frames trying to discover why Jack dies in the grounds of the hospital in 1993 and, perhaps more importantly, why does Keira's character drink and smoke so much? </p>\r\n \r\n<p>After seeing that classic weird time travel filmmaking in Donnie Darko, I was left with the extraordinary feeling that the very odd film I had just watched didn't make a lick of sense but, by god, I was going to keep watching it until it did. The Jacket, however, has no complicated hidden truths locked within its twisting narrative. It's a film which, while never ponderous, uses every trick in the book to distract you from the fact that they have no explanation for the central premise. No hints, no clues. No idea.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	145	2011-03-26
146	1	15	\N	Hostage	<p>Any suggestion that Hostage is Bruce Willis returning to his Die Hard roots is well wide of the mark. Yes, before the end of the film Bruce is starting to look a little worse for wear and a dozen or so villains have been blasted to smithereens, but at no point does Willis lose his shoes or find reason to run around in a blood drenched vest. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Willis deserves credit for producing a performance that at no point evokes memories of wisecracking John McClane. Jeff Talley is a very different animal. Apparently a laid back dude with silly facial hair during his heyday as a hostage negotiator, Talley is now a clean shaven serious policeman who avoids pressure situations in a back water town. Yes, that's right, poor old Jeff has a tragic mistake to his name that has left him a shadow of his former self . While working as the top negotiator in Los Angeles Talley failed to talk down a fundamentalist Christian psychopath holding two people hostage. He could do nothing to prevent the man from brutally executing a woman and her young son. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his new picturesque small town surroundings Jeff only has to worry about his strained relationship with his wife and daughter and presumably whether or not the nice old policewoman who answers the phones at the sheriff station still has a pulse. However before you can say 'here comes trouble over the hill,' the home of dodgy accountant Walter Smith (Kevin Pollack - End of Days) is introduced with all the musical subtlety of a bond villain's lair and we meet the three grubby looking Goths who decide to rob it. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon poor Walter has a nasty bump on his head and Talley's only able looking deputy is lying in a pool of blood on the driveway of Walter's home. Perhaps the skills of an experienced but emotionally scarred hostage negotiator might be needed to save Walter's two children from the hands of the trigger happy trio of villains? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Talley isn't enthusiastic and hands control of the situation to his colleagues but a second group of villains aren't willing to let him off so easily. Walter is a mob accountant and he has information in his fortress-like house about where their cash is stashed and these more organised, but less interesting baddies want it. To help them recover the data, Talley's own family are kidnapped so they can force the police chief to do exactly what they tell him. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Hostage, Willis is given the opportunity to prove his acting range more than his past roles have usually allowed him. He screams, he shouts, cuts corners and gets all emotional but sadly all this bluster fails to impact on the audience because it's hard to believe his family are in any actual danger. While Walter Smith, his family and their captors are well established, Talley's wife and daughter are barely introduced while the masked gunmen holding them are barely given enough screen time to pose as a credible threat. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the main plot taking place at Walter's house is tense and involving, the second kidnapping feels contrived and is often silly and distracting. The plans of the mob gunmen never really make sense and their presence only seems to have been included to give Talley an extra hoop to jump through while getting the job done. What could have been an exciting action thriller is in the end dragged down by the implausibility of a B-plot that tumbles on to its inevitable conclusion ten minutes after the dramatic resolution to the events at Walter's house. It is the characters and situation here that the audience has invested in but instead the film makers decide not to play on these strengths to the overall detriment of the film.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	146	2011-03-26
148	1	16	\N	Harold & Kumar Get The Munchies	<p>Fresh and fun Asian comedy duo John Cho (Solaris) and Kal Penn (Van Wilder Party Liaison), hit our screens in the new screwball adventure Harold & Kumar Get The Munchies. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harold (Cho) works as a number cruncher at an investment bank while friend and flatmate Kumar is rebelling against his father's demands that he pursue a career in medicine. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with most teen movies these days, the lead characters can't survive long without the calming and relaxing effects of some herbal remedies. While Harold and Kumar get stoned after a stressful day of work and interviews, they start to get the munchies. Their plan is simple, get to the White Castle burger bar as quickly as possible and by any means possible. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>On their own mini road trip, Harold and Kumar come across an unbelievable number of obstacles blocking their path to gastronomic satisfaction. Who would have thought getting to a burger bar forty minutes away would be such a chore? Luckily when Harold and Kumar get the munchies, nothing can get between them and the food they crave. Not even a bunch of kayaking bullies, a deformed gospel-singing repair man, his fit wife, a racist police department or even Doogie Howser M.D himself. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cho and Penn make a great team as troublesome twosome Harold & Kumar. Unlike other teen comedies it is refreshing to see two Asian actors breaking into the big blockbuster scene and grabbing lead roles. From relative obscurity in cameo roles from American Pie and Van Wilder, these two guys have burst onto the scene with flair. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I must admit this film surpassed my expectations of what I had expected to be a mediocre comedy. This pairing in pure genius and by far surpasses their lame by comparison predecessors, Ashton Kutcher and Sean William Scott in <i>'Dude, Where's My Car'</i>. This film is aimed at a teen audience and fans of the American Pie movies and Road Trip. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a fun comedy adventure and has moments of greatness enough to green light a sequel. Something tells me the next film may be called 'Harold & Kumar go to Amsterdam'.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	148	2011-03-26
151	1	20	\N	The Hitchikers Guide To The Galaxy	<p>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy follows the adventures of Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman - Love Actually) after he is saved from planet Earth's destruction by his close friend Ford Prefect (Mos Def - Love Actually). It soon transpires that Ford is not from Guildford after all but is actually an alien and a writer for the said "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy". </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stowing away on one of the many Vogon destructor ships that annihilated the Earth, Arthur and Ford begin an adventure that will shape the future of humanity and answer the greatest question of all time, even if the question itself may be elusive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along the way Arthur and Ford bump into Ford's distant cousin and president of the universe, Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell - Matchstick Men) and more surprisingly another human, Trillian (Zooey Deschanel - Elf). Arthur had met Trillian months before at a party and had fallen madly in love only to watch as the egomaniac, Zaphod, stole her away with promises of adventure. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a madcap voyage to locate the lost planet of Magrathia and its many mysteries, Arthur, Ford, Zaphod and Trillian will encounter all manner of aliens, improbabilities, planet designers, mental mice and learn some shocking truths about the universe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a script penned by Douglas Adams, the creator of the original Radio Play, Books and Television series, The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy manages to cram in many of the most memorable concepts and sequences from those previous adventures to make one great film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brimming with British talent and some great dialogue, this movie is eccentric and fun filled with great effects and an 'anything's possible' surrealism that is refreshing in a big budget movie. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Martin Freeman and Mos Def work well together and convincingly project the banter between true friends despite the often absurd situations they find themselves in. Similarly Sam Rockwell's energetic performance as the egocentric president Zaphod is great fun while Zooey Deschanel is smart and sexy as Trillian, more prepared for adventure than Arthur but seemingly more surprised at what she finds. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In support Alan Rickman (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) provides the moody voice of cult icon Marvin the Paranoid Android while the clear and intelligent tones of Stephen Fry (The Life and Death of Peter Sellers) act as the narrator telling us useful tidbits of information from the titular guide book itself.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>"According to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the best drink in the known universe is the Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster. It has the effect of having your brains smashed out with a slice of lemon... wrapped around a large gold brick." <i>The Book</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition John Malkovitch, Bill Nighy, Helen Mirren, Bill Bailey and Richard Griffiths all pop up from time to time. Loyal fans with a sharp eye may even spot references to the original TV show including a cameo from the original Arthur and Marvin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering the demanding storyline, the difficulty in marketing satire and the eternal problem of remaking a cult classic, director Garth Jennings has done a good job. For those who have never seen, heard or read the original material, this movie is a great introduction. The acting is great, the timing of the jokes is good and the effects are brilliant. If you are a fan of Red Dwarf or Dark Star you should take the time to check this movie out. Anyone who doesn't leave singing 'Thanks for all the fish' is a rotten egg.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	151	2011-03-26
152	1	16	\N	XXX 2	<p>Rapper Ice Cube (Are we there yet?) fills the empty shoes of his predecessor Vin Diesel to become the new XXX agent, hired to save the world from the megalomaniacs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film opens with the unexpected security breach of the hidden NSA lair of Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L Jackson - Coach Carter). After a narrow escape, the last XXX having been killed in Bora Bora and the reason for the attack remaining a mystery, Gibbons must go 'off the grid' until he can find the answers. To help get those answers, Gibbons approaches former marine and ex con, Darius (Ice Cube).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks to his more than colourful background in military operations and street crime, Darius has plenty of associates who can supply muscle, ammunition and the set of wheels they need. A visit to one of Darius' ex-girlfriends, plus the addition of 'college boy' Toby, help to complete Gibbon's new crime fighting team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with most secret agent action movies you can expect plenty of twists, betrayal, cover-ups and the token pretty blonde as well as the sinister evil villain. However do not count on any realism, plot or originality. The money for these luxuries was probably spent getting Samuel L Jackson and William Dafoe to join the cast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ice Cube is suitably cast as the tough action hero and rises to the challenge delivering some convincing fight scenes and excellent action sequences such as the speed boat leap onto a police car reminiscent of 007 in Live and Let Die. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Credit must also go to William Dafoe (Spiderman 2) as the conniving General Deckert who effortlessly filled the shoes of yet another one dimensional "baddie". Not much can be said for Jackson's performance as his character did not get as much screen time but as usual, Jackson's notoriety seems to give the film some miniscule degree of credibility. Finally we should mention the cameo from 'Pimp My Ride' host Xzibit as a car shop gangster adding muscle to help XXX save the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watch this film if you enjoy mindless (and this certainly is mindless) action, over the top special effects and daring stunts. Give it a miss if you are looking for a storyline, fine acting or inspired original action sequences. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This film is a no-brainer rehash of every secret agent movie less the sophistication that makes those films endearing. Then again if want to switch off the grey matter or if you enjoyed similar no-brainers such as the original XXX, Too Fast Too Furious or the Under Siege franchise, this movie may entertain you.</p>\r\n	1	2011-03-26	152	2011-03-26
154	1	12	\N	Unleashed	<p>Danny (Jet Li - Hero) has been raised to be a human dog, a mindless creature whose sole purpose in life is to protect his captor, Bart (Bob Hoskins - Son of the Mask), with his awesome martial arts skills. Bart is a petty gangster who preys on small businesses for protection money, turning Danny upon any who are stupid enough to resist. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>When a disgruntled victim has Bart gunned down in revenge, Danny escapes and is taken in by Sam (Morgan Freeman - Batman Begins), a blind piano tuner. Sam and his step-daughter Victoria (Kerry Condon - The Halo Effect) slowly rehabilitate Danny through his fascination with music, and eventually he becomes part of their family. But the very much alive Bart wants Danny back, and so Danny must fight one more time for himself and for those he loves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For all his fame in the world of Hong Kong cinema, Jet Li's attempts to break through in Hollywood have been hampered by a string of ill-judged choices featuring inept co-stars, bad writing and shoddy fight scenes. Unleashed looks set to buck that trend with a distinguished cast, an excellent script courtesy of Luc Besson, and fight choreography by the legendary Yuen Woo Ping. This isn't just Li's best Western-made film so far, it's one of the best kung fu films in years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A plot to hold the action scenes together is usually considered to be a bonus in this genre, so it comes as a pleasant surprise that the story of Danny's transformation from dog to man is genuinely good. Jet Li's acting has always played second-fiddle to his martial arts skills, but here he shows that he can act by making his emotionally stunted character seem believable, in addition to his usual kick-arse fighting. Redemption through the power of music and love is such a clich that using it seems like an open invitation for ridicule, but Li's performance makes it heartfelt and affecting. The explanation for his captivity at the hands of Bart won't tax many people, but when the revelation comes it hits home with a punch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Support comes in the form of Kelly Condon, Bob Hoskins and the ever-wonderful Morgan Freeman. Hoskins hams it up brilliantly as the odious gangster Bart, and even manages to evoke a small degree of sympathy. Freeman, on the other hand, acts by numbers, but he is one of those actors who can make a film better by simply being there and reciting his lines in a monotone. Condon is left with the job of being Danny's love interest and the catalyst for his emotional growth, and though she doesn't have much to work with she does a decent enough job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enough about the story, let's talk about the fighting. In a word: brutal. This isn't the polished wire-fu that has become the norm in Western action films since the advent of <i>The Matrix</i>, nor is it the choppy, hyper-realistic type of fighting of <i>The Bourne Supremacy</i>. Unleashed sits somewhere in between, a display of gritty street-fighting where Jet's Li aggression really does bring to mind an enraged animal. Admittedly there is less action than one might hope for, but what is there is relentless and shockingly violent at times. The audience were audibly gasping in sympathy as Danny beats the living hell out of his victims, mercilessly breaking limbs and pounding heads into the floor. Thankfully the editing is measured, so that the fighting is kinetic and fast-paced, without inducing rampant nausea or a headache. If only the rest of Hollywood could pay attention and move away from the over-edited, eyeball-destroying action that is slowly gaining popularity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Unleashed, Jet Li finally breaks his run of Hollywood turkeys in a film that combines superb action with a good story. Here's hoping that this is only the start of Jet Li's ascendance in the West.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	154	2011-03-26
155	1	20	\N	Star Wars Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith	<p>How do I even begin to try and explain the Star Wars phenomenon? Firstly, who on the planet has not heard of Star Wars or know what the films were about? There can't be many who have escaped the clutches of possibly the biggest cinema franchise of all time. If you have, where have you been hiding? Do you know what you have been missing? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the early 1970's the science fiction genre had recovered from Kubrick's 2001 and was now reserved for an audience of nerds and B-Movies with the occasional movie gem popping up now and then. In 1977 that all changed when the relatively new director George Lucas released Star Wars. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scale of the story and the effects were unlike anything anyone had seen and the movie instantly became a cinematic landmark. Even today Star Wars is considered a masterpiece by the majority of film critics and it paved the way for a big time revival of the science fiction genre. Following Star Wars, there were two sequels each adding a piece to the saga and paving the way for one of the biggest movie franchises in history. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>A long time ago in a galaxy far away an evil empire has near complete control over countless planets and star systems. The mysterious Emperor Palpatine and his chief henchman, the ruthless Lord Darth Vader, have a tight grip over everyone and kill or destroy any who stand in their way. Against this omnipresent superior power a small rebel alliance fights for freedom. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first film in the Star Wars franchise was titled 'Episode IV: A new Hope" and followed the story of two droids that hold the secret to a weapon of mass destruction. Narrowly escaping the grasp of the sinister Lord Vader, the two droids crash land on a desert moon where they are purchased by a simple farmer and his nephew, Luke Skywalker. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Living a dreary life on a desert planet, Luke dreams of becoming a pilot and fighting in the resistance against the Empire. One day while he is cleaning one of the droids he stumbles on a message fragment that will ultimately lead him on a series of adventures into space and a confrontation with the evil Lord Vader. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the saga unfolds, Luke makes new friends and enemies, joins the rebel alliance and learns about his heritage and the once mighty Jedi Knights who used to maintain the peace before the rise of the Empire. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Jedi had incredible powers including the ability to manipulate minds, to perceive all life around them, to literally see without using their eyes and most impressively, to move objects with the power of thought. Orphaned while only a baby Luke learns that his father was once a great Jedi Knight and that he too possesses the ability to use 'The Force'. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout the three movies (Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi) Luke learns how to use the force and to become a Jedi Knight. Using these new powers he will ultimately confront the Emperor himself and fight for the freedom of all life. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original Star Wars trilogy was packed with action, comedy, special effects, fantastic adventures and even romance. In addition the grand story also dealt with some fairly thought provoking or weighty concepts such as destiny, patricide, racism and environmentalism. Indeed it is hard to find anyone who does not enjoy the movies at least a little and it is no wonder that they have become a cult in their own right. In the last census of the UK, many indicated their religion as Jedi in the hope that they would officially create a new belief system. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at the three movies in retrospect they are by no means perfect but the few faults are outweighed by their enjoyment factor. Weak acting and some truly cheesy moments may be forgiven in a franchise that gave us light sabers, talking dustbins and the best baddie of all time, Darth Vader. Slap on top all of the action and effects and you have one of the most powerful movie scores of all time - popcorn cinema gold.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	155	2011-03-26
156	1	15	\N	Batman Begins	<p>Reinventing a franchise that was dead, buried and rotting after the horror that was Joel Schumacher's Batman and Robin was never going to be easy but director Christopher Nolan (Momento) and writer David Goyer (Blade) have surpassed even the notoriously difficult to please comic book crowd's hopes by creating not only the best Batman film in the series but also the best comic book film adaptation ever made. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Batman Begins presses the reset button for the story of how Batman actually came to become Gotham's masked vigilante and future entries in the series will completely erase the mistakes of the past. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>We first meet the dishevelled Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale - American Psycho) in a Bhutan prison cell where the young billionaire spends his days fighting off fellow inmates and learning about the criminal mind. However before you can even say silly moustache, philosophising ninja Ducard (Liam Neeson - Kingdom of Heaven) has invited him up to his mountain top training facility to learn the ways of the force, or something similar. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>After an unfortunate disagreement about the best way to dispense justice and an even more unfortunate explosion, Bruce is on his way back to a magnificently realised Gotham City to take up the mantle of the Batman and combat wiseguy crime lords, greedy industrialists, corrupt cops and a very sinister psychiatrist. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Christian Bale actually looks a little podgy in the Batsuit and doesn't project as much menace in the role as Michael Keaton did but he still manages to steal away the crown as the best actor to take up the cowl thanks to his portrayal of the character so badly neglected by the other films, Bruce Wayne. Bale perfectly captures his early guilt and intensity and then later in the film his shallow billionaire act. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Michael Caine (Secondhand Lions) as sardonic butler Alfred and Morgan Freeman (Million Dollar Baby) as technologies expert Lucius Fox expertly hijack every scene they appear in and the film is all the better for it. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>The sheer talent that exists throughout the cast and the fact that everyone involved appears to be committed to Christopher Nolan's vision of Batman prevents the film from being dragged down by show-boating performances that so marred Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Sadly when the standard of acting is so high, any weak links in the production become ruthlessly exposed. Katie Holmes (First Daughter) playing love interest Rachel Dawes has all the chemistry of a lamp post with Christian Bale while Liam Neeson is given more bad lines in this film than in the rest of his career combined, which says a lot for a man who has appeared in a Star Wars prequel. </p> \r\n \r\n<p>The only other criticism that can be levelled at Batman Begins is that during the frequent bouts of fisticuffs Christopher Nolan insists on putting his camera at the heart of the fight presumably to make the audience feel the bone crunching intensity of the action. What they get instead is a migraine inducing blur where it is often impossible to distinguish whose fist is connecting with whose head, which is odd considering at least one of the protagonists is wearing a cape and full latex body suit. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>The unfortunate result of these misfiring action scenes is that the film, while exquisitely well made and brilliantly acted throughout, fails to feel epic, a problem that none of the film's four predecessors could ever be accused of. Thankfully three quarters of the way through the film the slow burn plot and scraps in dark alleyways give way to full blown blockbuster entertainment in the shape of the coolest car to appear on screen since a time travelling DeLorean. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>The Batmobile chase sequence is the spark that ignites the final half hour of the film, which despite its considerable running time blazed by in what seemed like an instant. Batman is back in town and I can't recommend a trip to Gotham City enough. The film makers cruelly finish with a glimpse of the challenges that lie ahead for the caped crusader and I can only pray that Nolan, Goyer, Bale, Caine and Co all get back together soon because I for one cannot wait.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	156	2011-03-26
157	1	20	\N	Sin City	<p>In a dark city saturated with corruption, vice and violence, the criminal element roams the streets trying to stay alive while the world goes to hell. Focusing on the story of three principal characters and how they overlap, Sin City is a twisted masterpiece that grabs your attention and pounds your senses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Frank Miller's cult graphic novel Sin City was drawn in a very bold style using very little colour and these stark visuals married well with the aggressive stories to make an impact. When Robert Rodriguez won over Miller and work began on the film, Rodriguez was keen on preserving the visual style and Miller was hired as director to help keep the style true to the material. The result is possibly the best ever adaptation of a graphic novel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The number of famous stars in this movie, even if only on screen for a short time, is nonetheless a feat in itself. Mickey Rourke (Man on Fire), Bruce Willis (Hostage), Jessica Alba (Honey), Clive Owen (Closer), Rosario Dawson (Alexander), Brittany Murphy (Little Black Book), Michael Clark Duncan (Daredevil), Josh Harnett (Wicker Park), Elijah Wood (LOTR), Rutger Haugher (Batman Begins), Nick Stahl (Terminator 3), Benicio Del Toro (21 Grams), Jaime King (Bulletproof Monk) are among the myriad actors in this movie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film Sin City is essentially a triptych similar in nature to Pulp Fiction in that the first few scenes to the movie actually introduce the third story in the film, itself the first of the many plots in strict chronological order. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first story follows street fighter Marv (Mickey Rourke) who awakes from a night of passion to find his one night stand, and only love, dead. Stitched up for her death and after a narrow escape from the police, Marv sets off on a quest for vengeance that will take him to sinister places, not only in Sin City but in his own mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter two follows the story of Dwight (Clive Owen), a man who finds himself caught in the midst of turf war between the reigning gang of hookers and the power hungry mob. Dwight works hard to try and avoid a massacre but is beginning to think that maybe a massacre is actually what's needed. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally the film rounds off with the story of a one great cop, Hartigan (Bruce Willis) who lost everything by protecting a girl from a psycho rapist. Released from prison and now an old man, Hartigan realises that his charge may once again be in danger and so he sets off to protect her from the villains while he still has some strength left. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each story is brutal and well shot. The use of black and white, the darkness of the city, the violent nature of the stories and the blunt dialogue make for a very bold film. Crammed with fight sequences, fine women in scanty clothing, dramatic sets and great camera work, this is more than your usual comic book adaptation, it is an art movie with wide appeal. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>To try and single out actors for particular praise is a difficult task. Mickey Rourke was the most memorable as brutal street fighter Marv while Elijah Wood finally sheds his friendly Frodo stereotype to play a really demented killer and Rosario Dawson as head hooker was seriously sexy as Gail, a killer queen. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Already this year we have seen some great films and I hope the trend continues. Sin City is original and bold. I award five stars because I haven't seen a film to match it for visual style and, in a genre bogged down with super heroes, this is probably the best comic adaptation since Batman. Rumour has it a sequel is in the pipeline. While I generally have reservations about sequels I hope Sin City 2 may match its predecessor and still provide a punch. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I recommend Sin City for fans of Tarantino movies, action flicks and classics such as Get Carter, Batman and The Maltese Falcon.</p>\r\n	5	2011-03-26	157	2011-03-26
159	1	15	\N	Valiant	<p>Having watched processions of the bloated dirty birds shuffle around wind swept town centres for years, Pigeons have never struck me as a species of any particular merit.  But as the on screen text at the end of the new computer animated adventure Valiant notes, dozens of the filthy pests have been recipients of the Dickin Medal set up to recognise animal bravery during the Second World War. Perhaps it was time to give these feathered rats another chance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Valiant, the titular hero voiced by a surprisingly dull sounding Ewan McGregor (Robots), is a bird of small stature but of big heart who moves from rural Britain to London at the height of World War Two to do his patriotic duty and join the Homing Pigeon Service. Joined by a similar group of misfits for training, including cowardly Bugsy (a well cast Ricky Gervais - The Office [TV]), the team are soon launched into flight to retrieve an important message from occupied France while trying to avoid the claws of the merciless German falcon General Von Talon.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Costing 21 million Valiant is the debut feature for the Ealing Studios-based Vanguard Animation. Although co-financed by Disney, the film will carry with it the hopes of British talent planning on competing with American animation powerhouses like Dreamworks and Pixar. On the evidence of this, their first attempt, the signs are not promising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the animation up on the screen is faultless, much of green and pleasant land on show is drab compared to the rich and varied tapestry seen in rival films like Finding Nemo. It is only in the second half of the film when the action moves to the grim bombed out ruins of Northern France do the animators stretch themselves and prove their abilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much of the voice talent employed on the picture prove confident and entertaining, particularly Hugh Laurie (Flight of the Phoenix) as dare devil squadron leader Gutsy, but they are let down by an unimaginative script, which might go unnoticed by the very smallest children but certainly won't by anyone older than eight or the adults who accompany them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lacking few moments of genuine wit the only gag that actually raised a laugh from the grown ups was during the interrogation of courageous POW (Pigeon Of War) Mercury (John Cleese - Shrek 2) by the menacing General Von Talon. Responding to the bird's stubborn refusal to give up his secrets Von Talon exclaims, "We have ways of making you Squawk!"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still a glut of jokes revolving around the dubious personal hygiene of pigeons in general and Bugsy in particular kept the kids cackling but for the most part adults forced into watching this film by their children will be glad that at less than an hour and a half long this disappointing animated adventure is mercifully short.</p>\r\n\r\n	2	2011-03-26	159	2011-03-26
160	1	16	\N	Guess Who	<p>Every father's nightmare is when the day arrives that he has to meet his daughter's new boyfriend.  For Percy Jones (Bernie Mac - Ocean's Twelve), it is no different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even before Percy has met Theresa's (Zoe Saldana - The Terminal) other half Simon (Ashton Kutcher - The Butterfly Effect) he is overly impressed by the boy's credentials.  Simon is hard working, smart and has a good solid career working for a top investment company.  What more could Percy ask for?  Theresa had painted an almost perfect picture of Simon to her family, shame she forgot to add the colour to that picture!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Theresa and Simon visit the family home for her parents' anniversary party, Percy gets more than what he bargained for!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with most fathers, Simon must endure the usual interrogation and quick fire questioning as well as promising to abide by Percy's strict rules on no canoodling under his roof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Poor old Simon can't seem to do anything right in Percy's (piercing) eyes!  Percy can't seem to see beyond his colour and Simon makes matters even worse by cracking black jokes, lying about his sports interest and by losing his job!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as with most romantic comedies, everyone manages to work out their differences and love prevails.  Aaahh!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mac and Kutcher are a great double act and the comedy flows well between them.  Mac is hilarious as the overprotective father and perfects some truly evil glares and disapproving looks.  On the receiving end, Kutcher performs well as the intimidated but headstrong boyfriend in a role that fits him well, matching his performance in Just Married.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guess Who was much funnier than I had expected and is full of side-splitting scenes, purely generated by the excellent comedic chemistry between the two lead actors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You will love this film if you're looking for a comedy along the lines of Meet the Parents or Meet the Fockers but with an added twist.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	160	2011-03-26
162	1	16	\N	Man of the House	<p>Man of the House is a fun teen crime farce about five pretty cheerleaders who witness a murder and are taken into the protective custody of one grumpy Texas Ranger. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>For lonely Ranger Roland Sharp (Tommy Lee Jones - The Missing), life is about work and no play and this unswerving devotion to his duty has made him a legend in the crime fighting community. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>While attempting to arrest a key witness for a high profile court trial, Roland's partner is shot by a mysterious sniper. In the confusion that follows, the witness seizes the opportunity to try and escape but before Roland can track him down the witness is also killed. Fortunately, the murder was witnessed by five young cheerleaders. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>To avenge his partner's attack and bring justice to the drug dealers, Roland must safely protect the new witnesses until the date of the trial. Despite honourable intentions Roland must now face his most challenging mission, living with five interfering self important socialites who speak an alien language of pop and fashion. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tommy Lee Jones is on familiar territory as a tough grizzly crime fighter with a reputation for blunt determination and lack of humour. In roles such as Marshal Samuel Gerard in The Fugitive and Agent K in the Men in Black movies, Tommy Lee Jones has become typecast as the merciless lawman. Man of the House differs only to try and cash in on this stereotype by placing our familiar hero in a teen comedy setting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As expected, Tommy Lee Jones was entertaining and showed his lighter side with some great moments of comedy. Meanwhile the five girls were all pleasing on the eye and offered some great pop jargon to entertain the teen audience. Christina Milian (Be Cool) as Anna, self appointed leader of the female force and Monica Keena (Dawson's Creek[TV]) as a neurotic med student, made the greatest impression. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>After watching the advert for this movie I felt it more than likely that the attractive cheerleaders would drive me insane with either pervy lust or murderous irritation. The film had its cringy moments but for the most part the girls were pretty and funny and were more appealing than infuriating and I was happy to share the Ranger's surprise at their amiability. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help balance out the female/male ration, Cedric the Entertainer (Be Cool) added some further comedy as an ex-crook-turned-preacher who provides Roland with information titbits to help him fight crime while legendary Texan R Lee Ermey (Full Metal Jacket) offered dry credibility as Roland's straight talking boss. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This movie can boast some good jokes, attractive women in scanty clothes and Tommy Lee Jones fighting the baddies. Sadly the premise to bring these ingredients together appeared to be an after thought and there was never any real doubt that cheerleading skills would help save the world. The baddies were only present briefly and the entire middle section of the movie focused more on the predictable emergence of the fuzzy character beneath Tommy Lee Jones' tough exterior shell. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall this was a fun no-brainer movie. If it had just a little bit more story or action it may have deserved a third star. Go see this film if you enjoyed movies such as Bring It On, Mean Girls or A Cinderella Story.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	162	2011-03-26
163	1	20	\N	Beauty Shop	<p>From the producers of Barbershop and Barbershop 2 comes a slight twist on the franchise. Confident sassy stylist Gina (Queen Latifah - Taxi), introduced in Barbershop 2, has moved to Atlanta where she works for egotistical European stylist Jorge (Kevin Bacon - The Woodsman).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After patiently taking wave after wave of subtle abuse from Jorge, Gina finally makes a break and decides to set up her own shop. With the support of her family and friends, Gina finds a tired salon and slowly transforms it into a relaxing beauty shop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Gina slowly overcomes smaller obstacles such as prejudiced staff and minor financial troubles, her success enrages her former employer Jorge who starts to make life more and more difficult for her. Elsewhere romance blooms with a lonely musician and at home Gina's daughter finds her own voice while Gina's niece starts to learn the importance of self-respect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result of some unintentional irony the plot and comedy of this film may be compared to the repeated conversations we each go through every time we visit a barber or hairdresser. The hair architects often banal chatting and old magazines may at a glance appear annoying but for the small time you are there you feel relaxed. Most probably it is because you know that you are at the mercy of the hair cutter, you cannot rush and you resign yourself to a small section of time outside of your normal hectic schedule. Similarly the story in Beauty Shop is thin and formulaic but that doesn't really matter. The humour isn't that original, but again that doesn't matter. You resign yourself to it and it becomes a pleasant break.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we prepare for a summer of action movies and big budget blockbusters it is nice to have a brief break in a formulaic comedy. Beauty Shop is a simple pleasure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Queen Latifah is lovely. I like her and, after the dumb but fun rehash that was 'Taxi', she returns for more mainstream comedy. After her breakthrough role as Mama in the Hollywood musical 'Chicago', Latifah has starred in a string of comedies including 'Bringing Down the House', 'Barbershop 2', 'Taxi' and now 'Beauty Shop'. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some may feel that Latifah's talents are wasted in such trivial comedy but why change such a winning formula? We know Latifah can act and sing, for instance, she would be a sure fire hit in a Jazz Biopic of Ella Fitzgerald, but why should she rush to prove it? Is her career in jeopardy? I don't have the figures but I imagine Queen Latifah is still a bankable star. So what if people want to stereotype her as an African-American big and proud independent woman. I sometimes agree that stereotypes are lazy terms for people with no time to form a real opinion. You carry on Latifah, we love ya!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we are here I suppose I should mention some of the other cast members. Mena Suvari (Trauma) pops up as a stereotype snob along with Andie MacDowell (Four Weddings) as loyal customer who follows Gina from expensive beauty palace to ghetto earth beauty shop. Meanwhile Kevin Bacon (The Woodsman) returns to light comedy as the camp self cantered stylist Jorge with a great accent and terrible highlights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally Alicia Silverstone (Scooby Doo 2) puts in a commendable performance as Gina's white chick friend Lynn who tries to connect with her new colleagues while Djimon Hounsou (Constantine) offers sex appeal as a mysterious musical electrician who offers Gina a few moments of romance away from the stress of the salon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you enjoyed 'Bringing Down the House', 'Barbershop' or the recent 'Man of the House', this film should entertain.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	163	2011-03-26
165	1	15	\N	Seed of Chucky	<p>Exactly which genre the makers of Seed of Chucky were aiming for never quite became clear during its short, but not short enough, running time. If I had to put the film into one specific category I would probably bypass horror, although the film is quite often bloody, and ignore comedy, although at times it is quite amusing, and definitively label the film as rubbish.</p>\r\n                                                 \r\n<p>The plot, for those keeping track of this fifth entry into the Child's Play series, has possessed doll Chucky (the voice of Brad Douriff - Alien Resurrection) in Hollywood working on a film about his own notoriety with his fellow plastic serial killer Tiffany. Also along for the ride is Glen (voiced by Billy Boyd - Lord of the Rings) as their androgynous offspring with an aversion to murder.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>With both parents swearing to give up their wicked ways for the sake of their son/daughter, they concentrate on escaping their miniature prisons by kidnapping film star Jennifer Tilly and director Redman (playing themselves) so they can perform a voodoo ritual and steal their bodies - more simple than it sounds.</p> \r\n \r\n<p>A pacifist Chucky would, however, make for a very dull slasher flick so random characters are decapitated with chicken wire or have their intestines pulled out into a great steaming pile to keep the audience quaking in their seats. Problem is that Chucky isn't scary any more, he is simple irritating and obnoxious. The director clearly wanted to make a successfully black comedy much like Bride of Chucky, the previous entry in the series. Sadly all that has been achieved, with what is hopefully the final entry into this stale franchise, is a crude unpleasant experience that left me checking my watch.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>On the other hand, watching an ex-member of S Club 7 (Hannah Spearitt - Seeing Double the S Club movie, obviously) try her damn hardest in a small role is fairly entertaining, especially when she is set on fire with a homemade flame thrower and plummets like a comet off a balcony. Seed of Chucky is a film of few pleasures but it has got a handful of moments such as this that will make the undiscerning, or the sick in the head, smile.</p>\r\n	1	2011-03-26	165	2011-03-26
166	1	15	\N	Cursed	<p>Siblings Ellie (Christina Ricci - The Adams Family) and Jimmy (Jesse Eisenberg - The Village) are driving home late one night when they are caught up in a car crash that leaves a fellow driver trapped in her crumpled car. Before they can help the unfortunate girl she is dragged screaming into the woods by an unseen creature that leaves the brother and sister with nasty scratches and an inexplicable need to howl at the moon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Werewolf films often feel like the poor relation of the most popular monster in the class, the vampire. Werewolves are difficult and expensive to portray on the big screen and the victim has a lot less acting range available to them once they change into a slobbering shaggy dog. In short, Vampires are a lot cooler. Cursed director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson clearly wanted to change all that and make the Wolfman glamorous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Craven and Williamson had previously collaborated on Scream and strictly follow the very successful formula laid down by that movie. The creature only eats attractive young actors and actresses who have previously worked on teen orientated television shows or have pop careers on the side. The film will be littered with references to other horror films and almost everyone will die in intricate ways that will result in gallons of fake blood being splashed all over the sets. And it is here that the film runs away with its tail between its legs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Someone, presumably at studio level, has seen a film with more than its fair share of problems, a film that will probably sink at the box office. In a vain attempt to grab a bit of extra cash they decided to completely neuter the film of gore in the hope that a lower certificate will bring in a larger, younger audience and thus more money. Unfortunately I'm bored of sitting through 'psychological' horror films like The Grudge that get 12A ratings, or through rubbish like Cursed where everyone gets mauled to death off camera. I came to see attractive people be torn limb from limb and ended up watching an extended episode of the Care Bears.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Talking of the Care Bears, nothing can destroy the tension in a monster movie more than revealing that the shadowy terror that has been gutting innocents left, right and centre has in fact been constructed from the bits left-over from a Blue Peter episode. Werewolves, it must be said, are the most difficult beasts to pull off and while Cursed's failure isn't as amusing as the enormous headed Alsatians of Dog Soldiers the monster does bare a striking resemblance to a Koala bear with pointy teeth. The creature's best angle is the view of a hapless victim cowering beneath a car, yes that's right, it has the most convincing wolfman ankles ever committed to celluloid. Quite an achievement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In defence of the film you could certainly spend a worse two hours at the cinema than by watching Cursed. The cast are all pretty good and the script has some amusing moments. The best scenes revolve around geeky Jimmy who finds that with the help of his werewolf enhanced abilities he might just be able to get the girl of his dreams. Nonetheless Cursed is an average film that didn't deserve to have so much talent and time lavished upon it only to be edited into oblivion.</p>\r\n	1	2011-03-26	166	2011-03-26
167	1	16	\N	The Pacifier	<p>Vin Diesel (The Chronicles of Riddick) swaps his usual macho fighting exterior for a slightly softer and cuddlier role in "The Pacifier".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diesel plays Navy Seal Lt. Shane Wolfe who has extensive experience of leading tough and life threatening missions in war zones such as Serbia and Somalia. During one such mission, while attempting to rescue top military scientist Dr Plummer (Tate Donovan - The OC), the rescue is compromised at the last minute and Shane is lucky to survive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feeling that he has failed Shane agrees to protect the young family of Dr Plummer from enemy agents seeking the late scientist's ground-breaking research. Mrs Plummer leaves town to try and locate where her husband's lost research and leaves her five children in the hands of Shane and the families wacky old babysitter, Helga (Carol Kane - Addams Family Values).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Shane, babysitting is a far cry from what he is used to. Shane's tactics with Plummer children are reminiscent of how he interacts on the battle field. He refers to each kid by a sequential code name and slaps a tracking device on each child's wrist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Plummer kids lack discipline and Shane is determined to knock them into line. He seems to get the most trouble from the teenagers Seth (Max Thieriot) and Zoe (Brittany Snow) who resent Shane's who they feel wants to replace their dad. Meanwhile middle child Lulu (Morgan York) keeps asking Shane uncomfortable questions such as "Why are your boobs so big?". </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite Shane's military experience he is unable to tame the tearaways and things are approaching a show down when unexpectedly the children realise almost too late that their lives really are under threat. From then on in it's a bonding movie with Shane helping each kid learn to overcome their current problems while they in tern help Shane find the human beneath his military exterior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vin Diesel's buff exterior helps him pull off some good fight scenes as the macho babysitter while becoming the fancy of a brownie troop. Similarly Diesel's comedy timing, unapparent in earlier movies, is spot on. Special note must be given to his effortless victory against Seth's megalomaniac wrestling teacher. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each of the children in the movie, all relative newcomers, gave good performances and credit also should be handed to Carol Kane as the crazy nanny who has a hilarious showdown with Diesel when she decides to quit. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fans of Arnold Schwarzenegger's "Kindergarten Cop" will enjoy this movie as this films similar structure holds much more humour. You will also enjoy this movie if you liked\r\n the recent teen comedy "Man of the House" or "Daddy Day Care".</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	167	2011-03-26
169	1	20	\N	House of Wax	<p>House of Wax is a modern remodelling of the classic 1953 horror of the same name. In this latest horror remake, two sets of siblings from different backgrounds collide in an artistic and morally challenging tale of disfigurement, isolation and love.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Not really! It's back to the woods with another bunch of pretty people just asking to be picked off one at a time by whatever disturbed possibly inbred maniac should happen to live in that part of rural America.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Pretty girl Carly (Elisha Cuthbert - The Girl Next Door) and her pretty boyfriend Wade (Jared Padalecki - Flight of the Phoenix) join their pretty friends Paige (Paris Hilton - Raising Helen) and Blake (Robert Ri'chard - Coach Carter) for a road trip to attend a big sports match. At the last minute they are joined by Carly's tough but still pretty brother Nick (Chad Michael Murray - A Cinderella Story) and his gimpy but fairly pretty friend Dalton (Jon Abrahams - Meet The Parents).</p> \r\n\r\n<p>As they take a short cut through the wild to reach their destination they decide to spend the night in some woods and then set off again early the next day. In the morning they wake to find one of their cars mysteriously out of action. While the others head off for the match, Carly and Wade decide to walk into deserted rundown town (as you do) to try and find a garage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's not long before they stumble inside the sinister House of Wax and the ghastly attacks start. After her boyfriend's early demise, Carly tries to survive while her friends return in groups from the sports match in search of her and her boyfriend (the latest exhibit in the House of Wax).</p> \r\n\r\n<p>I could tell you how each of the pretty young things meet their end but that'll be spoiling the fun, and this film is good fun. Personally I don't like slasher flicks but they can be funny when they don't take themselves too seriously and House of Wax was entertaining.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Undoubtedly the stars of this flick are Elisha Cuthbert (The Girl Next Door) and Chad Michael Murray (A Cinderella Story) as the brother and sister unravelling the horror and trying to survive the House of Wax. In support Jared Padalecki made a good impression before he was snipped, stabbed and plastered and Brian Van Holt (Man of the House) was particularly nasty as the psychopathic twin brothers, Bo and Vincent.</p> \r\n \r\n<p>The baddies are suitably remorseless and mucked up and the effects are generally very good. The chase sequences are fun and the pretty things are very pretty, Paris Hilton's sexy striptease before her dash to death was a particular highlight. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I recommend this film for fans of the Scream movies, The Amityville Horror or Texas Chainsaw Massacre.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	169	2011-03-26
171	1	15	\N	Mr & Mrs Smith	<p>There is a good chance that somewhere in the bowels of a Hollywood movie studio basement there is a colossal and ridiculously expensive supercomputer that has been programmed to design and create the perfect film. Human writers, you see, are so unreliable; they inevitably make films that not everyone likes! Fear not, however, the computer has come up with Mr and Mrs Smith, a film seemingly constructed to appeal to everyone, but with special emphasis on the shallow or sadistic.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>John Smith (Brad Pitt -Ocean's Twelve) and Jane Smith (Angelina Jolie -Alexander) have been married for five years but the spark has gone out of their relationship. They seem to be living  more and more separate lives, which is ironic since they actually have far more in common then either of them realise. Each secretly works as a contract killer at, what turns out to be, rival agencies. They only discover their spouse's extra curricular activities when they are double booked to kill Adam Brody (TV's Seth in The OC - thus clearly deserving death) in a desert ambush.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Clearly perturbed by this development and having received new orders from their shadowy bosses, John and Jane set out to bump each other off within the battle ground of their normal suburban life. Along the way Vince Vaughn (Be Cool) crops up and, as usual, is wasted in the role of one of John Smith's colleagues.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>This film comes straight from the Michael Bay school of filmmaking. Spray the audience with enough explosions, quips and hot people flashing skin and looking sweaty and they won't notice the underlining unpleasantness of the film. Pay attention, this movie is just as morally black as the more obvious Sin City, it just has more jokes in it. At one stage a gunfight that destroys the Smiths' house from the inside out degenerates into a punch up between estranged husband and wife. The audience laughed as the two stars beat each other with vicious kicks and head butts mostly because of the cartoon style responses of the characters to each assault. It felt like watching an episode of Tom and Jerry but in this case the violence was realistic, perpetrated by humans but without any physical consequences to show for it.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The film does have plenty of good moments during the middle hour as the couple tangle with each other in a variety of situations once their secrets become known. Typical marriage problems are traded as insults as often as punches. In particular a dinner scene in which Pitt's paranoid husband takes precautions against being poisoned is the film's highpoint. Unfortunately the script appears to have been at least two dozen pages short and the film spirals to an ending of meaningless action scenes. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>It's impossible to accuse Mr and Mrs Smith of not being professionally made, in fact it's so slick that it felt more like a two hour trailer than a normal feature film. You want funny moments? Gags are fired off like bullets and are genuinely amusing. You want action? Cars flip over out of control and buildings are blown up all over the place. You want romance? Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have genuine chemistry and I must admit they are very attractive people. You want a film with heart and some genuine human emotion? Sorry, wrong theatre.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	171	2011-03-26
173	1	20	\N	War of the Worlds	<p><i>"With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire over matter... Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic regarded the earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us." - </i><b>H. G. Wells (1898)</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Written at a time when England ruled the world, War of the Worlds told the fantastic and terrifying tale of a ruthless Martian attack on our fragile planet earth. One of the earliest Science Fiction stories regarding aliens from another planet, War of the Worlds remains one of the most engaging and frightening adventure stories in a genre crowded with poor imitations. </P>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, a hundred and seven years after it was penned, War of the Worlds has been rediscovered and revamped by none other than Steven Spielberg (Minority Report). With Tom Cruise, Dakota Fanning and Tim Robbins, Spielberg's refreshed "War of the Worlds" more than makes up for earlier misguided attempts at this classic tale. </P>\r\n\r\n<p>Tom Cruise plays Ray Ferrier, an everyday dock worker with a broken family. Ray generally looks out for number one and cannot connect with his two kids. One day Ray's town is struck by a strange electrical storm that cripples all electrical appliances and vehicles. Curious to investigate the damage caused by the storm, Ray walks into town and witnesses the emergence of enormous alien war machines. </P>\r\n\r\n<p>Within moments, the world Ray knew is being blown apart and he and his family are running for their lives, but where do you run when the whole world is under attack? Civilisation is under threat, anarchy is inevitable and the aliens are relentless. </P>\r\n\r\n<p>Spielberg is undoubtedly a master filmmaker and in this movie he excels at hitting the right emotional pitch and keeping the pace of the story moving while also throwing in fantastic visual effects. Focusing on the story of one everyday man and his children we share their perspective and experiences as they face the horror of the invasion. Helping to strengthen the connection with the audience, Tom Cruise (The Last Samurai) is on top form as the negligent dad trying to keep his family alive and Dakota Fanning (Hide & Seek) is simply amazing as his young daughter Rachel. In addition Justin Chatwin (Taking Lives), a relative newcomer, gives a good angst laden performance as Ray's elder son Robbie and Tim Robbins (Anchorman) is creepy as Ogilvy, a shell shocked survivor with a stark outlook and determined spirit. </P>\r\n\r\n<p>Spielberg has obviously read the original book and has tried to remain as authentic as possible to the original source material. The towering alien tripods with their relentless heat rays and whipping tentacles are brought to life with some great visual effects. The aliens themselves remain suitably strange, no biped humanoids with bug eyes. The aliens of War of the Worlds are three legged beaky faced creatures that look truly, well, alien. Alongside the effects Spielberg also takes time to focus on an aspect of the book missing from earlier adaptations, in particular the story of one man's reluctant descent into anarchy and ultimately his attack on a fellow man. </P>\r\n\r\n<p>For those out there who are expecting another 'Independence Day', think again. This film is more eerie and sinister. The realism of the settings and characters against the fantastic backdrop of an alien invasion is more closely akin to 'Signs' (2002) than any flash all action effects movie. Not that "War of the Worlds" isn't full of visual effects and great action, it is oozing energy, but where as Independence Day was an "America saves the world" romp, War of the Worlds is an intelligent and frightening vision of a world under siege. For this reason, with the combination of great movie making and blockbuster action, it is a brilliant movie. </P>\r\n\r\n<p>After all this praise I regret that there is a nagging problem with this movie. It is probably not an important objection therefore I will not waste your reading time with my rant here but let us just say that there are some holes in the story and some missed opportunities from the book. To discuss these holes (or mini chasms) would ruin what is an otherwise good movie. These errors sadly detract from the movie and I cannot award the fifth star.</P>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are a fan of either the popcorn classic alien flicks such as Predator or Independence Day, or alternatively the creepy carnivores of Alien or Signs, this is a movie for you. If you are a fan of special effects adventures and global disasters such as The Day After Tomorrow or Dawn of the Dead, then this is a film for you. If you enjoy intelligent science fiction films such as Minority Report, this is for you. In fact this film is good for everyone. Awesome!</P>\r\n\r\n	4	2011-03-26	173	2011-03-26
174	1	20	\N	Madagascar	<p>Alex is a self assured lion, happy with his life as the star attraction of Central Park Zoo, wowing his crowd of adoring fans. His friend Marty, a zebra, is less than content. He is ten years old and has never seen anything beyond the zoo and dreams of adventure. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>One evening after a chance encounter with some militant penguins digging under the wall, Marty decides it's time to explore the world and sets off through New York. Fearing for the safety of his friend, Alex, along with a sexy hippo named Gloria and a hypochondriac giraffe named Melman, sets off to rescue his friend. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you may imagine, the presence of a zebra, lion, giraffe and hippo on the streets of New York is a serious concern for the human population and the animals' night on the town is mistaken as a plea for freedom so the zoo keepers sedate the animals and ship them off for release into the wild.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a fracas aboard their ship and a course correction perpetrated by an ice crazed penguin, the four heroes find themselves falling over board into the ocean and eventually washed up on an uninhabited shore. They have arrived in Madagascar. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rest of the movie follows the adventures as the four domesticated animals try to fend for themselves and adjust to life in the wild all the while being annoyed by a community of partying lemurs. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a kids film full of talking animals there is some great comedy here to keep the adult audience happy. The computer animation is on top form adding some fresh ingredients to what is becoming an established genre and the movie is packed with popcorn references. Keep any eye out for references to Zoolander, American Beauty, Castaway, Lion King and many more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Providing the vocals for this madcap treat, Ben Stiller (Meet the Fockers) as Alex, Chris Rock (Head of State) as Marty, Jada Pinkett Smith (Collateral) as Gloria and David Schwimmer (Friends [TV]) as Melman, are all equally great. The star of the movie for me though was Sacha Baron Cohen (commonly known as Ali G) as Julien, King of the Lemurs. Dancing and shaking his stuff while manipulating the marooned zoo animals, Julien is hilarious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Madagascar is from the creators of Shrek and Shark Tale. Shrek was a five star classic while a similar format was starting to feel stale by the time Shark Tale was released. Luckily Madagascar offers something fresh and this raises it above some of its competitors. It's a good laugh with some great animation and adventure. It can also boast a subtle message regarding the effect of captivity on animals. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you like the comedy of Ben Stiller and Chris Rock or other animated features such as Robots, Shrek or The Incredibles, then I think you'll enjoy this movie.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	174	2011-03-26
177	1	15	\N	The Proposition	<p>The Burns brothers' gang are terrorising the nineteenth century Australian outback and their crimes have culminated in the rape and murder of a family of settlers. Tasked with bringing the men to justice Captain Stanley (Ray Winstone - Sexy Beast) surrounds and apprehends two of the brothers, Charlie (Guy Pearce - LA Confidential) and his younger brother Mikey, but the eldest and most ruthless brother Arthur is not among them.\r\n</p><p>\r\nCaptain Stanley offers Charlie the proposition of the film's title. He and his younger brother will go free if Charlie agrees to kill his eldest sibling Arthur. If he fails to do so by Christmas Day Mikey will be hanged. Charlie agrees and sets off on his mission to track down Arthur while navigating the dangers of the outback.\r\n</p><p>\r\nConsidering the predicament Charlie has been placed in, having to choose between the lives of his two brothers, it is difficult to justify why Charlie's relationship with Arthur is barely explored. Certainly we find out that both elder brothers care deeply for their youngest sibling and try and protect him from harm, but when Charlie finally catches up with Arthur there seems to be little to say between them. It comes as something of a disappointment that Arthur really is psychotic and that he does deserve to be either gunned down or strung up for his crimes.\r\n</p><p>\r\nInstead the movie dwells on Martha Stanley, played by Emily Watson (Gosford Park), who has little to do except shuffle around her home pleading for her husband to talk to her. Grizzled Ray Winstone plays the man in question but the pair do not seem like an obvious couple. In the film's first scene Captain Stanley comes across as a brutal thug as he beats his prisoners before offering his impossible choice. However, once he arrives back among his wife and the rest of the community of Banyon he becomes oddly impotent. Stanley mopes around and sulks as his authority is superseded by a meddling official played by David Wenham (The Lord of the Rings). This turn of events doesn't exactly set up much expectation for a showdown when the Burns brothers ride into town spoiling for a fight.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWith most of the actors seldom given the opportunity to express themselves with actual dialogue, John Hurt takes his opportunity and steals the movie with just two scenes. Playing a bounty hunter stalking the outlaws Hurt stumbles about and drools, managing to become the film's most memorable character in the process.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe film is packed with needless annoyances with Nick Cave's music in particular standing out and the arty moments seemed like padding in a film without enough plot to justify its length. The shots of the protagonists framed against Australia's yawning sky are impressive but suffer for being overused. In contrast to these moments of beauty, the county is portrayed during the rest of the film as an arid, bleached, windswept wasteland.\r\n</p><p>\r\nDirector John Hillcoat has severed up a bleak and brutal Australian western but the memorable moments are swamped by tedious characterisation and a plot that wastes a promising idea and setting by failing to build into anything remotely compelling.</p>\r\n\r\n	2	2011-03-26	177	2011-03-26
179	1	15	\N	Wedding Crashers	<p>Crash tells the story of interlocking situations surrounding the controversial topics of racism and stereotyping in Los Angeles.  The characters have to face and deal with the harsh realities of prejudice, corruption, crime and murder.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crash homes in on the lives of extremely different characters ranging from an upper class white couple, an inter-racial couple working as police detectives, two car jackers, a black TV director and his wife, a Mexican locksmith, a Persian shop owner, a rookie cop and a Korean couple.  The complete spectrum of racial backgrounds and the divides that come with that diversity are present in this film. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film centres round a series of crashes and collisions both physically and theoretically. Although the film has been advertised as dealing with issues of racism, this is not highly apparent but there is more of a deeper message on the issue of stereotyping and making rash judgements about certain cultural/ethnic groups. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crash gives the viewer a tough but harsh lesson in the consequences of quick judgement and the bleak reality of how prejudice can end up putting you in a life or death situation. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Writer/producer Paul Haggis has touched on the right emotions with the rich dialogue, sensitively balanced humour and gripping story lines.  The pace of the film builds up sufficient tension and the camera movement and direction helps to project the gritty real life situations. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don Cheadle (Ocean's Twelve) puts in an emotional performance as the accomplished Detective Graham Waters whose success goes unnoticed by his sick and distressed mother who thinks the world of his younger brother.  Matt Dillon (Herbie: Fully Loaded) is suitably cast as the sleazy and arrogant corrupt cop who, in his personal life, is struggling to deal with family heartache.  The story of locksmith Daniel (Michael Pena - Million Dollar Baby) is particularly poignant, as is Officer Hanson's (Ryan Phillippe - Gosford Park) regretful situation resulting from a mistaken snap decision.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watch this film if you like watching a web of stories running against the tide of the normal "beginning to end" film formats such as American Beauty and Magnolia.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	179	2011-03-26
180	1	20	\N	Fantastic Four	<p>A brilliant but broke scientist, Dr Reed (Ioan Gruffudd - King Arthur), has been researching solar storms and believes the energy they contain may help science better understand and manipulate DNA to open up a new era in medical research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To obtain the funding and resources to conduct his experiments Dr Reed, along with his friend Ben (Michael Chiklis - The Shield [TV]), reluctantly seek the help of an old college friend and billionaire businessman, Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon - NipTuck [TV]).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a short proposal presentation, Victor agrees to allow Dr Reed and Ben to use his orbiting space station to conduct the planned experiments but on the condition that they are overseen by Victor's beautiful head of genetic research, Sue Storm (Jessica Alba - Sin City). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past Sue and Dr Reed had a relationship that broke off due to his obsession with work. The chilly bittersweet tension between this couple soon feels mild when compared to a more openly hostile relationship between Ben and another surprise guest, Johnny Storm (Chris Evans - Cellular). Johnny is Sue's younger brother and the hot shot pilot who will take the team to space. Ben's gruff personality and rugged build contrast greatly with the buff, loud and flirtatious Johnny.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With so many complicated tensions between the characters this could easily turn into 'EastEnders in space' if it wasn't for a rather nasty accident.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A miscalculation of the storm's speed results in the space station being overwhelmed by the cosmic storm. Trapped inside and out of the station our team of heroes are bombarded with radiation. The mission is aborted and the team return home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Convalescing back on earth the specialist team try to come to terms with their failure in space while sitting things out in quarantine. It is here that they each realise the storm has radically altered their DNA empowering them with extreme abilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnny can generate fire and can fly, Sue can turn herself invisible and project force fields while Reed can stretch further than a blue whale's condom. As these three realise that life may never be the same, Ben has turned into an incredible hulk-like monstrosity and terrified of his transformation he runs home to seek solace with his fiance only to be rejected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trapped in his mutated form Ben contemplates ending it all when he inadvertently causes a major traffic accident on the Brooklyn Bridge. As the situation heads towards disaster, Ben, along with his three friends (who conveniently arrived in the nick of time) saves the lives of dozens of people and the team become an overnight sensation. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As all the happy superhero business is going on it is obvious we need a baddie. With all the attention on the four new heroes everyone has forgotten the fifth passenger in the space station, Victor. On his arrival back on earth Victor soon learns that he has also been altered by the storm. He is slowly turning into metal and can harness and project electricity. With his company going into bankruptcy due to Dr Reed's failed space mission and his own hunger for power, Victor sets off down a path to eeeeevil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since Batman made it big in the late eighties, super heroes have been back in a big way. Movie adaptations of every comic you can think of have either been made or are being green lit. Why then did it take so long for someone to tackle one of Marvel Comics oldest franchises? Apparently the studios have been keen to make the movie for years but have been waiting for the effects. Has it been worth the wait?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not too long ago the world was captivated by the X-Men movie from director Brian Singer. This was a new type of superhero movie where, instead of one hero and a couple of villains, we met an entire team of heroes each with different abilities. The mutants of the X-Men world were poorly understood by a humanity that shunned them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Fantastic Four, the situation is reversed. The heroes and their new abilities become big news and in fact the team have to lock themselves away while they learn to control their new gifts. Instead of hiding from people out of fear of being hurt, these heroes hide for fear that they may hurt people. This is good in principle but means the film sometimes feels slow and lacks action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The special effects are good and there are some great comedy moments but overall this film could have benefited from a bit more tension. The human stories (apparently needed in any action film these days) are alright, especially Ben's feeling of abandonment, but the film could have tied these together with a bit more action. The relationship between Sue and Reed was a bit weak and the baddie was a little one-dimensional but these are saved by the banter between Johnny and Ben, the script highlight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This movie was entertaining but falls short of the high benchmark set by the X-Men or the recent Batman Begins. This is a harmless action flick for teens and is set in a friendly world with comedy villains compared to some of the darker stories we may have gotten used to. The movie is good, not great, just good and the stage is set well for a fantastic sequel.  In fact, the stars of the movie hinted their interest in starring in the sequel at a press conference held on the day of the film's UK premiere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite my little grumbles I would still recommend that you go and see this movie. It has got some great comedy and special effects. Michael Chiklis is great as Ben "The Thing" Grimm and girls will love the sculpted body and cheeky wit of Chris Evans as Johnny "The Human Torch" Storm.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	180	2011-03-26
182	1	15	\N	The Descent	<p>Adventurous Juno (Natalie Mendoza), school teacher Beth (Alex Reid) and happily married Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) are three friends out on a white water rafting holiday in Scotland when a secret is revealed to Beth and tragedy strikes changing one of the women's lives forever. A year passes and the three friends become six when they again meet up to tackle nature. The setting this time is the Appalachian Mountains in America and the challenge is to descend deep underground into a labyrinth network of tunnels and caves, a place where more than one type of danger lurks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Director Neil Marshall announced his arrival into the world of horror movies three years ago with the highly amusing blood soaked monster flick <i>Dog Soldiers</i>. The film became a cult favourite and Marshall has followed this early success with The Descent, a film that has ditched the humour in favour of old fashioned tension and claustrophobia. The result is the\r\nscariest and quite simply the best horror you will see this year.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>As a horror, the film is actually far more effective in raising scares during its slow burning first hour as the girls face up to the possibility of death thanks to the irresponsible actions of one of the team. The struggle is contested between the six women and the cave itself, an adversary more than capable of generating a thick atmosphere of menace on\r\nits own without the aid of the figures lurking in the shadows. Certainly the carefully crafted dynamics among the group and the suffocating atmosphere are abandoned in the last half an hour in favour of violent pickaxe action but to be honest this too is tremendous fun as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the faults that can levelled at the film could easily have been corrected with a slightly larger budget, such as the scenery around the cave entrance looking a lot more like Scotland than the Appalachians and some of the computer effects being a bit on the ropey side, but generally the ambitions of the film are realised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike many horror flicks, the film doesn't collapse into a giggle inducing mess as soon as the big bad monster makes its appearance on screen. Director Neil Marshall has obviously learned from his previous experience on fellow creature feature Dog Soldiers where his pack of werewolves were ever so slightly less convincing than Animal from the Muppets. The creepers that lurk in the dark recesses of this cave may not be the most ambitiously\r\ndesigned menace ever created but the make-up is convincing and their ghostly appearances, especially in the shocking first attack, is very effective in jolting the audience out of their seats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Girls running around caves being chased by monsters may sound like a depressingly familiar night out at the cinema but don't dismiss The Descent; the film really is very good not just in terms of horror flicks but movies generally, with plenty of moments to keep the audience asking questions.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Why is Juno acting so shiftily? Will Sarah be able to handle the pressure she faces in the cave? Is Beth going to spill the beans? Will the irritating Irish lass get crushed by a rock? Do the other two girls have personalities or are they just making up the numbers? You may be surprised to find out that, despite the fact that you are watching a horror film, you will\r\nactually care about the answers to these questions and more!</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	182	2011-03-26
183	1	20	\N	Herbie - Fully Loaded	<p>A few weeks back I visited the cinema to watch a movie about a possessed vehicle and the strange relationship it developed with its driver. True that was an abysmal film about a psychotic aeroplane with artificial intelligence but at least it managed to attract a large crowd. This weekend I walked into a sparsely populated movie theatre to watch another film about a machine with attitude and the minimal turn out did not bode well. Luckily the film was really great fun!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those who have never heard of Herbie, shame on you! The basic premise is that an old VW Beatle, named Herbie, has human emotions that he uses to help young couples find love while also participating in races all over the world. In a series of movies between 1974 and 1982, Herbie was a car with character and the most shameless VW advert in history. Sadly the franchise slowly dried up except for some terrible TV efforts to resurrect it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After nearly twenty four years in retirement, the Herbie movie makes a great comeback with a great cast and some modern effects. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lindsey Lohan (Mean Girls) stars as Maggie Peyton, the granddaughter of a racing legend who has a date with dented destiny when she visits the local scrap heap with her father Ray (Michael Keaton - White Noise). As a graduation present Ray has agreed to buy Maggie any car she likes from the dusty rusty wrecks. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>After setting her sights on a nasty Nissan that falls foul of a falling car, Maggie reluctantly picks Herbie unaware of his great personality. It's not long before the Bug feels the need to stretch his...er...suspension and show Maggie what he can do. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>While on a test drive with nerdy friend Kevin (Justin Long - Dodgeball), Herbie shows Maggie what he can do when he kidnaps her (don't ask) and leads her into a one on one street race with Nascar egomaniac Trip Murphy (Matt Dillon - Crash). When the VW unexpectedly beats the reigning champion, all eyes fall on the Bug and its mystery driver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course Maggie, a wannabe race car driver, instantly falls in love with Herbie and, along with Kevin (who conveniently has a garage full of parts and loads of free time), they set about cleaning up a rusty Herbie and giving him a modern overhaul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like any teen movie the beautiful girl gets lumbered with a nerdy date (albeit a car) and while looking for something better (a real race car) she misses the great thing she has already. Only too late she realises her error and has to fight to regain Herbie and his trust, enter the car into a huge race and also find true romance. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the comical villain to upset this happy little story, Matt Dillon was an inspired choice to play the vain obnoxious racing legend Trip (as in 'ego') Murphy. Constantly outwitted by the little VW, Dillon camps it up as the baddie and adds the right level of sly nastiness needed in a kids film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The real star of this movie is Lindsay Lohan who gives a spirited performance as feisty Maggie, a character with a reckless streak of independence and thrill seeking that causes some tension at home. As the lead character she is captivating and good looking but for all those grown men who couldn't help but perv a little, relax she is 20. With a visibly growing cup size Lohan will soon need to ditch her 'Teen Girl' stereotype and make a move into more mature roles less she get left on the bench.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly Justin Long is also showing signs of maturity that may mean a career revaluation. All that working out in Easy Joes gym have added some bulk to his geeky frame and even though he still has a bowl haircut/mullet thing going on, he is looking less and less like the nerd in 'Galaxy Quest' and more like your average twenty seven year old. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both the leads have a good chemistry with each other and the VW Beatle and this makes for a happy and convincing, if silly, story that should entertain the kids and keep the adults amused. Using a mix of CGI and robotics, Herbie is a very expressive vehicle and has a funny personality  of his own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I doubt that this is the beginning of a franchise revival but it is a feel good kids movie all the same. I'd recommend this movie to kids who enjoy Knight Rider reruns and silly race movies such as Fast and the Furious or Torque.</p>\r\n\r\n	3	2011-03-26	183	2011-03-26
184	1	20	\N	Charlie and the Chocolate Factory	<p>Roald Dahl was a great writer, you can't deny it, and his kid's books had an appeal that would start a trend. Roald Dahl treated children like grown ups and grown ups like children. Dahl had a vivid imagination and used this to write some of the most memorable children's stories such as <i>James & The Giant Peach</i> and <i>The BFG</i>. These were great but by far the most famous is <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those unfamiliar with the story, Charlie is an ordinary boy who wins an opportunity to visit the chocolate factory owned and managed by the eccentric genius and confectionery maker, Willy Wonka. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>For many years the chocolate factory has produced some of the world's best loved chocolate and candy but nobody has seen Mr Wonka for some time or even entered the factory. One day, after years of solitude and mystery, Mr Wonka announces to the world that he has hidden five golden tickets in his chocolate bars. The five children who find a ticket will be allowed to visit the factory and one of the five will win a fantastic prize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within days the world is gripped with mania as children rush to buy all the chocolate they can afford. Four tickets are discovered by four dissimilar and dysfunctional children, each to the irritation of Charlie who so longs to win a ticket. Alas poor Charlie only ever receives one bar of chocolate a year so his chances are almost as slim as he is but fate and destiny step in and Charlie finds the fifth ticket and so joins the other four children for an amazing adventure. </p>\r\n\r\n<pp>Nobody has seen Willy Wonka in years, nobody has stepped foot in the factory for years, nobody could ever guess what weird and wonderful spectacles there are to behold in Wonka's factory. Of the five children who enter the factory, only one will win the mysterious prize. How they will win it and what fate may befall them in what has become one of the most famous children's stories of all time.</p>\r\n\r\n<b>Mike Teavee:</b> "Why is everything here completely pointless?" <br>\r\n<b>Charlie Bucket:</b> "Candy doesn't have to have a point... that's why it's candy."<br>\r\n\r\n<p>The story of Charlie and his visit to the famous factory has been made into a movie before and with great success but after thirty four years it's about time for a refresh and who better to bring such a surreal tale to life than gothic director Tim Burton (Big Fish).</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Tim Burton's visual flair perfectly blends with Roald Dahl's dark humour. As with his earlier films <i>Edward Scissor Hands</i>, <i>The Nightmare Before Christmas</i> and, most recently <i>Big Fish</i>, Tim Burton has shown he can bring the bizarre and magical to life in a very real way. He may use effects but he also concentrates on the small details in costume and set design sand as well as the acting of his cast, to really capture the spirit of a story. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is arguably one of the best kid's films I have seen in years. Visually delicious, this movie has chocolate waterfalls, intelligent squirrels and an army of dancing Oompa Loompa's. Some may criticise small changes to the story or ponder over the morality of cow whipping but, all in all, this is a great film and light-hearted fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cast as the eccentric chocolate wizard Willy Wonka, Tim Burton alumni Johnny Depp (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow) puts in another fantastic performance. No stranger to weird roles, Depp mixes slapstick comedy and sharp one line comments with a grand flair that makes an already inspirational character even more memorable. In fact, he is so good that he could easily carry the whole film on his own.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>To contrast the insanity of Wonka, young Freddie Highmore (Finding Neverland) as Charlie Bucket once again stands head and shoulders above his peers. The character of Charliet is fundamentally not fantastic. He comes from a poor family and wears drab hand me down clothes, in short he is meant to be an everyday child albeit kinder than most. This relatively bland character demands a great deal from an actor and Freddie Highmore acted so well that he stood out against his lavish surroundings and more erratic young co-stars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In support James Fox (The Prince & Me), David Kelly (Laws of Attraction), Missi Pyle (Big Fish), Christopher Lee (Star Wars) and Helena Bonham Carter (Big Fish), among many others, all put in admirable performances. And once again Danny Elfman provides a spooky yet fun musical score.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory exceeded my already quite high expectations and I cannot recommend it highly enough. Some may have little quibbles with minor alterations to the plot (as they always do), especially with the whole "Wonka's family" angle, but these additions only add to a great story and make for an even more well rounded movie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take the kids and treat yourself to a great big bag of sweets and enjoy this movie. This film is highly recommended for anyone with a sense of humour and especially for fans of either Tim Burton or Johnny Depp.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	184	2011-03-26
188	1	23	\N	The Devils Rejects	<p>Full of southern American stereotypes, predictable plotting and capped off by a ludicrously clichd ending, The Devil's Rejects is modern horror at its most stale. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rob Zombie has been touted as new horror talent after the success of his debut <i>"House Of 1000 Corpses"</i> (2003). Whereas 'Corpses was gory, dumb and fun, The Devil's Rejects tries for a more serious tone, but ends up coming across as twice as stupid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It says a lot about the quality of what Zombie has brought to the film that the soundtrack of 60s and 70s Southern blues rock, none of which was produced by him, is the most enjoyable thing about it. However, the plot of The Devil's Rejects is as familiar as the riffs and acoustic strums of its retro soundtrack. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a mockumentary 'Police discover house of horrors' opening sequence - all black and white handheld camera and moustachioed good ol' boy cops reeling in stereotypical horror - the murderous Firefly family from Zombie's debut are on the run. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their house of horrors is a crime scene, and the matriarchal Mother Firefly is incarcerated at the pleasure of Texas' finest. The three remaining Firefly family members, grubby clown Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig - Kill Bill: Volume 2) and bickering, psychotic brother and sister combo Otis (Bill Mosely - Anderson's Cross) and Baby (Sheri Moon - Toolbox Murders) head out for a murderous last hurrah. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tracking the threesome is Sheriff Wydell (William Forsythe - The LA Riot Spectacular), a cop hell-bent on avenging his brother's death at the hands of the Firefly's.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The desert landscape may be shot with style, and some of the violence has a wince-factor, but The Devil's Rejects doesn't work because you just don't care about any of the characters. Take the pivotal scene in which Otis and Baby kidnap a Country & Western group in a grimy motel. What could be a claustrophobic disturbing piece of horror soon becomes boring because you cease to care about the fate of this dumb bunch of hicks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What happens to them is inconsequential, because they're just Texan stereotypes phoned in from countless other movies. Much has been made of this scene and the level of violence in the movie as a whole, but it is all so predictable that any impact is lost. By the time this over-hyped and vacuous movie comes to its suitably second-hand ending, death at the hands of a bunch of southern serial killers will seem preferable to ever seeing it again. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you liked Creep, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) or any other abysmal horror film, then you will probably find this film bearable.  If you are a true horror fan who likes to be scared and kept on the edge of your seat like with The Descent, The Amitytville Horror and The Grudge, avoid this film like the plague.</p>\r\n	1	2011-03-26	188	2011-03-26
191	1	20	\N	Dark Water	<p>What on earth is the problem with the big budget horror movie market these days? It seems the Hollywood studios are so scared to take a gamble on anything fresh that they will only green light pretty looking but damp remakes of cult classics, or rehashes of recent Eastern horrors. Why can't they try something new? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dark Water is the latest Japanese horror movie to be regurgitated by the west and centres on the story of young divorcee Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly - The House of Sand and Fog) and her daughter Ceci as they move into a new apartment block. Dahlia has an unsettled past and is determined to give her daughter the best possible upbringing, amid custody battles and the disturbed new property. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trying to keep hold of a job and care for Ceci at the same time places a strain on Dahlia's frail nerves. In their new apartment this delicate balance starts to fall apart as Ceci develops an imaginary friend and the flat is repeatedly flooded in dark water from the abandoned flat above. As Dahlia investigates the source of the water and her daughter's strange behaviour, she witnesses sinister occurrences and haunting memories of her own past that start to fracture her reality and leave her a nervous wreck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with most horrors we expect a steady escalation of strange events and dark imagery with an underlying sense of tension and suspense leading us all toward a final confrontation. Unfortunately despite great acting and some moody set pieces, this film never really provokes any kind of fear at all. It is as damp as the subsidence the film centres upon and ultimately flounders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it wasn't for some fine acting from the great cast and some great visuals I would rank this even lower than Creep (1 star). Thankfully Jennifer Connelly gives one of her best performances to date and the supporting cast of Dougray Scott (To Kill A King), Pete Postlethwaite (The Shipping News), John C. Reilly (The Aviator) and Tim Roth (To Kill A King) are all exceptional. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what went wrong? Director Walter Salles didn't manage to get any suspense or tension into the film. The few curious incidents in the story were too spaced out and uneventful to build any lasting horror and the eventual crisis was rather lame. In his defence the story of Dark Water is too similar to the recent 'Hide and Seek' or 'The Ring' to make any impact and audiences familiar with these films would be bored by the lack of originality. Basically the film shouldn't have been made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why does Hollywood keep trying to revamp a tired formula to try and find new scares? True, the American film industry has the money to plough into these movies and I suppose by re-shooting movies in English with big name stars they do become easier to digest, but sadly they often lose something in translation and end up dreary rather than frightening. Also the fans of the Japanese horror genre are increasingly seeking out the original movies and, what with a slow increase in foreign films, studios seem slow to realise that they cannot just try and repackage what is a fairly recent movie in the hope no one has seen it.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Hollywood! Wake up, go out there and try to find us a new type of horror. The popcorn crowd is tiring of remakes. Give us something new! </p>\r\n	1	2011-03-26	191	2011-03-26
192	1	15	\N	Night Watch	<p>Fantasy films are generally ridiculous. It isn't their fault, they can't really help it. You get the odd one or two that make it like The Lord of the Rings, but most sadly turn out like Dungeons & Dragons. They tend to deal with things that are a bit silly, things like magic, incredible powers, monsters and the end of the world. The only thing that could make a film that deals with magic, incredible powers, monsters and the end of the world even sillier would perhaps be if it were entirely in Russian. Thank god then for Nightwatch, which despite including all of the above is absolutely brilliant!</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Unknown to mankind there exists an uneasy truce between the supernatural forces of good and evil, a truce that both sides only keep because of the devastation that would result if open hostilities resumed. There is a problem however, the truce is close to breaking with both sides using underhand methods to undermine their enemies and a prophecy which predicts the balance of power will swing decisively one way or the other. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Into this world comes Anton, a man with extra sensory powers struggling to exist with his past and his present in modern day Moscow. He is a member of the Nightwatch, a group who use human bait to try and entrap dark others into breaking the truce. When a mission goes wrong, Anton is forced to use lethal force to defend himself and thus becomes a hunted man by the forces of darkness. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering the language barrier and the very complex world that Nightwatch inhabits, the film's most impressive feature is that it manages to sink its fangs into the viewer right from the start with Anton's business meeting with a sinister old lady who can't be allowed to clap. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The middle section of the film does contain plenty of exposition as the major plot threads begin to build. Instead of introducing an unnecessary character in Anton's feathery companion Olga, who has little to do after her frankly bewildering introduction, the film could have greatly benefited from the inclusion of an extra action scene to maintain the early pace, but this is a minor flaw. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>One aspect of the film that certainly doesn't contain any flaws is the special effects which are extraordinary. Every single one of them is innovative, from the flocks of swarming birds to the medieval bridge arching over the skyline of contemporary Moscow. What the filmmakers have achieved puts to shame the effects that much of Hollywood churns out at ten times the budget. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>At times the plot doesn't manage to keep all of its balls flying in the air. The story of the cursed girl and the vortex that threatens to destroy the world never builds to a satisfactory climax but the story of the boy who is used by both sides as vampire bait generates some moments of genuine tension. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>When choosing your next cinematic experience this low budget Russian language fantasy may not immediately leap to the top of your list as a great night out at the movies but Nightwatch is well worth taking a chance on. It is like nothing you will have ever seen before and in today's identikit world of film that can only be a good thing.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	192	2011-03-26
196	1	27	\N	The Honeymooners	<p>\r\nOn the far side of the moon a lonely astronaught, Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell - Frost/Nixon), is getting excited about going home and seeing his lovely wife and their baby girl. Sam has been working alone at the lunar mining base for nearly three years and his only company has been a chirpy computer named Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey - 21).\r\n</p><p>\r\nSam's long tenancy and his solitude have allowed him time to improve himself and he is no longer the hot head astronaught that set out for the moon. He is a more reserved man who cares for his plants and wiles hours away slowly building a model of his home town. Heightening Sam's isolation, there is a problem with the radio and while he can receive messages from earth he cannot send any.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOne day while making a coffee Sam's peaceful and repetitive life is upturned when he sees a teenage girl sitting in his chair. So shocked, he slips and burns his hand. Sam is obviously worried he has been alone for too long. A few days later another hallucination causes him to crash his moon buggy into a mining machine and he loses consciousness.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAs Sam awakes he finds himself in the infirmary with the doting Gerty tending his wounds and advising rest. As Sam recovers he notices one of the mining machines is broken and inoperative. Gerty, mindful of Sam's fragility, initially forbids Sam from taking the moon buggy out again but relents. This act sets up the rest of the film.\r\nAs Sam goes out in the buggy to investigate the damaged machine he sees a crashed moon buggy. In the driver's seat is a dust covered space suit and inside is an unconscious injured astronaught that looks a lot like Sam.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIs it loneliness, is it a time loop, is it a clone, does he have a twin, is it some kind of delusion caused by head trauma, or is it an alien imposter stealing his identity? So the story begins and there are many little revelations and set pieces that suddenly propel this gentle science fiction movie forward.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn the central (only) role as Sam, Rockwell is on top form. As the original Sam starts to communicate with his young feisty doppelganger/hallucination/alien we see how much Sam has changed since he first went to the moon and get glimpses into his relationship with his wife. As the tension mounts with more and more revelations these two Sam's react differently. This must have been a great challenge and Rockwell delivered essentially two great performances. The only other significant character is Gerty, a boxy computer terminal that navigates the corridors offering assistance and concern in a smooth Spacey (pardon the unintentional pun) accent with only a small smiley to offer visual expression. Gerty is a lovely computer, at once an all knowing genius like Hal (2001) but with much more warmth.</p><p>\r\n\r\nThe individual story concept at play in this movie is not new and the budget does not allow for fantastic effects but the way these ingredients are all put together, and the fine acting, make this a superb film. What it lacks in originality it makes up for in heart. The film's director, Duncan Jones - Whistle), deserves credit for making a one man play into what I am sure will be a cult classic.\r\n</p><p>\r\nHow do I make comparisons without giving away twists? I would recommend this film to fans of <i>Alien</i>, <i>Bladerunner</i>, <i>Matrix</i>, <i>Capricorn One</i>, <i>Dark Star</i>, <i>Sixth Day</i> and <i>2001</i>. That should offer some guidance but not ruin surprises.\r\n</p> \r\n	9	2011-03-26	196	2011-03-26
197	1	20	\N	Red Eye	<p>After a long and successful stint of horror classics and few a lesser hits, director Wes Craven (Scream, Cursed) has locked away the monsters to try his hand at a traditional thriller. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>An introverted yet attractive hotel manageress, Lisa (Rachel McAdams - The Wedding Crashers) is taking the last flight home to Miami and her journey is fraught with problems. Her flight is delayed, fellow passengers are yelling at staff and an annoying lady has accidentally spilt an iced coffee all over her blouse.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>After this little sequence of irritating mishaps our heroine believes she may have found a moment of happiness when a charismatic fellow passenger, Jackson (Cillian Murphy - Batman Begins) buys her a drink and showers her with compliments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Lisa boards her plane she is surprised, and at first relieved, to see Jackson has the seat next to her and so she sits down and prepares for her flight and maybe a hint of romance. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is where the little voices in Wes Craven's head kick back in. Enough of the romantic tosh, gives us some scares! Jackson finishes his compliments and moves onto the thrilling and frightening truth, he is a mercenary planning a terrorist attack and unless Lisa helps him, he will kill her innocent dad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lisa is now thrown into a one-on-one battle of wits as she tries to save her father and avert disaster while seated next to a homicidal maniac in economy class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best feature of this movie is also its fatal weakness, namely the trailer. A teasing premise of potential romance is unexpectedly shattered into a fast paced thriller. Sadly the film offers little that you haven't already seen in the advert and, therefore, instead of a simmering plot full of suspense, the audience instead tries to remain focused for the next exciting titbit of action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy put in admirable performances, yet their characters are not given enough depth of dialogue to make any connection and therefore the whole film rests on the action. Sadly the advert spoils this by essentially showing you in quick succession everything that happens in the film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Redeye is aptly named, the slow delivery of what should be edge of the seat thrills makes you tired and the few moments of brilliance are numbed by the tedium between. A far cry from the tension invoked in a classic Hitchcock movie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Akin to "Cellular" this film has some good ingredients but just can't hit the spot. Maybe a bit more mention of the violent history that created Jackson or the tragic and painful past that forged Lisa would make this film gritty enough to stick in the memory but, as it is, like the turbulent flight the film centres on, this is one you'd be better off sleeping through.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	197	2011-03-26
199	1	15	\N	Four Brothers	<p>When pillar of the community and foster mum Evelyn Mercer is gunned down during a convenience store robbery in snow-covered Detroit, the four adopted Mercer boys she raised herself return home for her funeral and to seek out her killer.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Action films built in the shape of Four Brothers clearly aren't designed to be intellectually stimulating and this film certainly doesn't disappoint. Shooting, shouting, screaming, swearing and looking moody takes up ninety percent of the screen time. The boys also spend a fair bit of time pointing out that their own particular brand of extreme violence is necessary to get justice for their peace loving mum.</p> \r\n \r\n<p>Perhaps if the audience were given a chance to witness the relationship the boys had with their foster mother it might have been easier to sympathise with their loss. Instead the lovely old dear is blown away in the first scene and much of the film that follows is simple; the supposedly reformed young men executing anyone who has the slightest knowledge of her murder.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Although the maternal relationship is largely ignored, the closeness of the brothers is established effectively. The four men constantly banter, some of which is amusing and some of which is not. A lot of the jokes seem to be insults targeting gays and women which, combined with the film's occasionally sadistic violence, all adds up to a generally unsavoury experience.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Mark Wahlberg (The Italian Job) provides the weakest performance of the four main characters, which is a shame considering he has the largest amount of screen time. Andre Benjamin (Be Cool) further proves that after his good performance in Revolver, there is more to him than singing ability. Tyrese Gibson (Flight of the Phoenix) and Garrett Hedlund (Troy) make up the sibling numbers while Chiwetel Ejiofor's (Dirty Pretty Things) talents as the villain of the piece are utterly wasted when compared to the performances he has given in other recent and more notable films.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Occasionally the plot attempts to add some twists and misdirection as the boy's interrogation / torture of random suspects gets closer to the truth, but they don't add anything remotely surprising to the mix of macho posturing and swearing.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The snow-covered decay of Detroit's ghetto does give the film a suitable backdrop and a car chase through a blizzard is one of the film's highlights, despite the vicious finale to the pursuit. Action fans won't be disappointed by the carnage wreaked and even I must admit that a blazing machine gun exchange at the family home is the most exciting shoot out put to screen this year but Four Brothers is still brutal, harsh and unpleasant. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Brainless action films can be a lot of fun but it would be nice if it were easier to distinguish between the heroes and the villains.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	199	2011-03-26
202	1	20	\N	Corpse Bride	<p>Nervous young Victor is being forced to marry a girl he has never met. Luckily the girl is also nervous and their gentle personalities warm to each other moments before the dreaded wedding rehearsal. As this pair of star crossed lovers practice their wedding vows before their overbearing families, poor Victor keeps forgetting his words. Enraged at the repetitive failure of the groom, the vicar sends Victor away to practice his vows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As our stressed hero wanders the local woods his theatrical recitations go too far and placing the wedding ring on a small twig Victor successfully completes his vows. All of a sudden the ground creaks and Victor realises what he thought was a twig is actually the finger of a skeleton. Victor has just married the corpse bride, a deceased young lady who is delighted at her new love and hopes to make the marriage work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Torn between his new bride, two warring families and his growing feeling for his true intended, poor Victor is dragged on a romantic comedy of errors as he tries to find a solution to his predicament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The characterisation of both Victor and his undead wife does allow the audience to appreciate each individual's unique perspective on their surreal predicament but alas this may be a little complex for younger children. Saying that, I think kids will enjoy the colourful afterlife and the occasional musical numbers along with the oddly shaped characters both living and dead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gothic style and imaginative set designs set this animation apart from the very recent "Wallace and Gromit" movie from Aardman. Similar to Tim Burton's earlier movie "A Nightmare Before Christmas", Burton's creative team have created the characters of Corpse Bride, although distended, to have very human characteristics. I feel that with so many computer generated animations out there credit must be given to any animation team who still have the patience to work with stop motion photography.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnny Depp (Finding Neverland) provides the soft voice of Victor while Helena \r\nBonham Carter (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) offers her perfect English accent as the Corpse Bride herself. Other notable voices include Michael Gambon, Joanna Lumley, Christopher Lee, Emily Watson, Albert Finney, Michael Gough, Richard E Grant and the ever lovely Jane Horrocks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Corpse Bride is spooky and funny with a great vocal cast and some great set pieces. Maybe a bit macabre for the wider youth audience, I think this film does have a unique appeal that separates it from other recent animations. Then again I am a massive fan of Tim Burton movies so maybe I am biased. The film does have some weaknesses, it takes a little while to get going and there isn't a great deal of action for what is a kid's story at the end of the day. Weighing it all up, I think this is a nice film and would recommend it to fans of "Sleepy Hollow", "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" and "Beetlejuice".</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	202	2011-03-26
203	1	20	\N	A History of Violence	<p>In a sleepy town somewhere in Middle America, a humble caf owner, Tom Stall, lives a quiet life with his loving wife, moody teenage son and little daughter. Tom's peaceful little world is about to get shattered to pieces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Preparing to close his caf for the night Tom (Viggo Mortensen - Hidalgo) is visited by two out of town maniacs who proceed to threaten him and his customers at gun point. As the reality of the situation and the sadistic nature of the gangsters sinks in, something within Tom finally snaps. Within seconds he has disarmed and killed both gangsters and finds himself hailed as a local hero.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few days after the attack on the caf, recovering from his injuries, Tom is visited at the caf by another group of strangers from out of town. Compared to these new visitors, the dead attackers were kittens. Tom's new customers have an alternate take on Tom's past and they seem intent on staying around to disrupt the gentle routine of Tom's life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Intimidated by these new arrivals, Tom and his wife Edie (Maria Bello - Assault on Precinct 13) soon learn that the one eyed man (Ed Harris - The Human Stain), obsessed with Tom, is a serious gang land criminal from Philadelphia working for the mob. As Tom and Edie try to protect their family Tom must confront his persecutors and come to terms with the truth before he loses not only his mind but his family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the face of it this should be a great movie. The story, simple but emotive, contains the promise for violence and suspense while the great cast and director have the talent to bring the film to the screen. Unfortunately the film lacked the spark to make it brilliant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the lead role as Tom Stall, Viggo Mortensen had to deliver both a gentle, humble persona and also a more vicious counterpart. The transition between these two personalities forms the backbone of the movie. At the same time Maria Bello must act the part of the loving wife who tries to add spice to the marriage and ultimately learns her husband's painful past. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mortensen proves once again that he is capable of leading a major film and Maria Bello practically steals centre stage. Viggo, as Tom Stall, projects the frustration and fear of Tom's character while in other scenes you are chilled by something sinister behind his piercing eyes. Bello compliments this dichotomy by showing the struggle of a woman who learns the love of her life has a hidden past and the choices she has to make upon realising the truth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is good chemistry between Mortensen and Bello adding to the sincerity of the movie. The actors share several risqu scenes that may take the audience by surprise and these are mixed with highly emotive scenes where the story really takes shape. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In support Ed Harris (The Human Stain) is suitably menacing as fearless, eyeless, Carl Fogarty who persistently pesters Tom to the point of despair and newcomer Ashton Holmes gets his own side story as set upon teenage son Jack who confronts his attackers akin to his father only to be slapped in a moment of hypocrisy by a father who apparently condemns violence.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately all the best performances cannot save the film from a crawling pace and a lack of real tension. The strong story premise is stretched thin over a long playing time with vast expanses of moody settings between the infrequent bouts of violence, sex or a combination of both. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I got the impression the slow pace of the movie was meant to draw you into the characters more and make you empathise with their predicament. Sadly the film felt too long and slow, the eventual climatic moments are so long overdue that they barely raise a pulse.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed films on the dotted line between <i>'Walking Tall'</i> and <i>'Taxi'</i>.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	203	2011-03-26
204	1	20	\N	Oliver Twist	<p>After a few years on the shelf it's time to polish off another literary classic and slap it up on the big screen. This year we have already seen a lavish 'Vanity Fair' and more recently, a revitalised 'Pride and Prejudice'. Now, as autumn closes in, it is time for something a little more sinister, Charles Dickens' "Oliver Twist". </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I must admit I visited the screening of Oliver Twist with some trepidation. I have tried more than once to read the book with little success and as a kid I was scared of Oliver Reed's character, Bill Sykes, in the classic musical movie "Oliver" (1968). Luckily both my failure to read the book and my single viewing of the loose musical adaptation left me a little unclear of the story and so, for me, this movie was a delight. I have been told by fellow viewers that Polanski's "Oliver Twist" is the most sincere movie adaptation to date. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those unfamiliar with the tale, Oliver Twist (Barney Clark) is a young orphan who incurs the wrath of his orphanage when he asks for more food one dinner time. Labelled as a trouble maker, the orphanage quickly sends Oliver off to work with an undertaker where he soon gets into even more trouble. Deciding he is better off alone, Oliver sets off towards London on foot with no money and no idea what he'll do when he gets there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Half starved and near dead Oliver arrives in London and soon falls in with the friendly scamp, the Artful Dodger (Harry Eden), who offers him shelter in the home of old Fagin (Ben Kingsley - Thunderbirds). Nave to the harsh realities of life, Oliver does not realise that he has stumbled headlong into a den of thieves. However "needs must" when you are an impressionable half starved kid and luckily, despite his crookedness, Fagin has a heart (somewhere) and the friendly hooker Nancy (Leanne Rowe) can see the innocence of Oliver buried beneath the layers of grime. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>After regaining his strength with sausages and bread, Oliver is taught the tricks of pick pocketing and is all set to join Fagin's band of thieving little rascals. On his first day on the street Oliver innocently gets caught up in the bungled theft of a handkerchief and finds himself in the police station. Cleared of charges, Oliver is taken in by the kind Mr Brownlow (Edward Hardwicke - Love Actually) who hopes to educate Oliver and save him from the streets. The kind turn of fate sadly cannot last for long.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unsure what information Oliver may divulge to the police or his new found patron, Fagin and his ruthless protg Bill Sykes (Jamie Foreman - Layer Cake) decide upon a dark but simple solution. If Oliver is silenced once and for all, they may be saved from "the clink" and get back to their business like usual. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story of Oliver Twist is timeless. Similar to that dingy fog-filled Victorian London, our modern metropolis also hides the abuse of children trained to steal for drugs, run money for gangsters or worse, sold into prostitution. This truth, horrible to contemplate, is the reason why 'Oliver Twist' remains a classic. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barney Clark, an unknown kid from Hackney, puts in a good first time performance as Oliver. Mute for  the majority of the movie, his few lines are delivered well and his innocent features compliment his character's naivety. As Fagin, Sir Ben Kingsley steals the show as the wretched crook that takes in Oliver and seals his fate. A role that demands a dash of eccentricity, comedy and conflict, Ben Kingsley claims to have been preparing for years to play Fagin. Sadly Jamie Foreman as Bill Sykes couldn't deliver as well as his esteemed peer. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The "Bill Sykes" character is meant to be ferocious but, in this instance, Forman's occasional dash of overacting made the delivery seem a little forced and instead of instilling a sense of menace he instead became a laughable villain. Luckily this one blip in the acting is diluted by the talent of Mr Kingsley and the remaining cast. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leanne Rowe (Where the Heart is [TV]) as cheeky but kind Nancy has a few difficult scenes to deliver and does so with sincerity and should be watched as a rising talent awaiting a shot at centre stage. Also in support, young Harry Eden (Peter Pan) looks like he is having great fun as the Artful Dodger using slight of hand and a bit of flare to look all too convincing as the pick pocket extraordinaire. Alongside this youthful cast, Edward Hardwicke is loveable as kind hearted but bumbling Mr Brownlow, the kind Samaritan who strives to save Oliver despite ever more convincing evidence of the boy's bad choice of company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Filmed in Constable colour scheme of autumn colours, the early part of the film captures some of the beauty of the English countryside and then dashes it to pieces with a gritty polluted vision of Victorian London. Set pieces and costumes feel sincere to the era while the obligatory classical soundtrack completes the requirements for a period drama. The film is well shot and is worthy of compliment. In a story that changes direction and sometimes feels like it is losing its way, the movie keeps the pace moving and the fine performances of the case keep you captivated throughout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering the story's dark undercurrent of child abuse it seems ironic that Roman Polanski (The Pianist), a man reportedly banned from the US for suspected congress with an underage model, should choose to adapt Oliver Twist into a movie. This dark chapter in the director's past, unconfirmed and disturbing that it is, should not taint what is a pleasant movie. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other directors may have taken the movie into a darker seedier slant losing the PG rating and terrifying the audience, while others may have camped things up more akin to the musical. Luckily Polanski picked a path between these two opposites and made a pleasant sincere adaptation of the book that should appeal to a broad spectrum of people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you enjoyed <i>Pride & Prejudice</i>, <i>Vanity Fair</i>, or even if you are a fan of the sixties musical <i>Oliver</i>, you should find this film entertaining.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	204	2011-03-26
205	1	20	\N	Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit	<p>After enormous success on the small screen, Wallace and Gromit are back with a feature length adventure. Wallace, for those who don't know, is a pleasant mild mannered inventor and Gromit is his obedient if put upon pet dog. These two characters get into all manner of scrapes and adventures including robotic trousers used to rob diamonds, a psychotic cyborg sheepdog and the occasional trip to the moon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back 1989 Wallace & Gromit had <I>"A Grand Day Out"</I> when they decided to build a rocket and visit the moon to test out its dairy cuisine. <I>"A Grand Day Out"</I> won a BAFTA and paved the way for the longer and more daring sequel <I>"The Wrong Trousers"</I> in 1993 in which Wallace and Gromit get entangled in an ingenious robbery perpetrated by a sinister penguin. This was further followed by <I>"A Close Shave"</I> in 1995 where the two heroes somehow get entangled with sheep rustling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now after a fairly quiet decade, Wallace & Gromit are back and once again a new danger threatens their idyllic lifestyle. Wallace & Gromit have set themselves up as human pest controllers harmlessly ridding the area of unwanted rabbits. However one moonlit evening an experiment goes wrong and the world will witness the wrath of the wererabbit. Only Wallace and Gromit have the technology to track the beast before it ruins the local vegetable competition hosted by the beautiful Lady Campanula Tottington and her trigger happy suitor Victor Quartermaine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this new feature length adventure Nick Park, the creator of Wallace & Gromit, has once again brought life to the small plastercine characters ordered by millions. Despite widespread fear that the American bank notes that funded the film may tamper with a winning recipe, the film remains true to the spirit and characterisation that was so enjoyable in the three prequels. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peter Sallis (Last of the Summer Wine [TV]) once again offers his fine northern vocals to the loveable if accident prone Wallace while celebrities Ralph Fiennes (Red Dragon) and Helena Bonham Carter(Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) add their vocal talent to create respectively a blundering snobby hunter Victor Quartermaine and a posh but dippy heiress, Lad Campanula Tottington. Despite all these fine voices the main attraction remains silent; Gromit steals the show once again getting more emotion into some simple eye gestures than all the vocals and theatrics put together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a story crammed with comedy and action and a fair few pop culture references, this latest outing for the UK's favourite plastercine heroes (alongside Morph of course) is fantastic. Kids of all ages will love this movie and I strongly recommend it to any loyal fans of Wallace & Gromit.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	205	2011-03-26
206	1	16	\N	Domino	<p>With the unforgettable tagline of 'My name is Domino Harvey and I am a bounty hunter' in a frightfully posh English accent, this film's trailer is sure to have been stuck in movie-goers minds months before its release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Domino is based on the true life story of former model Domino Harvey (Keira Knightley - Pride & Prejudice).  Domino trades in her life of glamour and class to lead the more exciting and thrill-seeking life of a bounty hunter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film begins at its end with Domino being questioned by detective Taryn Miles (Lucy Liu - Kill Bill: Volume 1) about her bounty hunter escapades.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Domino's life is traced back to how she first became interested in becoming a bounty hunter.  On meeting Ed (Mickey Rourke - Sin City) and Choco (Edgar Ramirez) at a bounty hunter seminar, Domino forces them to take her on as a new recruit and to show her the ropes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It turns out that Domino is a natural at bounty hunting.  She uses her good looks, fast punches and expertise with a gun to scare and intimidate her victims into doing what she wants.  She may look like an innocent little flower but his girl can pack a punch!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Domino soon becomes a household name in the world of bounty hunting and even attracts interest from a TV station which wants to follow her and her clan on the road as part of a reality show. When the hunters get dragged into an insurance scam, their lives are put in danger and the TV crew get to film some interesting footage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Knightley is suitably sexy yet sweet as emotionally unstable Domino in her first gritty action role following her dainty comedy action role in <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>. In 'Domino', Knightley gets to spout bad language and attack her own stereotype. Despite having to do semi-nude scenes in the film, Knightly manages to maintain her modesty by using a 'bottom double' for the flesh baring scenes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other notable performances come from Christopher Walken (Man on Fire) as hotshot TV executive Mark Heiss and Delroy Lindo (Get Shorty) as an ambitious bondsman. Also don't miss the comical performances of Beverly Hills 90210 has-beens Ian Ziering and Brian Austin Green (playing themselves) as celebrity hostages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Director Tony Scott keeps true to his directing style in <i>Man on Fire</i> with shaky camera footage and hard hitting violent scenes.  The story is interesting and the acting well performed. Some have criticised the movie for being over stylised and Knightley in particular for her out of place performance. Tosh, the film is entertaining and a well needed change from the run of the mill shoot 'em ups. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watch this film if you liked <i>Man on Fire</i> or <i>Midnight Run</i>.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	206	2011-03-26
207	1	20	\N	The Dukes of Hazzard	<p>Seann William Scott (Welcome to the Jungle) and Johnny Knoxville (Walking Tall) star in the latest comedy remake of a classic TV show, The Dukes of Hazzard. A fun action packed comedy that puts popcorn back on the menu after some recent dubious action flicks.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>In preparation for watching 'The Dukes of Hazzard' I decided to ask around the office to see if anyone had any real recollection of the TV show. I never watched the show as a kid and only had vague memories of a loud orange car jumping ravines and a fat sheriff bumbling around after the Duke brothers and usually falling in a ditch. People in the office could add little more than some thigh slapping and terrible southern accents. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>So with no fixed impression I entered the largest screen of my local multiplex and waited for the film to start. For a Saturday night the screening wasn't that full and I had growing doubts only to be reinforced by an army of clip board toting market researchers handing out feedback forms and non threatening pencils. Happily all concerns were dispelled within minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the TV series didn't have a story, this film is a faithful adaptation. Thankfully a captivating plot isn't really necessary with so much simple comedy and action unfolding on screen. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cousins Luke (Johnny Knoxville) and Bo (Seann William Scott) spend their days dodging the law and delivering illegal moonshine brewed up by their Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson - Wag the Dog). When corrupt local politician and kingpin Boss Hogg (Burt Reynolds - Without a Paddle) and his puppet sheriff Rosco (M.C. Gainey - Con Air) frame Uncle Jesse and seize the family farm, the two lads set out on a quest to expose Hogg's latest plan and save their uncle and the local community. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruising round the state of Georgia driving the famous Orange Dodge Charger, 'General Lee', Bo and Luke Duke have a great time wreaking havoc and stirring up the works. Meanwhile their sexy cousin Daisy (Jessica Simpson - Newlyweds [TV]) tries to save the boys and distract the law with her long legs and luscious figure. Men, such weak and easily lead fools we are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scientific formula for this film is fairly simple. Take a funny couple of lads who aren't afraid to take risks, add in some car chases, some camp villains, a booming rock soundtrack, some more car chases, a sexy lady, a bar room brawl and then another fantastic car chase and you get the perfect recipe for a lad classic. Think 'Smokey and the Bandit' meets 'American Pie'. Great fun and mindless popcorn at its best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnny Knoxville's penchant for physical pain allows him to perform some great stunts while the energetic and idiotic comedy of Seann William Scott completes the duo and cements a great buddy relationship that acts as the basis for the whole film. Many lads and brothers will easily relate to the sadistic and comical side of friendship and the mutual appreciation of Jessica Simpson. The two leads act well off each other and as the blooper shots show in the end credits, it appears the friendship may have some solid basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In support, Burt Reynolds is a little over camp as sinister Boss Hogg while Willie Nelson does little to break the cliche that musicians act like their instruments, mainly wooden. Luckily Jessica Simpson's few lines of dialogue are delivered well and there are some good laughs to be had from oil stained mechanic Cooter (David Koechner - Anchorman) and armadillo wearing conspiracy theorist and ammunitions expert Sheev (Kevin Heffernan - Club Dread).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you enjoy films like Smokey and the Bandit, Cannonball Run, the original TV show or similar car chase franchises like Knight Rider, then this is the flick for you.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	207	2011-03-26
208	1	20	\N	Revolver	<p>Guy Ritchie returns after five years without a big hit movie. The young director of <i>"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"</i> (1998) and <i>"Snatch"</i> (2000) was credited with reinvigorating the British gangster movie and now after five years and a wave of criticism Ritchie returns to the genre that made him famous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason Statham (Snatch, Cellular) stars as Jack Green, a gambler released from prison after seven years who sets off to seek revenge on the man who stitched him up, casino boss Macha (Ray Liotta - Identity). Over seven years inside Jack picked up tips and hints to an ultimate con and now that he is free, he wastes no time in getting started.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Jack sets to work on his prey he learns that fate has played a nasty trick on him. Jack has a rare and incurable blood disease and he will die within days. If that wasn't bad enough his first encounter with Macha did not play out as well as expected and the casino boss has let loose his henchmen to finish Jack off. Luckily two lone sharks, hungry for Jack's money, promise him safety from the henchmen in exchange for the small fortune Jack amassed through his cons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Jack confronts the knowledge of his imminent death he watches the lone sharks slowly manipulate both Macha and a rival gangster, Lord John, into a gang war while they reap the benefits. As the plot unravels Jack starts to question if he is being conned, set up or if he is truly going insane. All the while the various forces around him move toward an all out bloodbath.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the face of it this sounds like the good premise for a movie and the story itself is very intelligent. Sadly the movie is a mess. To add pearls of wisdom to this movie, to help understand the con, different quotes flash up on the screen or are read by the key characters, these quotes are few in number and repeated so often you start to get annoyed. In addition some of the cleverest dialogue seems almost directly lifted from other similar cult gangster films. Add to this some challenging scenes where a characters thoughts are overlaid with the voice of anxiety and the voice of reason and you get the beginnings of a full on headache.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The movie is stylishly shot, but as colleague reminds me, style cannot substitute for talent. The film is disjointed and meandering and although there is the basis of a great story, it is hidden in the general confusion. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jason Statham, as the lead character Jack Green, provided yet another rambling narrative while he wandered through the movie looking either confused or angry. It was a good reflection of the movie itself but not really a memorable performance. As for Ray Liotta as Jack's nemesis, he lacked menace. I'm not sure if this was intentional or not but he spent half the movie looking like a scared puppy and the other half wandering round in his underpants...looking confused or angry. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily Andre Benjamin (Be Cool) as charismatic lone shark Avi and Vincent Pastore (The Sopranos - Salvatore "Big Pussy" Bonpensiero) as his gorilla like partner Zach add a mellow and sometimes comedic support while remaining sufficiently intimidating that they do not fall out of scene. The duo of the stylish rapper turned actor and the huge Italian-American star of Goodfellas, steal the show and they earn the movie a second star.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So was it really as bad as they say, I regret to say yes. I really enjoyed Guy Ritchie's earlier films and had hopes that this could be a great return to form after the abysmal "Swept Away". Unfortunately it was over stylised and too repetitive and after two hours of its wandering dialogue I was tired and disappointed. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you would like to watch this film for yourself and need a comparator, try to imagine the resultant cross bread of <i>"The Usual Suspects"</i> and <i>"Snatch"</i>.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	208	2011-03-26
210	1	15	\N	Lord of War	<p>Lord of War invites you into the murky world of gun running, where the profits are huge but the cost is equally extortionate. Your guide on this journey is Ukrainian American Yuri Orlov (Nicholas Cage - National Treaure), a man who seems willing to risk his life and his liberty selling guns to mercenaries, governments and dictators just to make an easy buck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nicholas Cage is unquestionably a very talented actor and is never better than when he is playing a larger than life character and given some room to strut. However in Lord of War, more than in any of his other recent work, the entire job of carrying the film falls solely to him. Yuri Orlov going about his every day work is enthralling to watch and the scriptwriters have clearly had a ball coming up with inventive and actually quite persuasive ways to justify his profession. Unfortunately such is Orlov's dominance of the film that all the secondary characters are seriously underwritten.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ethan Hawke's (Assault on Precinct 13) Interpol agent doesn't have enough screen time to build into a worthy adversary for Cage's slippery snake and Bridget Moynahan's (I, Robot) role as the trophy wife is also too slight to make her relationship with Yuri at all interesting for the audience. She does little more than smile before Orlov's business activities begin to impact on their home life and even then her reactions upon finding out about his deceit are wholly predictable. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spanning well over a decade in the career of our morally bankrupt antihero, the film simply has too broad a canvas to feel like anything more than a strung together sequence of memorable escapades rather than a coherent plot. The only practical development in the entire film is the more successful Yuri becomes the more of his humanity slips away unnoticed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only episodes that actually hold the audiences' full attention is when Orlov is forced into dealing with lunatic Liberian dictator Andre Baptiste (Eamonn Walker - Tears of the Sun). Walker clearly relishes playing a slightly deranged character and emerges from the film with far more credit than heavy weight co stars such as Ian Holm (Alien).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lord of War frequently switches between the two extremes of being quirkily funny and then savagely shocking the very next moment. It does frequently succeed in raising a guilty laugh, but despite numerous attempts at horrifying the audience it never really succeeds because the world that Yuri Orlov exists in appears to be some larger than life parallel universe. The only time I felt remotely surprised was at the film's end when the credits declared that the storyline was based on actual events. The film is certainly diverting for two hours but just as Yuri hopes at one point that he won't be remembered, neither will the film.</p>\r\n\r\n	3	2011-03-26	210	2011-03-26
211	1	15	\N	Sky High	<p>The first day at school can be intimidating for anyone, but for Will Stronghold it's going to be the most challenging day of his young life. Why? Because he is attending Sky High, a school for teenage super heroes and Will, the son of the world's most celebrated super powered husband and wife team, doesn't have any special abilities of his own.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Not only must Will (Michael Angarano - Lords of Dogtown) struggle with living up to the expectations of a father who refuses to recognise his son's faults, he also has to avoid tangling with a couple of formidable bullies, juggle the attentions of more than one girl and decide whether he really wants to be friends with the 'In-crowd' or the social outcasts he really likes. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Sky High has plenty for kids of a school age to enjoy but there are enough in-jokes and sly references to keep the adults chuckling away too. Kurt Russell (Big Trouble in Little China) makes a welcome return to films after a quiet spell and is clearly having a ball playing larger than life hero The Commander, a super strong legend who isn't exactly perceptive when it comes to his son's problems. At one point he and his wife Jetstream (Kelly Preston - What a Girl Wants) come up with a novel solution to their first born's lack of powers. "We can't change who he is...Not without dropping him in a vat of toxic waste."</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Scene stealing veteran Bruce Campbell (Evil Dead) plays Coach Boomer, the loud mouthed teacher whose job it is to evaluate each pupil's abilities and assign them either hero status or the role of sidekick (also known as hero support). Will, without any powers, ends up in a sidekick class with pupils whose powers include the ability to glow in the dark, turn into a puddle and shape shifting into a purple hamster.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Michael Angarano doesn't exactly grab the audience's attention in the lead role.  He has too much hair and comes across as whiney, but there are plenty of talented young actors on display in this film. The pick of the bunch is Danielle Panabaker (Empire Falls [TV]) who plays Will's best friend Layla, a girl who refuses to conform to the high school tradition of pidgin-holing people into groups. Also very good is Steven Strait as Warren Peace, the son of one of The Commander's greatest enemies, who takes a distinct dislike to Will over some fireworks in the lunch hall.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>This film may seem to be simply Hogwarts for superheroes but this film is a technicolour sugar rush when compared with Harry Potter's gloomy castle settings and labyrinth plotting. These kids' main adversary isn't the threat of some nightmare evil but instead learning to accept people who are different. It may not be as complex as the boy wizard but when the ride is this much fun it doesn't really matter. With a host of talented kids, a bunch of established actors who are game for a laugh and none of Potter's sometimes dreary exposition, Sky High is perhaps the start of a worthy franchise of its own.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	211	2011-03-26
213	1	23	\N	Rag Tale	<p>Cinematic depictions of journalists tend to fall into two categories. Firstly, there is the crusading, idealistic investigator who will stop at nothing to expose wronging, exemplified by <i>All the President's Men</i>, <I>Defence of the Realm</i> or <i>When the Sky Falls</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second is rather less flattering to the humble hack. See <i>Shattered Glass</i> or <i>Fear in Loathing in Las Vegas</i> for the journo as a liar, cheat, booze-hound, drug-hoover and general indulger of vices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The journalists of Rag Tale fall firmly into the second category. They lie, they philander, they pop pills, swill alcohol, ruin careers and take extra-long lunch breaks. Then they get up the next day and do it again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Top of the pile, both in terms of vice-indulgence and status, is Eddy Somerset Taylor (Rupert Graves - Pride [TV]), the editor of Rag Tale's fictional tabloid, The Rag.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eddy's got a problem. He's been having an affair with his female deputy editor M.J (Jennifer Jason Leigh - In The Cut), who also happens to be the chairman Richard Morton's (Malcom McDowell - In Good Company) wife. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The man upstairs is not best pleased that his wife hasn't just been delivering copy to her editor, and a power struggle between the three ensues.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Both Graves and Jason Leigh excel in the two central roles. Rupert Graves' Eddy is the sort of cynical cad you can't help but have a soft spot for, while Jennifer Jason Leigh brings enough heart to her high-heeled career girl to make you care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rest of the cast are all on point, comedian John Sessions (Merchant of Venice) gets all the best lines as the camp anti-royal political editor and Lucy Davis (of Office fame) makes her secretary Debs a Dawn with fangs. Ian Hart (Finding Neverland) also gives a very funny performance as Morph, a Welsh stoner photographer who's renowned for getting creative with images when the right ones don't turn up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much has been made of Rag Tale's epileptic-fit-inducing choppy editing and camera angles, but it succeeds in capturing the intense battle of egos where a more sedate style would fail. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It can make for hard viewing at times, but director Mary McGuckian's use of constant cuts, overlapped dialogue, black-and-white and extreme close-ups convey the breakneck pace of a daily newspaper office. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is one great moment as the film is drawing to its powerful - although ludicrously over the top - conclusion, when the fast edits stop and the camera lingers on a landscape shot of London at night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The almost unwatchable intensity of what has preceded it makes this one shot a quietly poignant moment, given its context in the plot. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mary McGuckian will inevitably get beaten with the 'style over content' stick, but the style of Rag Tale works with its subject matter, rather than superseding it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It doesn't works all the time - sped up shots of people walking to work has been done to death and it could maybe do with more moments of respite - but things move so fast that the bum notes are soon forgotten.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is also true of the script, which was a collaborative effort between McGuckian and the cast. The times when the jokes fall flat are outweighed by the funny bits, and they happen so fast they are soon forgotten.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rag Tale isn't for all tastes, but it rewards the perseverance of those willing to stick with its bold, stylised visuals. It's a bold, dark and funny piece of experimental cinema.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	213	2011-03-26
214	1	15	\N	The Business	<p>Danny Dyer (Is Harry on the Boat?) is messenger boy Frankie, a London kid with big ambitions who is sent to the Spanish coast to deliver a package to larger than life run away robber Charlie (Tamer Hussein - Layer Cake). Charlie takes a shine to the eager kid and Frankie quickly gets swept up in the hedonistic lifestyle of the Costa Del Crime. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>As the newest member of a gang of seriously dodgy geezers Frankie begins to grow into his role as driver and junior villain while also taking a shine to married moll Carly (Georgina Chapman - Bride & Prejudice). I could go into more detail about the plot but to be honest there isn't a lot to say. The gang start to make serious money from drug smuggling and personal rivalries and greed threatens to bring their fun in the sun to an end. The film doesn't exactly revolutionise the gangster genre we have become very familiar with over the last decade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mix Sexy Beast's setting together with Lock Stocks flashy style and add a dash of Layer Cake and director Nick Love (The Football Factory) has managed to create a film that has none of its donors' memorable characters or situations. Instead it just lazily drifts by like a summer afternoon in the garden. The film will find an audience thanks to British cinema's fine pedigree in gangster flicks but most of those who do take a chance on The Business will unlikely be deceived by some swearing and a little gunplay. Nothing interesting, shocking or unexpected actually happens up on screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dyer doesn't have enough to do to confirm whether he has the chirpy talent to make it big beyond the British film industry. By the end of the film, I was beginning to find his blindingly obvious narration so irritating I hoped I would never have to hear his cockney patter ever again. Geoff Bell (Mean Machine) gets to have all the fun as Carly's ginger nutcase husband while Georgina Chapman manages to look stunning despite all the dodgy clothes she's forced to wear.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The eighties setting does raise a nostalgic warmth for the decade but the soundtrack and fashion are merely the trimmings on a skeleton of a movie. The Business doesn't have an original bone in its body.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	214	2011-03-26
215	1	20	\N	The Legend of Zorro	<p>After the sleeper hit <i>'The Mask of Zorro'</i> (1998) and a seven-year snooze in the desert, the caped vigilante has returned. Once again the citizens of California are threatened by a sinister aristocrat with dark designs on their pleasant land and once again the man in black must unravel the truth and thwart a new nemesis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following on from <i>Mask of Zorro</i>, we catch up with Don Alejandro de la Vega (Antonio Banderas - Shrek 2) and his beautiful wife Elena (Catherine Zeta Jones - Ocean's 12), seven years into a marriage on the rocks and with their naughty child Joaquin. Addicted to his Zorro persona, Alejandro spends little time at home and Elena feels abandoned. She files suit and leaves and before long is on the arm of a childhood friend, the mysterious Armand (Rufus Sewell - Extreme Ops). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alone and desperate Alejandro reverts to his pre-Zorro drunken persona. Unable to approach his family and perceived as a coward by his son, Alejandro gives up. After a particularly embarrassing fracas at a party he stumbles into the desert and is nearly killed by a mysterious explosion. As Alejandro investigates, he slowly uncovers the truth behind Armand's visit to California and has to sober up his act if he is to save the people and his family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I could write more on the plot but there is little point. It is well trodden and an amalgam of many other similarly weak action movies poorly grafted together and stuffed with too few actions sequences. Once the story does actually get going it quickly accelerates into the ridiculous and comical. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Antonio Banderas once again steals the show as the sword-wielding Zorro mixing great action with a healthy dash of comedy. Catherine Zeta Jones struggles on with a poor attempt at a Spanish accent but comes off well when compared with the even more pathetic French accent put on by Rufus Sewell trapped in a character from <i>"A Knight's Tale"</i> evidence by how he finds an excuse to joust in nineteenth century America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Legend of Zorro is a childish comedy action flick with little creativity other than in its energetic choreography of the fight scenes and little merit other than some ambitious stunt work. </p>\r\n\r\n	1	2011-03-26	215	2011-03-26
217	1	20	\N	Tristan & Isolde	<p>Loosely based on an Irish myth, Tristan and Isolde tells the tragic love story of an Irish Princess and her lover, an English knight, separated by conflict and loyalty to differing sides of a war. Possibly the inspiration for both Romeo & Juliet, and the mnage a trios of King Arthur, Guinevere and Sir Lancelot, Tristan and Isolde has been discovered and given the big screen treatment.\r\n</p><p>\r\nNoble knight Tristan (James Franco - Spiderman) fights for his Lord Marke (Rufus Sewell - The Legend of\r\nZorro) who hopes to unite the warring tribes of England and overthrow the rule of the evil Irish king Donnchadh (David O'Hara - Hotel Rwanda).\r\n</p><p>\r\nDuring a mission to ambush Irish warriors who have enslaved some innocent peasants, Tristan is wounded and poisoned, to the horror of his allies. Presumed dead, he is sent out to sea to find the afterlife.\r\nHowever, Tristan is not yet dead and his boat washes up, somehow, on the distant Irish shore of his enemy.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMeanwhile in Ireland, the lonely and subjugated daughter of King Donnchadh, Isolde (Sophia Myles -\r\nUnderworld) wanders the beach praying for freedom. As she wanders the sands she spies a boat washed upon shore and finds within it the half dead remnant of Tristan. In secret Isolde nurses Tristan back to health but keeps from him her true identity fearing he may kidnap her and take her to England. When her fearsome father learns there is an Englishman afoot, he sends soldiers to scour the beach and Tristan has to abandon Isolde and flee back to England.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIf the pain of separation wasn't bad enough the couple face even more challenges when, in a nasty trick of fate, Isolde is married off by her father and sent to England as a false token of peace.  As the star-crossed lovers return to England, they fight off the boiling hormones but you know it's all going to end badly. With enemies hoping to split the newly united England, and the Irish army just off shore, can Tristan keep his manhood under control to avoid disaster? Does a tragic tale have a happy ending?\r\n</p><p>\r\nWe all knew where the plot was going when we sat down, the journey is what matters. With the Scott brothers, Tony (Man on Fire) and Ridley (Kingdom of Heaven), producing the movie you know they will find the best ingredients. Director Kevin Reynolds (The Count of Monte Cristo) is a veteran at period movies and he manages to create a strong element of realism in all of the sets and costumes and fills the movie running time with a strong story. The one weakness, and sadly it is quite a big weakness, is the acting.\r\n</p><p>\r\nJames Franco is handsome and well built so the numerous early scenes of his injured frame recovering in a beach hut will delight the female audience. Sadly, in a role that requires the full spectra of emotion, Franco spends most of the movie silently sulking and moping around forests. By contrast, Sophia Myles beams as she projects well her loneliness, loss, love and suffering. Sadly it takes two to tango and in a movie where the central plot focuses on two lovers, she cannot carry the show.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn support Rufus Sewell is impressive as Lord Marke and manages to project a person of high importance that marries well (pardon the pun) with his role of the tragic new King of England while Bronagh Gallagher (Thunderpants) offers gentle Irish comfort as Isolde's long suffering and protective maid.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn summary this is a very beautiful and well-made movie that should delight fans of the historic romances such as Romeo & Juliet, Pride & Prejudice or Robin Hood. The sets, the action and the costumes are as expected from a Scott Free production but the lack of chemistry between the lovers robbed the movie of greatness.</p>	3	2011-03-26	217	2011-03-26
200	1	15	Blah	Land of the Dead	<p>Do you often find yourself wandering the streets late at night in search of sustenance? Are you having trouble forming complete sentences and instead often only grunt and gurgle? Does it sometimes feel like someone's ripped open your skull and begun to slurp up your delicious brains? Well if the answer is yes and you are looking for an easy way to spend an evening then there is no need to worry as the perfect film for you has arrived!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No brains of any sort are necessary while watching Land of the Dead, the fourth instalment in George A. Romero's legendary Living Dead series. Dispensing with irritating and time consuming characterisation Romero has constructed a disaster of violence that jettisons both the comedy and the frights of previous entries into the series.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Land of the Dead focuses on the surviving citizens of a protected city controlled by a corrupt millionaire (Dennis Hopper-Easy Rider). The rich live in the splendour of a skyscraper while the poor struggle in the squalor of the streets below. Hired guns in custom built vehicles forage for food in the surrounding towns while the zombies that inhabit the rest of the Earth slowly evolve into intelligent beings.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The plotting is a mess and lacks any real momentum, which is odd considering it is essentially about a bleeding horde of the undead closing in on one of mankind's last strongholds. The slow approach of the dead should have been an easy way to crank up the tension but instead the limping masses are abandoned for long periods so that we can instead witness the mercenaries, who supposedly protect the city, switch sides and constantly double cross each other. This back stabbing gets quickly repetitive and I had little idea who was working for who at any one time or what exactly all the running about was meant to achieve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dennis Hopper injects as much conviction into his scenes as he has done in every film he has made in the last thirty years. Simon Baker (The Ring 2) who plays hero Riley, is a charisma vacuum of an actor while Asia Argento (xXx) spends the entire film talking as if her jaw has been wired shut. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>On almost every count Land of the Dead just can't compare with its modern opposition. <I>Shaun of the Dead</I> exposed Romero's stumbling zombies as the least threatening monsters in movie history while films such as <I>28 Days Later</I> and even the remake of Romero's own <I>Dawn of the Dead</I> have injected the genre with a pace and frenzy that the old master simply can't match. Much like one of Romero's zombies, this film shouldn't be too hard to avoid.</p>\r\n	1	2011-03-26	200	2012-03-08
187	1	20	Blah	The Longest Yard	<p>The former American football hero, Paul "Wrecking" Crewe (Adam Sandler - Spanglish), hits the bottle after allegations of point fixing cause an embarrassing end to his career. After a drunken police chase and multiple pile up, the football legend is charged for drink driving and sentenced to three years in a Texan penitentiary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the blazing sun and barren wastes of the Texas wilderness there stands a lonely dilapidated prison. It is a gateway to hell full of the worst dregs of the underworld and the most corrupt guards in the service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It doesn't take Paul long to learn the chief of the guards, Captain Knauer (William Fichtner - Crash) is a vicious sadist and that as a corrupt sports star in a football crazy state, his stay in hell will be very long and painful. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help add to his troubles, the ambitious Warden Hazen (James Cromwell - I, Robot) has dreams of seeing his prison guard football team winning the league and helping boost his political career. To help his team improve, the warden seeks Paul's advice in exchange for a softer stay. When Paul inspires the warden to arrange a pre-league match to help the guards practice their skills, Paul finds himself charged with training a gang of convicts for a big showdown. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>After short bout of territorial piss fighting with inmates and guards, Paul's credibility slowly starts to rise and it doesn't take long for the local fixer, the caretaker (Chris Rock - Madagascar) to befriend Paul and give him the strength to battle on and form a football team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a prison full of all shapes and sizes, it doesn't take long for Paul to find a few guys willing to face off against the guards. However with a few racial tensions and some exotic lady-boy cheerleaders, Paul won't find it easy to mould the miscreants into a fighting team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What follows is the standard comic story of a bunch of unfit ill disciplined yobs slowly moulding into a team worthy to confront their attackers. The clich individual battles between team mates and their personal goals are explored via an array of minor characters while the central players keep central plot moving along. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remake of the 1974 Burt Reynolds movie of the same name, The Longest Yard had all the tell tale signs of clich sports movie mixed in with the standard remake format. Luckily director Peter Segal (50 First Dates) knows how to draw comedy from an otherwise well trodden story and happily this movie manages to rise above expectation. Mixing sports humour with prison humour and adding in the odd smidge of human drama, this is a worthy remake of a lesser known seventies hit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chris Rock and Adam Sandler fuse well as the comedy double act leading the show while Burt Reynolds (Dukes of Hazzard) adds hammy gravitas as the grizzled coach  showing the young punks how the game "should" be played.  In support Nelly makes an impressive leap to the big screen in more ways than one and manages to put in a good stab at acting along with the occasional Reebok advert. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rating this film isn't easy, it's definitely better than what I expected (two stars) but doesn't deserve a fourth star (an award for greatness); three stars it is. Better than "Bewitched" but not as funny as "The Forty Year Old Virgin", the other two all star comedies currently screening. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you're a fan of Adam Sandler comedies such as Anger Management or sports movies like Coach Carter or maybe even a blend of the two...er...Dodgeball...then you'll be entertained by this flick.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	187	2012-03-08
201	1	20	It's beautiful to look at but you're better off reading the original book	Howl's Moving Castle	<p>Visionary director Hayao Miyazaki (Spirited Away 2001) returns with yet another fantastic story full of magic and romance. Based on the novel by British writer Diana Wynne-Jones, Hauru no ugoku shiro (aka "Howl's Moving Castle"), the story follows a young girl swept into the world of magic set against a backdrop of war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sophie is a young girl who spends her days running her late father's hat shop. While the other girls go out to have fun, Sophie tends to the shop. While other girls fear the roaming wizard Howl, who eats the hearts of beautiful young girls, Sophie is more concerned with her hats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One day while walking through back alleys to visit her sister, Sophie is cornered by two sleazy soldiers but is saved by the mysterious Howl. As Howl and Sophie try to return to the main thoroughfare they are set upon by shape shifting demons summoned by the sinister witch of the waste, one of Howl's enemies. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a magical escape into the skies, Howl sets Sophie down on a balcony before fleeing back into the crowd. Unfortunately the envious witch of the waste seeks a little revenge against Sophie and so she places a curse on her that transforms her into an elderly lady. The curse will not allow her to tell anyone what has happened and leaves Sophie frail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fearing alienation from her family and friends, Sophie sets off into the Waste to find either the witch who cursed her or the wizard Howl who may save her. In the wild she meets a friendly scarecrow who guides her to Howl's amazing moving castle. Inside the castle she finds a fire demon, a small boy and a lot of mess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sophie soon establishes herself as the cleaner and brings a little order to the bachelor pad on legs. Fire demon Calcifer, who powers the house, is bound to Howl and is trapped in servitude. Calcifer can see the curse upon Sophie but cannot help her unless he is freed, and so the two new friends hope to help each other while, as expected, Sophie's feelings for Howl grow slowly into love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Howl is oblivious to most of this, however, as he is himself torn between two warring states who each seek the help of witches and wizards. Unfortunately though, Howl is powerful and gifted.  He is self-centered and vain. How can Howl be so egocentric? Why does the witch of the waste pursue him, and how can Sophie free herself of her curse?  These are but a few questions the heroine must answer in this imaginative fantasy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with his earlier films, Hayao Miyazaki demonstrates that not only has he a flair for imaginative scenery and set pieces, he can also construct clever multilayered stories that connect with a wide audience. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Howl's Moving Castle, similar to its predecessor <i>"Spirited Away"</i>, has a fair number of metaphors and subplots that add a level of complexity rarely seen in mainstream western animation. This complexity adds to the merit of the movie but can be lost on younger children and, as these films are quite long, they may also lose the attention of their target audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the English translation of the classic, Christian Bale (Batman Begins) adds the confident voice of Howl while Emily Mortimer (Dear Frankie) and Jean Simmons (How to Make an American Quilt) bring life to young and old Sophie respectively. Adding comedy Billy Crystal (Analyze That) has some of the best quips as down trodden Calcifer while the husky voice of Lauren Bacall (Dogville) adds a seductive, yet malicious, tinge to the wicked witch of the waste.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Howl's Moving Castle is visually sumptuous and has many great themes. It may be a little long but that doesn't detract from the overall effect. If you're a fan of <i>'Spirited Away'</i> you should love this flick.</p>	3	2011-03-26	201	2012-03-13
34	1	15	\N	Its All Gone Pete Tong	<p>Frankie Wilde is an Ibiza legend. A DJ at the top of his game with a trophy wife, a rampant coke habit and just one little problem, he's going deaf.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's All Gone Pete Tong is a film with an interesting premise, if a little on the familiar side. Plenty of films have been made about successful, if arrogant, men at the top of their particular tree who manage to lose everything only to gain a little humility when they have nothing. Usually these characters are ruthless businessmen who learn the error of their ways but with this film it is a self absorbed club DJ whose fall from grace is long and rather funnily done as well.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Paul Kaye (Blackball) plays to his strengths in the lead role - loud, irritating and generally unpleasant. He is a man with little understanding about what his impending deafness will mean and with apparently little reserves of character to bounce back from his disability.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Once the full implications of his hearing loss set in, the comedy subsides and Frankie barricades himself within his mansion and goes through the plodding cycle of hysteria, self pity and despondency. If the film makers wanted the audience to feel sorry for Frankie they have seriously misjudged this middle section of the film. The self absorbed drunken junkie antics might have been amusing as the bewildered DJ spirals towards destruction but upon crash landing I had no wish to spend an extended stay in the gutter with the unpleasant man.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Stick with the film through this interval though and you will be rewarded. Frankie comes up from the depths of despair and surprisingly the film becomes a feel good movie that is, at times, genuinely touching. Frankie may still be a boorish lout but Kaye proves that as an actor he does have range imbuing his now completely deaf DJ with a touch of depth which finally allows the audience to root for his character.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The film certainly has its problems. There is too much swearing and the faux documentary style that frequently interrupts the narrative is distracting and usually pointless, but it has strong performances by Kaye and Beatriz Batarda, who plays his lip reading instructor, and a decent amount of laughs in what amounts to a decent little film.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	34	2011-03-26

218	1	15	\N	Doom	<p>Never before have I witnessed a louder cheer in a cinema for the introduction of a prop. The film in question was game-to-film adaptation Doom, and the prop in question was the so called BFG. Apparently this officially stands for Bio-Force Gun but that wasn't how either the noisy audience or the characters on screen referred to it. I must admit that it looked like an impressive piece of hardware and the prop department should be congratulated but was it really worth a cheer? I suppose there is precious little else to be happy about while watching the movie. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>The most disappointing thing about Doom is what I perceived to be a lack of effort and imagination across the entire production. A film based on a computer game was never going to be a bastion of originality but everything from the script to the threadbare characterisation is bland and derivative. Certainly the basic plot elements have close similarities to James Cameron's Aliens. In both cases contact is lost with the population of an off world instillation and a team of rag tag soldiers are sent to investigate the situation. A host of toothy monsters are responsible and lots of shouting and shooting quickly follows. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>While I have no problems with film makers borrowing ideas from other films, I can't help but object when these ideas are rehashed without any of the creativity that made the originals classics. Aliens was claustrophobically shot and eerily lit, techniques that rapidly built tension. It took Doom nearly a full hour before I became even slightly caught up in the plot. During that time all I seemed to have been subjected to was scene after scene of gun wielding mannequins stalking down identikit corridors. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>The squad of marines certainly aren't interesting or entertaining enough to carry the first half of the movie before the serious shooting starts. Some are lucky enough to have their own individual trait, such as sleazy soldier or religious chap, but what none of them have are lines that are witty or surprising. Only Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson (Be Cool) emerges with any credit having made the wise choice of opting to take the role of Sarge rather than the lead character of John Grimm. Saddled with that particular task is Karl Urban who did a nice job as the cold efficient killer in The Bourne Supremacy but is anonymous in this role. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Much has been made of the first person shoot-um-up scene in which the audience views the monster-filled corridors from Grimm's perspective. The effect is briefly entertaining but is quickly spoiled by the blearing soundtrack, some silliness involving a Zombie with an axe and finally an overwhelming feeling of motion sickness as the camera wildly topples about during a tussle with a mutant pig. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Why, you might wonder, is there a mutant pig on Mars anyway? Well since you asked, the plot concerns a group of scientists experimenting on themselves with alien DNA. One of the unfortunate side effects of this procedure is that the recipients turn into snarling creatures who only really turn up on very dark sets or when someone has switched on the strobe lighting. Surviving scientist Rosamund Pike (Pride and Prejudice) occasionally tries to explain what is going on but at one stage a character rips off his own ear presumably so he won't have to listen anymore to her attempts at an American accent.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Teenage boys who like their guns big and their blood splattered will probably love Doom. Certainly there are a lot of films out there that are worse but I was hoping for a little more from this particular action flick than The Rock glaring at people and one shiny prop.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	218	2011-03-26
220	1	15	\N	The Brothers Grimm	<p>Something rotten is going on in the forests of Germany. Young girls are disappearing into the dark forests that surround the village of Marbaden. The superstitious villagers point to an evil force that is said to live in an abandoned ruin in the woods while Napoleon's French army, who occupy the surrounding land, think a human hand is responsible. The Brothers Grimm, Will and Jake, a recently arrested pair of con artists who specialise in fooling gullible locals into believing that monsters reside round every corner, are dispatched by the French to solve the mystery. If man-made tricks are being used to scare the populace no-one else is more qualified to prove that there is a rational explanation and unmask the real culprit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bumbling duo arrive at the village under the watchful glare of escorting soldiers led by Italian idiot Cavaldi (Peter Stormare - Constantine) and are met by hostile and despondent locals. After a perilous trip into the forest the Brothers realise that the rationale French may in fact be wrong and that dark magic really is behind the disappearances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No single problem can be pointed to as the root cause of everything that is wrong with The Brothers Grimm but let me assure you that there are plenty of things wrong. Among some of the movie's most obvious failings are special effects that are plain shoddy in places and in others, such as the computer generated Gingerbread man, utterly abysmal. In terms of performances, Peter Stormare's supposedly comic turn as pantomime villain Cavaldi is truly diabolical while special recognition should go to Jonathan Pryce (De-Lovely) for his own unique 'interpretation' of the French accent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the supporting characters are bad, the leads are just plain bland. Absolutely no attempt at characterisation is made for the entire first hour of the film. The two heroes stumble between situations and confrontations with the audience learning practically nothing about their relationship beyond the blindingly obvious. It is only after the introduction of local girl Angelika (Lena Headey - The Cave) as a potential love interest for both of the Brothers do the pair begin to generate some chemistry with both her and each other. Heath Ledger (Lords of Dogtown) produces the better performance of the pair as Jake Grimm, the reticent dreamer of the duo. Matt Damon (The Bourne Supremacy) fairs less well as Will Grimm, the sceptical and practical mercenary of the team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Brothers Grimm is clearly superior to director Terry Gilliam's last cinematic effort, The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, but since that film didn't even make it beyond a few days worth of filming before falling apart, Grimm doesn't exactly have the toughest of opposition to compete against. Just as when working on Don Quixote, the director experienced plenty of interference from the studio on this project. It is impossible to know how The Brothers Grimm would have turned out if Gilliam had been allowed to follow his own vision but what the audience have been left with is a grating, slog of a movie that wastes a decent idea by burying it under a mound of mediocrity.</p>\r\n	1	2011-03-26	220	2011-03-26

Her hopes of crawling into a corner and hiding away for the rest of her life have been dashed by her family's matchmaking plans.  Even her widowed father (Christopher Plummer - Alexander) has thrown himself back into dating with a trio of girlfriends on the go.  Maybe not the best example to follow!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her sisters, Carol (Elizabeth Perkins - The Ring Two) and Christine (Ali Hillis - Kiss Kiss Bang Bang), are especially keen for Sarah to get back into the dating game.  Telephone numbers and photographs of men are being hurled at Sarah left, right and centre.  Shame she isn't interested in any of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carol soon resorts to full on meddling and posts Sarah's lonely hearts ad on the internet for all to see.  Before Sarah even knows what is going on, she has more than a dozen voice messages from potential suitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with most date movies, you get the usual handful of no-good layabouts, emotional wrecks and downright sleazes.  For Sarah, it is no different. But one guy sticks in her mind.  As her advert says 'must love dogs', along comes mutt-friendly, boat carving Jake (John Cusack - Runaway Jury).  But Jake is memorable for all the wrong reasons, mainly his great talent for accidentally insulting Sarah and coming across as a psycho.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Disheartened by the whole dating scene, Sarah sets her sights on her own target, Bob (Dermot Mulroney - The Wedding Date), the separated father of one of her students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite all her reservations about dating a student's father, Sarah and Bob start to develop feelings for each other.  Jake is still on the scene and determined to have a second shot with Sarah to prove himself as a worthy suitor.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who will succeed in winning Sarah's affections?  Will it be the smoldering and smooth-talking father or the slightly unstable and neurotic boat carver?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diane Lane is a delight as sweet and loveable Sarah.  She delivers some heartfelt and poignant lines and gives a warm performance as the lonely divorcee.  Cusack spices up the romance with his old-ball character and adds some good comedy while Mulroney plays his usual dashing self.  Perkins also adds to the humour as meddling sister, Carol and Plummer gives a good performance as Sarah's serial dating father who gets to deliver some of the most touching lines in the whole show. In fact the entire family provides a convincing portrayal of a close and loving household.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Must Love Dogs is a great romantic comedy with some superb acting and a well-chosen cast.  Fans of matchmaking movies such as The Perfect Man and Sleepless in Seattle will enjoy this movie.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	221	2011-03-26
222	1	15	\N	Goal - The Movie	<p>Considering the previous form of sports films centred on football of the spherical variety it takes a certain amount of confidence in your story to announce a hat trick of films before the first movie even hits cinema screens. On the strength of Goal, the first outing in this proposed trilogy, it may well be worth turning up to see parts two and three.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film follows the path to glory of Santiago Munez (Kuno Becker), a poor Mexican teenager living in inner city Los Angeles. He has few prospects of escaping a life of hard grind and low wages. He spends all day cleaning rich people's gardens under the gaze of his strict father and working all night in a Chinese restaurant's kitchen. Munez, however, does have talent with a football and although he only plays with an amateur team in a dusty park he still catches the eye of ex professional Glen Foy (Stephen Dillain - King Arthur).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Munez decides to follow his dream rather than his father's advice and heads halfway round the world to try and make it as a professional in the mud and rain of Newcastle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kuno Becker only has slightly more charisma than your average footballer, but his character is interesting enough that you can't help but root for him throughout. Anna Friel (Timeline) is good as club nurse and potential love interest Roz but most impressive is Marcel Iures (Hart's War) as Newcastle United's German manager, a performance so convincing I can imagine him stalking the touch line every week during Match of the Day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film does suffer for not building towards a memorable climax. Munez has so many setbacks en route to the end, it comes as an enormous relief when he finally achieves success. Each pitfall in Munez's journey arrives and is resolved in turn before the next problem raises its head. This gives the film a slightly repetitive quality as our young hero must first deal with the mud and rain of England, then his health problems, then the dangers of celebrity. By the time a final trauma presents itself there appears to be little doubt that Munez will respond just as he did for the dozen or so earlier issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film's real strength, however, is its sense of humour. The decision to pick Newcastle as the film's central location and United as the focus of attention means that a goldmine of Geordie humour can be exploited. Of particular amusement is the constant abuse southern mercenary Gavin Harris (Alessandro Nivola) gets from local fans for his ineffective performances on the pitch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Goal benefits from low expectations and the absolute conviction of everyone involved but it will have to come up with a few new tricks if it is to maintain audience attention for Santiago's journey all the way to Real Madrid and the World Cup beyond.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	222	2011-03-26
223	1	20	\N	Nanny McPhee	<p>Acclaimed actress and screenwriter Emma Thompson presents an adaptation of the Nurse Matilda stories by Christianna Brand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cedric (Colin Firth - Love Actually) is a young widow struggling to cope with his seven adorable but undisciplined children. Working as an undertaker, Cedric's salary is barely enough to support the family and he is therefore reliant on an allowance provided by formidable Aunt Adelaide (Angela Lansbury).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doubtful of Cedric's ability to raise the children, Aunt Adelaide stipulates that Cedric must find a bride within a month or she will stop the family allowance. Without the allowance poor Cedric will be sent to debtor's prison and the children will be sent to the workhouse. Not wanting to worry the children, Cedric tries to find a new wife. The children, unaware of the family's troubles, think he is trying to find them a new step-mother and as all children know, there are no nice step-mothers. Well, not in fairytales anyway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cedric is at his wits end and the children feel he no longer loves them so they scare away every nanny he hires to care for them while he tries to find a bride. After seventeen nannies leave in despair, the agency for nannies refuses to help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That evening, while Cedric tries to think of a solution, there is a knock at the door. There, on the doorstep, is the ugliest nanny you have ever seen, Nanny McPhee (Emma Thompson - Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban). While Cedric has a most uncomfortable conversation with Nanny McPhee, the children decide that now is the time to have some fun in the kitchen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As culinary pandemonium ensues, Nanny McPhee steps into the fray. The children, excited at the challenge of scaring away a new nanny, decide to be even naughtier. The naughtier they are, the calmer is Nanny McPhee, then the children realise that by some form of magic Nanny McPhee is making them even naughtier. As events spiral toward disaster they realise they must ask politely for Nanny McPhee to stop the magic. This is the beginning of a series of magical events that will change the children's lives forever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Closely akin to <i>'Bedknobs and Broomsticks'</i>, Nanny McPhee is a fun film full of magic and comedy that should delight younger children who may be too young for the Harry Potter movies. The story has some good morals without becoming a sermon and has not only a touch of sadness but also a lovely little romance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emma Thompson is enigmatic and mysterious as formidable but kind Nanny McPhee and Colin Firth is hilarious as bumbling father, Cedric. In support Imelda Staunton (Vera Drake) shows her lighter side as the militant cook who falls victim to the children's capers and Kelly MacDonald (Finding Neverland) shines as the beautiful, if shy maid, Evangeline. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering the current obsession with magic following the success of Harry Potter and the fantasy Lord of the Rings, Nanny McPhee, by comparison, is a very light comedy aimed at younger children. The magic is simple rather than frightening and the comedy is slapstick rather than sarcastic. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would recommend this film to children between five and twelve who may only recently have started visiting the cinema and may be too young for Harry Potter. Recommended for kids who liked <i>'Shrek'</i> or <i>'Madagascar'</i>.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	223	2011-03-26
224	1	20	\N	Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire	<p>In his three years at Hogwarts school for witchcraft and wizardry, Harry has successfully thwarted two attempts by a dark lord to return to power, freed a man wrong imprisoned for murder and exposed a traitor who has lain hidden for thirteen years. He has battled trolls, giant spiders and a hundred foot long killer snake that can kill you at a glance. He has done all of this and he is only fourteen. Bit of a frightening and exciting lifestyle for a little boy from Surrey raised by an unloving aunt and her moody family. Traumatic as this all sounds, things are destined to be almost as thrilling for Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During an exciting visit to the Quidditch World Cup, Harry and his loyal friends Ron and Hermione witness a vicious attack by a gang of death eaters, dark wizards loyal to the fallen dark lord. At night Harry's dreams are haunted by images of the weakened dark lord plotting another attempt at resurrection and in those dreams Harry hears his name tied to the success of the dark lord. Someone is coming for Harry and he doesn't know who.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the usual exciting return to Hogwarts, the one place where Harry really feels at home, new challenges befall him. An ancient competition, The Triwizard Tournament, is being held. The tournament picks one student from each of three magical schools to compete in three deadly challenges. As the three names are spat out by the mystical Goblet of Fire but something unexpected happens, a fourth name is read, Harry's name. The magical laws surrounding the contest mean that Harry cannot back out, he is forced to compete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His fellow students label Harry a cheat, they believe he has nobbled the Goblet so he could compete and earn even more fame. Even his closest friend, Ron, doubts Harry's sincerity and their friendship collapses. While Harry faces the tournament alone and unaided, the chain of coincidence can mean only one thing, someone behind the scenes is plotting against him but who is it? The school has so many guests, there is the dodgy headmaster of a Bulgarian School, a nosey reporter, a paranoid political minister and a frightening new teacher, Mad Eye Moody.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fourth book in the Harry Potter franchise is larger than its predecessors and many doubted that the story's various subplots could be encapsulated in a single movie. As it is, British director Mike Newell (Four Weddings & a Funeral) has had to cut many of the book's less important threads to trim the movie down to its lengthy two hours thirty seven minutes. For fans who may not have read the books, the film is great and ties in well with its predecessors.  However, the book readers may be a little annoyed at some of the cuts. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Quidditch World Cup feels a little rushed but the Triwizard tournament is brought to the screen brilliantly and the dragon fight will be a highlight for many. The dark back plot that comes to the front towards the last quarter of the movie makes for a great climactic end, which might scare some of the younger viewers and probably explains the 12A certificate. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall HP4 is a further step towards maturity when compared with the earlier films and, as such, the story is more complex. The characters are becoming less one dimensional and the back story, once just there to set a stage, is becoming more crucial. The relationships between Harry and his friends are becoming more engaging, even if the acting is still a tad wooden and Harry's developing fondness for the girls adds an element of humour as well as reality. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>My quibbles with this movie are that the film sometimes feels a little rushed and, although I think it is great, I think there could have been a little more development of the Cedric character and a little more mystery at the end of the film. Fans who have read the fifth book will know that a majority of that story concerns the suspicions of people and the disbelief of what is really going on. I'm not the director but I think that this feature of the fifth story really needs to be cemented in the fourth movie as it was in the book. Anyway, enough of my HP fan geek complaints, onward!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All three child actors, Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione), have improved greatly. Radcliffe's hairstyle is going a little Frodo Baggins at the moment but he remains HP with the all important scar and troubled expression. Grint is better than before but still a little clunky while Watson seems to surpass the others and is becoming a little bit of a starlet. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to a few friends from the previous films we also get to meet a few new students in this movie including the other Triwizard competitors, Cedric, Fleur and Victor, as well as a new love interest for Harry, Cho. Unfortunately none of these new players get enough screen time to make any real impression; a real shame as one character in particular, Cedric Diggory, (Robert Pattinson - Vanity Fair) has potentially one of the most emotional scenes in the book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The older cast include the HP alumni of Michael Gambon (Layer Cake) as wise headmaster Dumbledore, Maggie Smith (Ladies in Lavender) as strict professor McGonagall, Robbie Coltrane (HP3) as huge hairy Hagrid and Alan Rickman (Love Actually) as dark and suspicious Professor Snape. Each remains fantastic and add familiarity and continuity while we get to meet further cast additions such as Brendan Gleeson (Troy) as a fearsome new teacher who scares and inspires, Miranda Richardson (Phantom of the Opera) as a 'creative with the truth' gossip journalist and David Tennant (Casanova [TV]) as a new enemy haunting Harry's dreams and Dumbledore's past. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a huge movie in every sense of the word. The fan-base of both children and adults is global, the cast list is excellent and endless, the scope of the story is magical and beyond any of the previous movies in the franchise and the appeal is wider than ever thanks to a mature story with the grasp of younger kids and more interesting to older audiences. The story has humour and horror, thrills and spills and will keep you gripped from beginning to end.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	224	2011-03-26
226	1	12	\N	Kiss Kiss Bang Bang	<p>Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey Jnr - Gothika) is a petty crook who finds himself being wined and dined in LA after blundering into a screen-test while evading the police and then winning the lead part. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a lavish party he bumps into his childhood sweetheart, Harmony (Michelle Monaghan - The Bourne Supremacy), and is introduced to Gay Perry (Val Kilmer - Alexander), a private eye whom he will shadow in order to prepare for his film role as a detective. Perry takes Harry with him on a routine surveillance job that goes wrong when they witness a murder for which Harry is subsequently framed. In the meantime Harry pretends to be a real private eye in order to help out, and thus stay close to, Harmony, and as the corpses begin to pile he gradually works out that the two cases are linked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The name Shane Black won't ring many bells, but the films he has written should do. Responsible for the first two <i>"Lethal Weapon"</i> films, along with <i>The Last Boy Scout</i> and <i>The Long Kiss Goodnight</i>, Black kicked off the trend for buddy-cop films in late-80s and early 90s, made a large amount of money, and then disappeared. For ten years. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang marks both his return as a writer and his debut as a director, and what a comeback it is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It seems only fitting that the man who got the genre started should be the one to reinvigorate it. Dark, witty, subversive, and gloriously self-referential, the film delights in tramping over a multitude of genre cliches while telling a genuinely entertaining story. The introduction narrated by Harry sets the scene appropriately, explaining in brief anecdotes how each of the key characters reached the party, he comes to a complete half as he realises that he's left out an anecdote that he mentioned earlier, and so literally rewinds the film to the appropriate point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harry is the nominal hero, yet he is an idiot, prone to over-emotion, and spends a lot of time getting the crap kicked out of him. Perry is the gay sidekick, except he's tougher, more intelligent and very capable. Harmony is intelligent and interesting simply because she is so much more real than other similar female roles in the genre. Neither the typical helpless damsel in distress nor some kind of superwoman, her character is complex and flawed as one might expect of someone whose dreams of fame had been so thoroughly crushed by Hollywood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chemistry between Downey and Kilmer is excellent, and the two regularly trade scathing retorts, though it's usually Gay putting down Harry for saying or doing another stupid thing. The potential for a sequel is there, and this is a film that should exploit the chemistry between its two leads further, though hopefully not to the extent of the aforementioned Lethal Weapon series.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I keep saying 'genre' but that's not entirely accurate since the film mixes up a number of genres, including relationship comedy, hardboiled noir and action. It's hard to put a finger on exactly what makes it so good, other than by breaking the film down to individual moments. The way Gay Perry continuously puts down Harry with a single line, the slapstick comedy involving Harry's dismembered fingers, or the increasingly absurd action finale which climaxes with Harry dangling above a freeway clutching the hand of a corpse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I could deconstruct the film down to an even greater level of detail, but to be honest you're better off finding out for yourself everything that makes this film so great. For sheer entertainment Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is going to be hard to beat, so do yourself a favour and go and watch one the best films released this year.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	226	2011-03-26
228	1	20	\N	The Constant Gardener	<p>Ralph Fiennes stars as Justin Quayle, a mild mannered British diplomat who learns that his wife Tessa, a human rights campaigner, has been murdered while carrying out research in the wilds of Kenya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the reserved diplomat tries to recover from the shock of his wife's murder and suggested infidelity, he stumbles upon a private letter that casts doubts over the current motive for her death. As Justin investigates his wife's work in Africa he recalls their happy past and their recent problems and in these recollections finds the snippets to help him unravel the growing mystery of her death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on the popular novel from John Le Carre (Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy), The Constant Gardener is a multilayered complex thriller that packs a real punch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ralph Fiennes is simply brilliant as the quiet but relentless diplomat who pursues the truth no matter how painful the path may be. In a role that requires a great breadth of emotion and intensity, Fiennes demonstrates once again his great ability to embody his character. So natural is Fiennes' performance of this mild diplomat that you can no longer imagine him as the troubled maniac from Red Dragon, the sleazy porn peddler from Strange Days or the cold concentration camp warden in Schindler's List. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also worthy of praise, Rachel Weisz (Constantine) takes a step away from her usual mainstream popcorn career to remind us that she is a great actress. As Tessa Quayle, Weisz appears in a variety of flashbacks and gets the chance to play with the audience's preconceived stereotypes to such a degree that her character remains mysterious and enduring long after the film is finished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An award of five stars rightly suggests this film is a cut above the rest. Acclaimed director Fernando Meirelles (City of God) has expertly presented this story in such a way that it plays upon your pre-conceptions and ideas. A simple comment in one scene will make you form an opinion on a particular character only to slap you in the face five minutes later by showing you a new perspective exposing your own misunderstanding of that half heard comment. These tricks and revelations keep the story moving at a slowly accelerating pace until you are caught up in the mystery and the escalating importance of each new scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to subtle dialogue and character development, Meirelles employs a stark photographic style to add intensity to the movie. Marrying bleached visuals of shanty towns and squalor with the lush verdant green of a golf course, or the violent turmoil of a bandit raid with the serene panorama from an aeroplane window, this film is as artistic as it is thought provoking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Murder, suspicion, paranoia, adultery, conspiracy and manipulation appear repeatedly in this movie but the most frightening and applicable adjective for this film is plausibility. With such a complex plot I cannot describe the story without giving something away but needless to say the horror suggested on screen is made more potent by the knowledge that similar events are almost certainly occurring at this very moment. That last thought is what sticks in my mind and with everything else makes this the most impressive film I have seen this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys films such as <i>'Traffic'</i>, <i>'The Insider'</i>, <i>'All the President's Men'</i> or <i>'City of God'</i>.</p>\r\n	5	2011-03-26	228	2011-03-26
231	1	16	\N	Firewall	<p>Jack Stanfield (Harrison Ford - Hollywood Homicide) is a security specialist for Landrock Pacific Bank.  His company is in the midst of a merger but after years of working in a specific environment Jack is resistant to any sign of change.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOutside of work, Jack is a family man and he lives with his loving wife Beth (Virginia Madsen - Sideways) and kids Sarah (Carly Schroeder - Mean Creek) and Andy (Jimmy Bennett - The Amityville Horror).\r\n</p><p>\r\nAs the film starts we watch Jack head off to work on what he thinks is a normal day.  Everything runs smoothly except for an unexpected visit from a debt collector and a case of mistaken identity, a hint that things are about to go pear shaped.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter work Jack joins his friend Arlin for a brief meeting with a hot shot banker, Cox (Paul Bettany - Wimbledon), who has a job proposal. Uninterested Jack makes his excuses and hops into his car ready for a family evening when Cox unexpectedly climbs into Jack's car and reveals his true interest in him.\r\n</p><p>\r\nCox isn't a banker at all but a crook who has taken Jack's family hostage in order to take control of him. Cox wants Jack to infiltrate the bank's security system to siphon off money into his offshore accounts before disappearing into oblivion and leaving Jack to take the fall.\r\n</p><p>\r\nCox has it all planned and knows how to break Jack down and make him do whatever he wants. After several failed attempts at breaking his family free from the hostage takers, Jack begrudgingly agrees to hack into the security system that he personally designed for the bank. With his family's life in danger, he sees no other way out.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOnly one catch, Cox is a ruthless efficient thief and Jack knows that once he has the money, he won't hesitate in tidying up the various loose ends. Once he has fulfilled Cox's greed, Jack is no longer needed and his family have been abducted. Jack must fight and he is hell bent on getting his family back, whatever it may take.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFord is a convincing hero in this film, playing a similar role in earlier thrillers such as The Fugitive, although perhaps a little too old for the vicious fight scenes.  Bettany comes across well as the English baddie and Madsen puts in another great performance as the headstrong wife following her impressive role in Sideways.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFirewall is an exciting and eventful thriller with a good back story and well chosen cast.  Fans of <i>Hostage</i>, <i>Cellular</i> and <i>Swordfish</i> are sure to love this movie.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	231	2011-03-26
232	1	15	\N	Serenity	<p>Buffy the Vampire Slayer would be the obvious choice if a big screen adventure were to be made of one of creator Joss Whedon's small screen successes. Certainly not Firefly, a very short lived science fiction series that was cancelled from American television schedules for attracting too small an audience. Happily for fans, however, Whedon wasn't prepared to give up on Firefly and managed somehow to convince Universal pictures to let him transfer his story about a group of space renegades to the cinema. We should all be grateful.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Sinister faceless government The Alliance have been conducting experiments on telepathic teenager River to turn her into an arse kicking killing machine. Unwilling to leave the young woman in their evil clutches, River's older brother Simon breaks her out and takes passage on the rust bucket starship Serenity run by space cowboy Mal Reynolds(Nathan Fillion).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately for the two runaway's, as well as Mal and the rest of his crew, River was once left in the company of the Alliance's top brass and may have been able to pick up on the dirty little secrets lurking in the dark recesses of their minds. Now the Captain, who spends much of his time flying on the wrong side of the law anyway, must escape the attentions of an Alliance fleet and a Government sponsored assassin out for River's blood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joss Whedon's sci-fi swashbuckler is far closer in spirit to George Lucas' 1977 <i>Star Wars</i> than anything the man himself has managed to reproduce in his trilogy of disappointing prequels. Certainly the difference in budgets is noticeable with Serenity making do with a relatively brief space ship battle and far less special effects. Instead Whedon's universe is populated with actual characters and a genuine sense of humour, both attributes in short supply during this year's <i>Revenge of the Sith</i>. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>With over a dozen or so television episodes worth of character back-story there was the possibility that the plot would prove to be an impenetrable barrier to those unfamiliar with the original series, but as someone who has never seen an episode of Firefly, I found the story perfectly comprehensible even if the introduction of an extra passenger, and presumably series regular, an hour into the film seemed unnecessary on an already crowded ship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With almost the entire cast made up of actors from the television series there are no star names for the audience to latch onto, although Nathan Fillion does have the charisma to succeed as a leading man. Alternatively the lack of recognisable faces adds an extra sense of jeopardy in a film which is prepared to shed its heroes' blood. The death of central characters certainly packs quite a punch in this movie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the side of evil, British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor (Kinky Boots) is mesmerising as the Operative, a sword wielding assassin tasked with hunting down River. Less menacing are the Reavers, a tribe of cannibalistic humans who look a bit like members of a failed rock band. The level of makeup required to bring these creatures to life doesn't seem to have been available, although they prove themselves to be a credible threat during a memorable finale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Serenity won't revolutionise science fiction the way <i>Star Wars</i> or <i>The Matrix</i> did, and it may not even manage to attract a huge audience, but for a purely entertaining night out at the movies Serenity can't be faulted.</p>\r\n	5	2011-03-26	232	2011-03-26
233	1	20	\N	Mrs Henderson Presents	<p>Set back in the 1930's, Mrs Henderson Presents tells the humorous true story of a wealthy widower (Judi Dench - Pride & Prejudice) who, having found herself alone in society, decides to purchase and fix up a derelict theatre, The Windmill. Unfamiliar with the theatre business, the ambitious Mrs Henderson hires a professional manager, Vivian Van Damm (Bob Hoskins - Unleashed), to help take over the day to day management of the theatre and to bring a new show to the stage. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vivian is a great director with vision and a good business sense and before long The Windmill has reinvented itself by shedding the traditional Matinee in preference for non-stop performances throughout the day and evening. Sadly this novel idea is soon copied and once again Vivian finds himself knocking on the door of creativity. Who should answer but none other than the interfering battleaxe Mrs Henderson with an idea for an artistic review show akin to the Moulin Rouge, if a little less gaudy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With strong opposition from the reserved establishment and great support from the general population, Mrs Henderson successfully brought nudity to the west end stage and once again the Windmill was the centre of attention. As war ripped through London and the blitz closed down other theatres, The Windmill was the only place that played on and to packed audiences. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fans of Judi Dench are in for a treat as she steals the show with a combination of class, wit and perfect comic delivery. As Laura Henderson, a wealthy lady growing old disgracefully, Dench gets the chance to deliver both an emotional performance and yet add some great wit to stir up the mix and to remind audiences you don't have to be a blonde bombshell to turn heads and cause a sensation. This buoyant yet determined character contrasts well with the more stable and sensible character of Vivian Van Damm (Hoskins), a man with two feet solidly on the ground and a good sense of responsibility. Hoskins' character is the perfect counterbalance to Mrs Henderson and the chemistry between these two opposing forces, crucial to the film, is fantastic. Often underrated, Bob Hoskins reminds us that he is one of England's finest actors and with this film even adds the title of producer to his CV as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dench and Hoskins are a great double act and this acidic relationship forms the centre piece for the movie. In support newcomer Kelly Reilly, recently seen in Pride & Prejudice, will make the jaws drop as the Windmill's leading lady Maureen, while Will Young makes an acting debut as the theatre's musical maestro and singing sensation, Bertie, a gay man dodging the war. Worry ye not, Mr Young keeps his clothes on throughout, although the same may not be said for a certain pivotal character and I'm not talking about Dame Judi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a blend of humour, nudity and wartime spirit, Mrs Henderson is a singular film that should entertain a wide audience. Not exactly the popcorn movie of the year, this film is aimed at the more mature audience but still offers some great fun for the young adult audience. Strongly recommended for fans of <i>"The Full Monty"</i> and <i>"Calendar Girls"</i>.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	233	2011-03-26
236	1	15	\N	Keeping Mum	<p>Gloria Goodfellow is not happy. Her outwardly idyllic existence in the village of Little Wallop is in fact a sham. She constantly bickers with her promiscuous teenage daughter and her son is being bullied at school. The neighbour's dog is keeping her awake at night and her husband, the Reverend Walter Goodfellow, is too busy being pestered by his parishioners to show some love or affection to his neglected wife who is on the verge of beginning an illicit affair with her golf instructor, Lance (Patrick Swayze - Ghost). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as Gloria plans to abandon her family to flee to Mexico with the lecherous Lance, a new housekeeper arrives in the form of Grace, a mysterious old lady with a friendly demeanour and a talent for eliminating the Goodfellow families' problems. All of Grace's solutions, however, seem to involve the disappearance of a member of the Little Wallop community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This traditional British comedy is reminiscent of the classic Ealing Studio films of the fifties with its leisurely pace and gentle humour. Kristin Scott Thomas (The English Patient) provides a good central performance as the exasperated Gloria, a woman who can't decide what she wants from life. She also has great scenes sparring with the smarmy Swayze who is clearly having a lot of fun sending up his smooth operator performance from Dirty Dancing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maggie Grace (Gosford Park) is of course superb playing Mary Poppins with an axe. Her dotty attitude to life, and other people's deaths, is amusingly forthright. She generates much of the film's funny moments, although this old fashioned middle England comedy doesn't exactly have the laugh out loud jokes that the gross-out comedy crowd thrive on. Rowan Atkinson (Johnny English) is admirably restrained in his portrayal of the Reverend Goodfellow and avoids the temptation to slip into his old Mr Bean routine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite being a perfectly pleasant romp in the country, the film does have its flaws. None of the plot developments or the victims who are bumped off is that surprising and once Grace's secret is iscovered the film simply peters out instead of raising the stakes and reaching a satisfying climax. More importantly, however, the film fails to settle on an audience. The movie is much too tame to appeal to  teenagers but the middle aged audience and older, who will undoubtedly enjoy much of the film, may be put off by some unnecessary nudity from the very attractive Tamsin Egerton who plays Gloria's daughter Holly and the liberal use of swearing that seems to be obligatory in all British comedies since Four Weddings and a Funeral. These unwise decisions go some way to spoil an otherwise highly recommended film for a Sunday afternoon with the Grandparents.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	236	2011-03-26
237	1	20	\N	The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe	<p>First, please let me apologise for the delay in writing this review. The five stars suggest this film is something special and indeed it is, so why did I not write the review earlier? Because I was busy, this is Christmas, and also a certain hundred foot ape got in between me and the laptop. Anyway enough of my petty excuses, on with the review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lucy, Edmund, Susan and Peter are four siblings from the Pevensie family who are sent to live with an obscure professor (Jim Broadbent - Valiant) out in the countryside to escape the wartime bombing of London.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Away from everyone they know and trapped indoors by the relentless English weather, the children decide to play hide and seek in their new home. As Peter counts to 100 the others scatter to find somewhere to hide. Susan hides in a trunk and Edmund hides behind a curtain but poor Lucy has trouble finding somewhere until she stumbles upon a spare room, empty all except for a large wardrobe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Lucy climbs into the wardrobe and shuffles to the back behind fur coats, she feels snow under her feet. She looks behind her and to her amazement she has stumbled into a whole new other world, Narnia. There she meets the kind faun Mr Tumnus (James McAvoy - Wimbledon) and learns that the world of Narnia is in the terrible grip of an endless winter cast by the White Witch (Tilda Swinton - Constantine).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Excited by her discovery and fearful of the witch, Lucy rushes back through the wardrobe to tell her disbelieving siblings about the winter world within the wardrobe. After a few more boring days in reality, Lucy returns to Narnia followed by her naughty brother Edmund. While Lucy has tea with Tumnus, Edmund meets the White Witch who wins him over with Turkish delight and hot chocolate. Seduced by promises of wealth and power (and more Turkish delight), Edmund agrees to return to Narnia and deliver his siblings to her. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the sons of Adam and daughters of Eve return to Narnia, they find themselves drawn into a fantastic adventure full of magic and peril. Edmund's betrayal of his family will lead each of them on a path to fulfil their destiny by helping the good creatures and their lion king, Aslan (voice by Liam Neeson - Batman Begins), to confront the White Witch and a battle to save Narnia. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Written by C. S. Lewis in 1948, The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe was the first of seven stories that became collectively titled "The Chronicles of Narnia". Apparently C. S. Lewis started work on the chronicles in 1939 when he himself opened his house to shelter some children evacuated from the blitz. Written out of chronological order, the seven tales touch upon elements of Christianity and morality reflecting C. S. Lewis's own real crisis of faith. More child-friendly than Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Chronicles of Narnia has inspired the imagination of millions of children and at last it is on the big screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Director Andrew Adamson (Shrek and Shrek 2) has moved away from animation but remains deeply immersed in magic and fairytales. Anyone who has read and enjoyed the book should be delighted with the film as it is a faithful adaptation and has a good script.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The numerous special effects and set pieces are sumptuous and sincere to the book, especially the creatures of Narnia. Mr & Mrs Beaver (voiced by Ray Winstone - King Arthur, and Dawn French - Harry Potter 3) and the numerous minotaurs, centaurs, fauns, eagles, rhino's and the scary wolf police, are all realistic and credible. However, the grandest creation must surely be Aslan the lion. An animator's nightmare, a talking lion with fur and a bushy mane that fights witches and spouts wisdom, Aslan must have been a challenge and they have done a great job. Larger than your normal lion and with one of the most emotional scenes, the CGI Aslan was a success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turning now to the human cast, the children in this movie were all very good but none really shone out other than young Georgie Henley, a ten-year-old newcomer, who put in a grand lead performance as Lucy. In the adult cast, Jim Broadbent was suitably eccentric as Professor Kirke while Tilda Swinton was cold, merciless and terrifying as the White Witch, a role surely to be remembered as a high point. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in this is a great film, the few minor blips in acting here and there are easily outweighed by the fine effects, the good pace and the strong storyline. A great book and now a great film, the audience was delighted by the movie and the kids in our screening were hooked from beginning to end. Some adults may feel the film is a little long in the middle but this does not seem to have dampened the film for its real audience who laughed with jokes, gasped at the surprises and could even be heard to weep a little in the sadder scenes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Go and see it while you can, the landscape shots demand it. A great movie sure to become a classic and hopefully the beginning of a franchise. Watch out Potter, there are six more stories yet!</p>\r\n	5	2011-03-26	237	2011-03-26
238	1	20	\N	King Kong	<p>Hello and welcome to "Who is having a bad day?"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Contestant Number One:</b> "Hi, I'm an up and coming movie director with some minor financial difficulties but that\r\n ain't what's ruining my day. I came into possession of a map to a mythical island where I hoped to shoot the best movie \r\nof all time and now half my crew have been eaten by the local wildlife. Does anyone care about my filming schedule? Just \r\nbecause a gang of local semi-naked tribe people like to sacrifice the occasional blonde to a gigantic ape doesn't mean we \r\ncan't make a film. I mean, everyone points fingers at me as if it's my fault that we may die. Come on! Can't you see that \r\nthere's money to be made."</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Contestant Number Two:</b> "Hello everyone, I am a screenwriter who has been trapped on board a ship for god knows \r\nhow long by a corrupt movie director. He has dragged me off to some island in the mild of the ocean where we have been \r\nset upon by tribal people and now I am running through a jungle looking for a blonde. Bad day? I love this girl, she's \r\nsmart and beautiful but she has been abducted by a huge gorilla. I have braved swamps and dinosaurs and some of my friends \r\nhave just been eaten by huge worms but it'll be worth it. I hope. Saying that, I have a sneaky feeling she loves the ape \r\nmore than me."</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Contestant Number Three:</b> "Okay, you guys just don't know how lucky you are. I am hanging from the teeth of a \r\nt-rex swinging above the open mouth of another t-rex. Swinging? Yeah, didn't I mention that both the t-rex's and I are \r\ncaught up in vines hanging in a ravine half a mile deep? Oh and to cap it off I have a horny hundred foot ape trying to \r\nchat me up."</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So who is having a bad day? The answer is a few paragraphs down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, it's finally here, Peter "Lord of the Rings" Jackson's remake of the 1933 classic, King Kong. After the critically \r\nacclaimed LOTR trilogy, Jackson has returned to one of his favourite movies to give the big ape a new look for the twenty \r\nfirst century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story, for those who haven't seen the original, follows a film director and his crew as they travel to a remote \r\nisland where they stumble upon an ancient civilisation and begin an amazing adventure. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>A native tribe abduct the film crew's leading lady, Ann Darrow, and offer her as a sacrifice to the legendary "Kong",\r\n a huge grey back gorilla that dominates the island, except for the small human settlement hidden safely behind a colossal \r\nwall. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kong takes Ann deep into the jungle where he looks after her as his pet and protects her from the wild flesh-eating \r\ndinosaurs that share the jungle. Meanwhile, the film crew pass behind the wall and travel into the jungle to rescue Ann \r\nand trap the great Kong. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subdued, the mighty ape is transported back to New York to be the centre piece of a stage show chronicling the film \r\ncrew's brave adventures but Kong doesn't like the show and instead breaks free and wreaks havoc in New York.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who is having a bad day? Kong of course! Abducted from his home and in love with a fragile beauty, he finds himself \r\nlost in a confusing world full of enemies. Seeking peace, he climbs the tallest tower and declares his love before being \r\nkilled by fighter jets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So is it good? It's great! A tragic story and fantastic action extravaganza packed with great set pieces and moments \r\nof horror and comedy side-by-side. Naomi Watts (The Ring 2) is by far the star of the show as Ann Darrow, a nave woman \r\ndragged into an epic adventure. The majority of her scenes are just her and "Kong" and so she has to interact with nothing \r\nand yet portray every emotion from happiness, to fear, to horror, to love and finally, to loss. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>By comparison Adrien Brody (The Pianist) comes off as a weak doomed character as the loving scriptwriter who will \r\ntackle any beast to save Ann from the monsters of Skull Island. Brody's character spends most of the time fighting or \r\nrunning so you barely make much contact with him until near the end when in New York he has a confrontation with Kong \r\nover beautiful Ann. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Making up the trio of human characters, Jack Black (School of Rock) is excellent as the corrupt movie director, \r\nCarl Denham. Determined to shoot his movie no matter what and with an eye for money-making opportunities out of every \r\ndisaster, Carl is a vulgar character yet he offers some great humour at the same time. Black, a less than obvious \r\nchoice for the part, is great and can list this on his best performance list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally we get to Kong, the King, the main guy we have come to see. He is great. Acted by Andy Serkis (Gollum in Lord \r\nof the Rings) and enhanced by the special effects wizards at WETA, Kong is very realistic despite his gigantic proportions. \r\nJackson has managed to cram a great amount of emotion into Kong so that you really empathise with his doomed visit to New \r\nYork and its inevitable consequences. Sadly, the same special effects that make Kong so great also lose the movie that \r\nfinal fifth star.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This film was only ever going to be as good as its special effects and while the movie is crammed with beasts and bugs, \r\nancient ruins and fantastic landscapes, certain scenes look overly generated. Am I being a snob? Probably, but when we \r\nknow what can be done and have seen the great LOTR trilogy, is it snobby to expect the same high standard for Kong? The\r\n pacing of the movie, the development of characters, the acting, the music, the style, and the emotional balance are all \r\ngreat. It's just that the effects in some scenes were overly obvious and the spell was broken for a few moments. Sorry PJ,\r\n this isn't your best, but it is great nonetheless.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	238	2011-03-26
240	1	20	\N	The Producers	<p>Following the smash success of Mel Brook's musical adaptation of his own film, The Producers (1976), that musical has itself been made into a film. Does that sound a little mad? Well, so is Mel Brooks and this musical is evidence to prove it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The producers tells the simple story of an unscrupulous Broadway producer Max (Nathan Lane - Nicholas Nickleby) and his neurotic but ambitious accountant Leo (Matthew Broderick - Godzilla), who between them concoct a plan to make millions out of a theatrical flop. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Theoretically if they sell more percentage shares in the play than actually exist but ensure the play bombs at the box office, they can keep the raised capital without anyone knowing. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>To ensure the show is a flop, they find the worst play ever written, hire the worst director and worst actors and then wait for the show to collapse. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Nazi sympathiser, Hans (Will Ferrell - Bewitched), wrote the worst play, a romantic retelling of world war two idolising Hitler. This travesty is further worsened when newly appointed transvestite director Roger Debris (Gary Beach - Queer as Folk [US TV]) rewrites the story with a happy ending and fills the play with gay dancing soldiers. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>All is set for the worst musical ever as Max and Leo marvel at their own brilliant disaster and rake in all the cash provided by the lovelorn elderly women seduced by Max into funding the show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crammed with songs and punchy gags this is a refreshing revamp of a classic comedy. Dissimilar to recent 'conventional' comedies such as <i>'The Wedding Crashers'</i> or <i>'The 40 Year Old Virgin'</i>, both great in their own right, The Producers is the return of Mel Brooks' humour, and a musical filled with slapstick and sarcasm wrapped around a healthy dose of political incorrectness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Matthew Broderick is entertaining as the spineless accountant Leo and manages to both sing and dance brilliantly while keeping up the straight act alongside the exaggerated and aggressive performance of Nathan Lane as Max. Stealing the show from scene one, Nathan Lane puts so much energy into his performance that he must surely win an award, of some sort, be it a gold figurine or a straight jacket. The film had many a fine actor or actress dotted about but Nathan Lane carried the movie single handed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In support Gary Breach was hilarious as transsexual Roger, the famed director. Camping it up to excess in every scene and his constant bantering with his common law assistant Carmen (Roger Bart - The Stepford Wives), Beach adds to the eccentricity of the film and has possibly one of the funniest songs 'Keep it gay'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along the way we also meet Uma Thurman (Be Cool) as a Swedish wannabe starlet, Ulla, and Will Ferrell who was rather annoying as the Nazi playwright. Ferrell has been in too many things lately and while he is a great comedian his particular brand of humour has become sadly tired. Thurman, on the other hand, was great, wearing flattering feminine outfits and oozing sex appeal, deserving her 'standing ovation'. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mel Brooks' comedies have always been a bit off the wall and satirical. Somehow he has managed to convert one of his own classic films, possibly his best, into a stage musical. He has then taken it a step further, with the assistance of director Susan Stroman, and converted his own musical adaptation into a movie musical. Talk about milking a concept! Luckily, it works. The stage show is a huge success on both sides of the pond and this latest movie is great fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Faults? Some may say it has too many songs or that it is all a little over the top. That is Mel Brooks' style though, madcap and funny. If you're a fan of Mel Brooks' comedies such as <i>'Blazing Saddles'</i>, <i>'Young Frankenstein'</i> or <i>'Spaceballs'</i>, this is strongly recommended.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	240	2011-03-26
241	1	15	\N	March of the Penguins	<p>More than once during the fascinating documentary March of the Penguins, I expected the husky voice of Morgan Freeman's narration to intone that the Penguins regarded our world with envious eyes and, slowly, drew their plans against us. Mr Freeman has had a busy summer what with a role in Batman Begins as well as narrating Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds. Unsurprisingly both were big hits at the American box office but the success of French director Luc Jacquet's documentary about the migration of emperor penguins was certainly less predictable.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>By the end of October the antics of thousands of waddling birds struggling across the ice had earned a whopping $76 million making it the second highest grossing documentary of all time and leaving big budget action flicks like The Island trailing in its wake. The figure only gets more impressive when you consider that the film originally opened on a measly four screens back in June.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Thankfully the UK is getting the chance to experience this charming film just in time for Christmas and it is great viewing for the entire family. Adults will marvel at the astonishing cinematography that captures the thin black and white line of birds as they trudge across the bleak Antarctic waste lands towards their mating fields. Kids will love the occasionally clumsy creatures as they sledge themselves from place to place while their young scamper about in circles. Kids, however, may not like the harsher aspects of existence at the bottom of the world. I used to find seals endearingly cute but not when viewed from the perspective of a penguin on the wrong end of a set of formidable jaws. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>On the negative side the narration can be a little light on information at times with Morgan admitting all too often that scientists just don't know why the penguins sometimes do the things they do. I couldn't help but feel you would never hear David Attenborough say such a thing. Even more annoying is the twee soundtrack which is intrusive and frequently irritating. These small flaws aside, March of the Penguins is an enchanting film that will make you grateful you're wrapped up warm this winter in a heated cinema and not standing huddled together by the thousand in 160mph winds.</p>\r\n\r\n	4	2011-03-26	241	2011-03-26
242	1	23	\N	Breakfast on Pluto	<p>Vampires, adulterous couples, gangsters, nightmarish dreams and murderous youths all feature in the diverse back-catalogue of Irish director Neil Jordan. Despite this mixed body of work, he is best remembered for throwing terrorism and transvestism together in <i>"The Crying Game"</i>. Both of these themes are revisited in <i>Breakfast on Pluto</i>, but it is by no means a tired re-hash of old material. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jordan's latest offering is a bold, original film in its own right, which just happens to feature some scarily convincing cross-dressing and the IRA. Whereas The Crying Game is stark and gritty, Breakfast on Pluto filters its colourful narrative - set in a dark, unsettled period of British history - through the fantastical eye's of its androgynous narrator, Patrick "kitten" Braden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patrick is born in a Southern Irish village in 1958, the lovechild of a priest, Father Bernard (Liam Neeson), and his beautiful housekeeper, who then dumps him on the clergyman's doorstep and flees the village in disgrace. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>He is taken in by a local woman, Ma Braden, who doesn't take kindly to the discovery that Patrick feels more comfortable in his sister's clothes and make-up than being a good catholic boy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One hilarious scene shows the aghast Ma Braden giving Patrick a football magazine to toughen him up, only for him to turn it around and look at the muscle-bound torso of a boy on the back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the glam 1970s his self-styled "kitten" alter ego soon comes to the fore and the teenage Patrick struts his stuff in make-up, sequins and dresses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This penchant for the flamboyant marks him as an obvious target in a strict Catholic community, but Patrick has a close knit group of friends that value him for what he is. \r\nHowever, his teachers are not so liberal and he is expelled from school for one to many outrageous pranks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Things go well for a while, as he falls in with a touring glam rock band and into bed with the mutton chopped lead singer Billy Hatchet (Gavin Friday). But after a first hand encounter with the IRA, he decides to set off to London to find his mother.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the "city that never sleeps", as he refers to it, he gets into a series of scrapes, ranging from the amusing - takes on a job as womble impersonator - to horrific - gets embroiled in an IRA bombing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cillian Murphy (Red Eye) chalks up an incredible multi-layered performance as Patrick. He conveys his sense of fun and sexuality, while also subtly bringing out the sadness at his core. He conjures the impression of an intelligent, charismatic, fiercely individualistic boy whose endless role playing and fantasising attempt to bring glamour and colour into a drab, dark world. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>So when Patrick hits the streets as a rent boy he's still humming his tunes, or when he's locked in a police cell being beaten black-and-blue, he musters up a bizarre, fantastical confession casts him as a cat-suit clad spy, taking out an IRA terrorist cell with laconic puffs of Chanel No 5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neil Jordan's use of elements of fantasy, like subtitled gossiping robins, or a rose that a magician produces from a mug in a greasy spoon, show that, to Patrick, the power of the imagination is everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also conveys this in the film's colour scheme, by contrasting drab tones with blasts of colour, often from Patrick clothes, or the many roses littering the film's exquisitely composed frames.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The support cast are uniformly excellent, from the ever-reliable Brendan Gleeson as Patrick's pissed-up womble-boss, to Jordan regular Stephen Rea as a melancholic magician who takes a shine to Patrick and puts him in his act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Former Roxy Music frontman Brian Ferry also shines in a cameo as a sinister killer.  In an unassuming role, Liam Neeson does a great job of conveying Father Brennan's internal torment at not being able to recognise Patrick as his son. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, Breakfast on Pluto succeeds because of Cillian Murphy. Patrick's character is in practically ever scene and anything less than an outstanding performance would mean the whole thing fails. Luckily Murphy is nothing short of exceptional.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	242	2011-03-26
243	1	23	\N	Match Point	<p>"There are moments in a match when the ball hits the top of the net and for a second it can go either forward or fall back. With a little luck it goes forward and you win. Or maybe it doesn't and you lose." Match Point opens with this fatalistic statement, as a slow-mo tennis ball clips the net and loops perilously in the ether between success and failure. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Woody Allen must have felt a little like this when he left New York and decamped to London to shoot it. In terms of familiarity, the ball is well and truly up in the air. Match Point contains no neurotic to camera addresses, no Manhattan, no psychiatrists, no Woody playing himself, or some hapless schmuck trying and failing to play Woody (stand up Jason Biggs). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Match Point serves aces in every department. The London setting, incredible cast, devilish plot twists and delicious mix of light and pitch-black humour make it Woody's best film since Hannah and her Sisters (1986). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Set among well-to-do Londoners, the story opens with former pro Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers - Vanity Fair) getting a coaching job at an exclusive London tennis club. Intent on leaving his modest background behind and climbing the social classes, he coaches and befriends young toff Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode - Chasing Liberty) and is soon ingratiating himself with Tom's wealthy parents Eleanor (Penelope Wilton - Pride & Prejudice) and Alec (Brian Cox - Troy). </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's not long before he's engaging in some after hour's ball sports with Tom's nave sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer - Dear Frankie) and then his beautiful American fiancee Nola (Scarlett Johansson - The Island). When this affair begins to compromise the life of comfort that the membership of the Hewett family brings, Chris has a difficult decision to make. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays Chris as a blank canvas, a man willing to play roles to climb the social classes at any cost. It's shown early on with Chris faking refinement by reading Dostoyevsky notes guides and bluffing his enjoyment of opera, but as he marries Emily and continues his affair with Nora, his deceptions become more and more desperate and dangerous. \r\nScarlett Johansson's Nora is the emotional heart of Match Point. In early scenes Johansson sets Nora up as a glamorous femme fatale, all pouting lips and coy glances, but then reveals layer-after-layer, creating a character that is insecure, flawed, but entirely human. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>One moment in which she accosts Chris in the street and repeatedly and uncontrollably screams: "you lied!" in his face, before being bundled into a taxi, is hypnotic in its power. It's Oscar worthy stuff for sure. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Woody always needed a female muse to make great films, he has found one to rival Mia Farrow or Diane Keaton. Also, maybe London inspires him in the way that New York seems to have stopped doing. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>He shoots the capital with simplicity, neither over egging its grandeur or emphasising its squalor, as many American directors might. The manner in which he paints the English upper crust is also sensitive, making them nave, comic and dumb, without ever ignoring their power or descending in to parody. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is this sensitivity and deftness that makes it such an amusing, engaging and, in the final revelatory act, shocking watch. Match Point? More like game, set, and match.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	243	2011-03-26
245	1	15	\N	Ice Age 2	<p>Manny, Sid and Diego, the mismatched Mammoth, Sloth and Sabre Tooth Tiger from the hit animated adventure <i>Ice Age</i>, are back and are living out the cold temperatures in a frost ringed valley with a host of assorted new creatures for company. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe expanded herd spends its days tormenting clumsy Sid (voiced by John Leguizamo - Assault on Precinct 13) and splashing about in the waterfalls that rush down from the surrounding cliffs. \r\n</p><p>\r\nTheir idyllic existence is about to be change, however, when a messenger in the form of a hungry vulture informs the ignorant mammals that high above them the ice is breaking up and a vast swell of water is about to flood their home. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAlthough actual ice in Ice Age: The Meltdown is something of a rarity for much of the film, the odd bunch of migrating mammals still have plenty of trouble to deal with in the form of the rapidly rising water. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDiego (voiced by Denis Leary - Ice Age), in particular, is having a hard time since the fearless predator can't actually swim. Sid has troubles of his own as he struggles to be taken seriously by his friends and Manny (voiced by Ray Romano - The King of Queens [TV]) must face up to the fact that he's the last surviving member of his species. \r\n</p><p>\r\nChildren will universally love this film with its zany characters and the return of the prehistoric squirrel that just won't give up its acorn but it doesn't quite have the crossover appeal that adults have enjoyed with Pixar's efforts. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe film gets bogged down in a pretty dull love story that may even leave the kids yawning as grumpy Manny finds himself considering continuing the survival of his species with a nutty female (voiced by Queen Latifah - Last Holiday) called Ellie. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe animation is superb but overall the film is weaker than the original. It simply has too much going on and the enlarged group of characters means that old favourites like Diego get less screen time. A pair of vicious looking sea monster villains are introduced but are then barely used. While Ice Age: The Meltdown doesn't measure up to its inventive predecessor it does at least come up tops when compared to that other bloated animated sequel <i>Shrek 2</i>.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	245	2011-03-26
246	1	12	\N	Memoirs of a Geisha	<p>At the age of nine, Chiyo (Suzuka Ohgo / Zhang Ziyi - <i>House Of Flying Daggers</i>) is taken from her remote fishing village to the city of Miako to become an apprentice geisha. Over the long years, she rebels against the restrictions imposed upon her and clashes again and again with a bitter rival, Hatsumomo (Gong Li - <i>2046</i>), but eventually she succeeds in becoming the city's most famous geisha. Now known as Sayuri, she has achieved great fame and wealth, but can she also find the one thing that geishas cannot have? Love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given that this film was directed by an American, stars Chinese actresses in the lead roles and was filmed primarily on set in the US with English dialogue, authenticity was never going to be high on its list of qualities. However, the original book was written in English by an American and much of its credibility stemmed from the extensive interviews between the author, Arthur Golden, and a prominent geisha. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the casting was announced the Japanese were outraged, and strangely enough so were the Chinese, accusing Zhang of betraying her country to its WW2 oppressor. Why such a big fuss over this particular film? It could be argued that Westerners think that all Orientals are the same and that one is as good as another for the purposes of Hollywood. Then again, Liam Neeson played a German in <i>Schindler's List</i> and no one complained about that. The issue at hand isn't the casting of non-Japanese actresses, rather the decision to use English dialogue along with non-native speakers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ziyi Zhang <i>can</i> act; just watch <i>2046</i> for proof. What she falls foul of in this film is something I'm going to call "Penelope Cruz Syndrome", whereby a good actor or actress comes across as a wooden plank when faced with having to use English as a foreign language. Zhang falls, and she falls hard. Some of the other actors and actresses struggle as well, Ken Watanabe faring badly in this regard, but Zhang is the one who stands out most prominently. This isn't all that surprising when you consider that two years ago she couldn't speak a word of English. Zhang was chosen because she is young, beautiful and she can dance. The first two criteria could have been fulfilled by any number of actresses, and the last is a weak reason when the film only has one proper dance. A good dance for all that, but still just the one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there is the problem of her co-stars. In an example of art imitating life, the gradual eclipsing of Hatsumomo by Chiyo/Sayuri's rising star mirrors that of the real-life fortunes of Gong Li and Ziyi Zhang. Nevertheless Li is still China's best actress, if no longer its most famous, and she acts Zhang off the screen each and every single time they are paired together. If there's any justice in the acting world, she'll win a Best Supporting Actress Oscar. Not only that, Michelle Yeoh (<i>Tomorrow Never Dies</i>) as Chiyo's tutor, Mamaha, has a natural elegance and poise that Zhang is unable to muster, and even Suzuka Ohgo as Chiyo's younger self evokes a greater emotional response than Zhang in her very first film. It's not a bad thing to have such an ensemble of great acting talent in a single film, one in which the story focuses on the relationships and rivalries between women, but in the end the film is about one character and Zhang doesn't meet the standard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chances are that you will completely disagree with me. My main issue is with Zhang after all, and in other areas the film is outstanding. It is well-paced, slowly developing the character of Chiyo the younger, before introducing Zhang as the older Chiyo and stepping up the conflict between Chiyo and Hatsumomo to open warfare. It is also beautifully shot. There is a reliance on scenes always used in Western-directed films set in Japan, such as mountains wreathed in mist and sunset/sunrise shots of a multi-tiered pagoda in silhouette, but there are good reasons for that. These scenes have a natural beauty of their own that is quintessentially Japanese, so one cannot entirely fault the director for choosing as many have done before. Also impressive on the visual front are the intricate kimonos worn by the various geisha throughout the film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being a fan of Japanese culture and of Gong Li, I am undoubtedly biased. For all my hopes of an adaptation made in Japanese with an all-Japanese cast, this was never going to happen with an $85 million film based on a best-selling book. Putting that aside, the fact remains that the film hangs on the performance of Ziyi Zhang in her first English language role, and she is unable to fulfil that which is required of her.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	246	2011-03-26
247	1	20	\N	V for Vendetta	<p>From the creators of the Matrix trilogy, and the imagination of Alan Moore, comes a dark vision of the future. But who is Alan Moore and why is his name so small on the poster? We'll handle that later, first off lets prcis the movie.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSet in the near future, the population of England is suppressed under the tyranny of a radical right wing government. One evening a young lady, Evey (Natalie Portman - Closer), breaks an imposed curfew to try and reach a friend's house for dinner but is set upon by three lecherous and corrupt law officers. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAs her attackers close in and Evey prepares for the worst a saviour arrives; a mysterious cloaked and masked man with a penchant for poetry and word play. Within moments the eloquent hero has brandished hidden daggers and defeated Evey's numerous attackers. \r\n</p><p>\r\nRecovering from her ordeal, Evey is invited by her saviour, introduced as V, to a rooftop to witness an amazing sight. \r\n</p><p>\r\nV (Hugo Weaving - LOTR), a radical terrorist opposed to the government has secretly been planning a major coup and that night, 4th November, on the strike of midnight the first step in his plan will be revealed.  The Old Bailey, the old and disgraced palace of fallen justice, is blown up to the orchestral finale of Tchaikovsky's 1812 overture. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe next day rumours start to spread but Evey, back in her usual world of admin within the government TV network, remains silent about her hero V. As the government attempts to spin the destruction of the Old Bailey and delude the public using the TV station, V unexpectedly arrives and presents his own programme inviting people to join him one year later to celebrate Guy Fawkes night with an attack on government itself. Surrounded, V fights his way free of the building but Evey is drawn into the conflict and finds herself an unwilling guest in V's hideout.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAn enemy of the state and V's captive, Evey watches as V's plan slowly unfolds and in her isolation she starts to question the government that rules England and the mystery surrounding V. Meanwhile, government officer Finch (Stephen Rea - Breakfast on Pluto), tasked with arresting V, follows clues linking V's attacks and follows a similar path to Evey. As Finch joins the dots he slowly uncovers a painful truth behind several world changing events. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSo, who is Alan Moore? Akin to Frank Miller, Alan Moore has been credited with reinvigorating the comic book industry. A UK writer and artist, Moore created several of the most challenging and endearing graphic novels of all time and is rated as one of the greatest comic writers. With Hollywood studios racing to make the latest and greatest superhero movie it wouldn't take long for Hollywood to tap into the great Alan Moore. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSo what did he write? Well, the most famous movie adaptation of his works would undoubtedly be 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'. Don't let that put you off. The comic was far greater than the dismal movie. Similarly, 'From Hell' was based upon a short series penned by Moore and once again exceeded the lacklustre movie adaptation.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWith lavish sets and fine acting from the entire cast, V for Vendetta has style and some substance. I have yet to read the graphic novel myself but fans have commented that the movie did not fully live up to expectation. As a movie fan I'd say that this is by far the most thought-provoking action movie I have seen in recent years, although it is a tad slow in the second third. Shave off ten minutes and add a few more twists (Hollywood hammers home the subtle points in case you don't see them), this would have been a five star movie.\r\n</p><p>\r\nStrongly recommended for all fans of action movies and political thrillers, especially the dark and contemplative <i>Batman Begins</i>, <i>Sin City</i> and <i>The Matrix</i> movies.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	247	2011-03-26
248	1	20	\N	Casanova	<p>A classic antihero, Casanova was a libertine who reportedly seduced ten thousand ladies during a life time of debauchery. Who Casanova really was or if he even existed is a matter of debate. Far be it for Hollywood to shed any light on the matter but the legend of Casanova certainly has potential for a fun romantic comedy and possibly a good box office taking.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter his serious Oscar contention role in Brokeback Mountain, Heath Ledger returns to comedy playing the suave and seductive Casanova. Set in Venice, Casanova is portrayed as vain and dandy, he seduces his way through the female population while keeping one step away from the hangman's noose thanks to the protection of a forgiving noble.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter one too many nights of pleasure with a nun, Casanova is arrested once again and dragged before the court. Pardoned for a final time, Casanova is ordered to marry otherwise face banishment from Venice and his flock of admirers.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMeanwhile a young ambitious girl, Francesca (Sienna Miller - Alfie), doomed to a marriage with a distant merchant, dreams of freedom and writes pamphlets on the rights of women. Francesca's writings, published under a pseudonym, anger the church which seeks to charge the unknown author with the crime of heresy.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAcross town Casanova ponders his situation. For such an egotistical hedonist the idea of monogamy is unsettling but whoever said marriage had to be monogamous? He quickly finds a fiance much to the chagrin of a neighbouring voyeur who confronts Casanova and demands a duel. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAt the morning duel Casanova crosses swords with a worthy opponent and after several minutes of frantic fighting his opponent is exposed as not the lovesick wet voyeur but none other than Francesca, fighting on his behalf. Finally our dissimilar heroes meet and, of course, clash terribly.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWhile Francesca returns to her stressful battle with the male dominated bureaucracy, Casanova is impressed by Francesca's energy and finds himself smitten. What follows is the standard rom com format only set in the romantic baroque of Venice. \r\n</p><p>\r\nCasanova hides behind many faces and Francesca never knows his true identity until the end of the film.  With masked balls, confined fiances and nom de plume, a trail of deceit, tomfoolery and the pursuit of true love unravels.\r\n</p><p>\r\nLedger is adequate in the lead role.  His smooth accent was fine for the first few minutes but began to grate fairly quickly.  Not that Ledger will need to worry as the majority of the female audience will find his distinctive good looks and comedy timing all that was required in a pass script.  By comparison, Miller stole the show as feisty independent Francesca who despite being smarter than her female counterparts was easily duped by Casanova.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAdd to this some slapstick and camp overacting from Jeremy Irons (Kingdom of Heaven), Omid Djalili (Sky Captain) and Tim McInnerny (102 Dalmatians).\r\n</p><p>\r\nCasanova is a cross between <I>Pride & Prejudice</I>, <I>The Merchant of Venice</I> and one of a dozen British <i>"Carry On"</i> movies. </p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	248	2011-03-26
250	1	20	\N	The Fog	<p><b>The Fog</b>, another classic horror, has been remade with new pretty stars to try and chill a new generation. Sadly somewhere along the way it turned into a complete mess, despite some good acting talent and a great original movie.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe isle of Antonio harbours a dark secret. The wealth and success of the island is founded on a hideous crime committed by the town elders. When times were hard, they were approached by wealthy merchants from a leper colony looking for a new home. Instead of providing shelter, the town elders robbed the merchants and burnt their ship with all aboard.\r\n</p><p>\r\nNow, on the anniversary of the town's founding, the restless spirits of the murdered merchants have arisen from the grave to seek revenge on the isle of Antonio, assisted by a blanket of unnatural fog.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSounds good doesn't it? Sadly in an attempt to update the script and make a modern horror most of the chilling suspense has been lost to be replaced by weak acting and modern dodgy effects.\r\n</p><p>\r\nCast as the hero, although he does nothing laudable, Tom Welling (Cheaper by the Dozen 2) is Nick Castle, a pretty boy sailor hoping to look rugged by growing some rather silly stubble. I was wondering how long it'd take for the directors of this movie to manifest an excuse for Welling to lose his shirt, about 10 minutes. Sadly other than looking good Welling offers nothing to this movie and makes even less of an impact than his attractive, if disappointing, co-star, Maggie Grace (Lost [TV]).\r\n</p><p>\r\nGrace is cast as disturbed Elizabeth, a girl haunted by strange dreams of a burning ship. She returns to Antonio to find answers to her nightmares, rekindle her past relationship with Nick and mend family ties. She looks very cute and performs every horror clich including running, in only her underwear, into a spooky cloud of fog despite the growing death toll. Other than that she is as wooden as the ship she sees burning each night and evokes little sympathy as she bleats and moans about the dark past.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn fact the only semi-decent acting in the movie comes from Selma Blair (In Good Company) as radio DJ Stevie Wayne who once had a fling with Nick and is painfully slowly piecing together the connection between the dead bodies with the spooky fog that travels against the wind. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThis remake has tried to add elements of interest such as suggesting the sole survivor of the fog's first attack could in fact be the killer. We know he isn't because of the naff special effects so that story line falls flat. How about the suggestion that Nick has been unfaithful to his long absent girlfriend? Who cares, the fling is unseen and the girlfriend is annoying. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDespite the good back story this movie just could not instil any fear in the audience and fails to deliver on its description as a horror movie. The few deaths in the first half of the movie make little sense and are not scary in any way. The original had sailors being disembowelled by fish hooks or having their eyes stabbed by lances but this movie had only one 'blink and you'll miss it' stabbing and then the rest was obscured by fog. The slowly unravelling story regarding the leper ship was fairly predictable from the early flashbacks so it's drawn out discovery bores the audience. The concept of undead spirits seeking revenge on the descendants of their murderers could be scary if we cared about the descendants, but we don't so it isn't. In fact, by the end you are rooting for the ghosts to win just so the film will end.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThis remake is a dire mishap from beginning to end. The original was a bit cheesy and may seem dated but at least it had some chills and some scary moments. It did not deserve this sort of punishment. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIf you like weak remakes of once great classic horrors such as <i>'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'</i> or <i>'Dawn of the Dead'</i>, or if you just want to see a few pretty people running round in despair, this is probably good for you. Personally I'd seal it in a chest and chuck it in the sea and hope it never resurfaces.</p>\r\n	1	2011-03-26	250	2011-03-26
252	1	24	\N	Just Friends	<p>Interesting is the first word that comes into my mind when I think of this flick, very funny for sure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ryan Reynolds (The Amityville Horror) returns to his Van Wilder teen movie roots to play overweight school nerd, Chris Brander.  In school Chris has the biggest crush you could ever imagine on high school sweetheart Jamie Palamino (Amy Smart - Roadtrip).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After being ridiculed throughout high school by the popular jocks, Chris leaves his hometown to pursue a better life.  Ten years later he returns, looking slimmer than ever, as a successful businessman in the entertainment industry, very good at his job and, not to mention, famous.  In tow is hot new popstar Samantha James (Anna Faris - Scary Movie) who Chris is promoting.  Shame she is a pain in the backside and a crazy wildchild!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reluctantly, Chris and Sam have to make a stopover in his hometown while on a business trip so they go to stay with his nave mother Julie (Julie Hagerty - A Guy Thing) and his brother Mike (Chris Marquette - The Girl Next Door) who is infatuated with the wild pop starlet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After ten years away, Chris' path finally leads him back to childhood sweetheart Jamie, and he relives his teen years all over again. He gets himself in to messes and unthinkable situations in a bid to become more than 'just friends'.  But standing in his pathway to happiness is old school pal Dusty (Chris Klein - American Pie), a smug and manipulating smooth talker who is also out to win Jamie's affections.   Not only that but Chris has to beat off the unwanted affections of Samantha and palm her off on his little bro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reynolds is on top form in this comedy role, which suits him down to the ground. Smart is very cute. It's not like your everyday films where the popular girl only hangs out with the popular guys.  But Smart is outshined by Faris who adds a lot more spark and savvy to the film, as well as playing a major role in all the hilarious scenes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's a must-see movie for people who love to laugh.  Watch it if you liked The 40-year-old Virgin, Just Married and The Girl Next Door.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	252	2011-03-26
253	1	15	\N	A Cock and Bull Story	<p>Director Michael Winterbottom's (9 Songs) latest film is perhaps his most ambitious project to date in a career certainly not short of ambition. A Cock and Bull Story is a comedy of two worlds, the first being an adaptation of author Lawrence Sterne's 18th century novel <i>The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentlemen</I> and the second a fictional modern day film crew working on bringing the adaptation to the screen. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>The roles of the star Steve Coogan (Around the World in 80 Days) illustrate the film's dual storyline. Narrator Tristram Shandy (Steve Coogan) wishes to tell the audience his life story beginning with the chaotic events surrounding his birth. His mother (Keeley Hawes - Spooks [TV]) is struggling with contractions in a bedroom upstairs while his father Walter Shandy (Steve Coogan) discusses the latest medical advances with a poorly prepared doctor downstairs. Meanwhile, actor Steve Coogan (Steve Coogan) must deal with an upstart co-star (Rob Brydon), find time for his girlfriend and avoid a tabloid hack that has his hands on a story about Coogan and a night of weird sex with a stripper. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>The real world persona of Coogan is so central to the plot that A Cock and Bull Story could have quite easily come across as simply a vanity project for Steve Coogan's ego, but so willing is he to be gently ridiculed that you have to admire the actor for allowing his media image, and not an imagined character like Alan Partridge, to be the butt of all the jokes. His reaction when he discovers that the love story subplot he championed for inclusion in the film doesn't actually feature his character is priceless. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>The great and the good of British comedy all seem to crop up briefly with the likes of David Walliams (Little Britain [TV]) and Ashley Jenson (Extras [TV]) showing their faces in minor roles. So many luminaries appear that the film becomes cluttered with recognisable faces. Most of these talented actors and comedians barely make their presence felt at all, although there are several exceptions that buck this trend. The always excellent Kelly Macdonald (Gosford Park) is endearing as Coogan's neglected girlfriend Jenny, mother to his child, while Naomie Harris (28 Days Later) plays a runner attracted to Coogan who also knows far more about films in general and, Tristram Shandy in particular, than the leading man. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>The parts of the film that deal with the modern day struggles behind the camera are rather more successful than the costume drama scenes that come straight out of the pages of Tristram Shandy. Even though the onscreen novel does become rather neglected as the film goes on, there is however a nice symmetry between the two main characters, Coogan and Shandy, as they try to remain true to their intentions but are hopelessly distracted by other events. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Complex and at times bewildering but certainly worthwhile, A Cock and Bull Story certainly won't appeal to everyone, especially those who appreciate a more orthodox style of storytelling, but everyone will at least find something to laugh at in a film that proves that British comedy is still the most innovative in the world.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	253	2011-03-26
256	1	15	\N	Jarhead	<p>Jarhead, directed by Sam Mendes (American Beauty) and adapted from the novel by Anthony Swofford, has the distinction\r\nof being the first war film not to actually feature any war. Ignoring vast choreographed battle scenes, Jarhead instead \r\nlooks almost exclusively at the dull bit that all the other war films tend to cut out, the part that takes up almost all \r\nof a real soldier's time, the waiting for something to happen.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Not that Jarhead is dull, far from it. Set during the 1990/91 Gulf War we follow Private Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal - \r\nBrokeback Mountain) and the other members of his elite sniper unit as they prepare for the eventual liberation of \r\nKuwait, taking up their time talking trash, fighting among themselves and trying to maintain their sanity.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The first hour is supremely entertaining, if familiar, stuff as 'Swoff' goes about his basic training with the \r\nUnited States Marine Corps, an organisation which seems to thrive on the enforcement of petty rules and carrying \r\nout the whims of certifiable officers.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Among those making up Swofford's motley unit is Peter Sarsgaard (Flightplan) who adds another good performance to \r\nan already impressive roster of supporting roles and Jamie Foxx, who follows up his Oscar winning turn in Ray with \r\nanother confident performance as Staff Sergeant Sykes.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Before long the troops are on planes to the deserts of Saudi Arabia, all pumped up on adrenaline and full of confidence \r\nfor a fight that, for most of them, will never arrive. The scene of the men watching the helicopter assault sequence from \r\nApocalypse Now perfectly captures their attitude towards what lies ahead.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The change in tone is gradual but as time drags on the fun and games in the oppressive environment of the bleak \r\ndesert begin to have serious consequences. The knowledge that the rest of the world continues to spin while the \r\nmarines are trapped in the quagmire of sand begins to affect all the men in the unit. Swofford, whose despair \r\nis well expressed by Gyllenhaal, is particularly close to the edge by the time the fighting actually starts.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Like the soldiers forced to spend months waiting to go over the top, the audience may find the Operation Desert \r\nStorm experience disappointing. Once they do get to the front they do nothing more than bear witness to the \r\ncarnage wrought by both the enemy and their compatriots. This obviously is in keeping with the ludicrousness \r\nof the situation they have been forced to endure for months but isn't exactly what action junkies in the \r\nfront row were expecting. The oil well fires are breathtakingly rendered by the computer wizards at Industrial \r\nLight and Magic but, impressive visuals aside, there is no satisfying conclusion to be found for anyone. Perhaps \r\nthat's the point.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Released at a time when news from Iraq continues to dominate the headlines almost everyday, the film does \r\nnothing to add to political debate about the merits of going to war whether in 1990 or 2003, concerning \r\nitself instead with the much more personal experiences of young men a long way from their homes. For me, that was enough.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	256	2011-03-26
257	1	15	\N	Underworld - Evolution	<p>Arse kicking vampire warrior Selene (Kate Beckinsale - Serendipity) is back in action and back in skin tight PVC in the sequel to 2003's gothic action flick Underworld. This time our gymnastic heroine must avoid the attentions of the world's oldest vampire who is out to track her down as part of a nefarious scheme that could see the world overrun with werewolves!</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The original Underworld, despite being dire, managed to pull in enough punters to make a tidy profit and justify a bigger budget for a slicker, more shiny sequel. Underworld Evolution may well prove to be a bigger success than its predecessor; it is, after all, a better film, but it will be hampered by the fact that there is absolutely no point for anyone who doesn't have an intimate knowledge of the original to watch this movie. Everyone else will find the story completely incomprehensible. I must confess I found the first twenty minutes as impenetrable as a layer of Kevlar. Conversation about events already resolved and references about characters long since dispatched were wasted on me even with a montage of the first film and a couple of flashbacks thrown in. How this saga managed to gather so much back-story after only one film is a mystery.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The biggest disappointment about the first film was that it took an interesting idea, about a centuries old war between vampires and werewolves (known here as Lycans) and completely wasted it by having nothing but machine gun fights between chaps in minimal makeup instead of any real monster vs monster action. In Underworld Evolution the effects have certainly improved but unfortunately the plot has regressed. The war has been left on the bench and instead our heroine Selene must concern herself with preventing Marcus, the first of the Vampires, from freeing his imprisoned brother William, the first of the Werewolves.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Marcus, sometimes taking the form of a terrifying giant man-bat and sometimes an even more frightening ginger bloke (Tony Curran - Flight of the Phoenix) doesn't quite know where his brother is being held prisoner so goes about torturing a host of British thespians until he gets the answers he needs. This makes for a very violent affair, which sees heads being ripped off all over the place. Also, helping to justify the 18 certificate is a rather graphic sex scene surprisingly involving Kate Beckinsale (considering her current star status within Hollywood and her nuptial ties with director Len Wiseman) and her on screen love interest Scott Speedman (Dark Blue).</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Speedman reprises his role as Michael, the half-vampire half-Lycan hybrid whose only special abilities appear to be turning the same shade of blueberry as the girl in Charlie & the Chocolate Factory and being immortal. Exactly what being immortal entails is never quite made clear, but its usefulness is limited since it doesn't seem to guard against being shot, impaled or any number of other serious injuries. The seemingly arbitrary decisions on what does and doesn't kill characters off become a tad annoying after a while. For instance, the only difference I could discern between one particularly nasty beast managing to survive being smeared up against a cliff by a truck and dying after being cleaved into pieces by a rotor blade seemed to be the film's running time. Apparently important villains can only be dispatched when the clock is nearing the two-hour mark.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Once the tedious exposition is ditched and the film leaps from one action set piece to the next it was enjoyable in a brain dead kind of way, but I couldn't quite shake the fact that a five-minute flashback to medieval times with vampires on horsebacks charging snarling beasties was far more interesting than all the guns and girls that followed. Perhaps if a third film is made in the Underworld franchise it could take a closer look at a simpler time when villains didn't need to worry about crashing helicopters getting in the way of their dastardly plans.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	257	2011-03-26
259	1	15	\N	Fun With Dick And Jane	<p>Dick (Jim Carrey - Bruce Almighty) is a successful middle manager working for multinational behemoth Globadyne. Thinking his years of selfless hard work have finally been rewarded, Dick is promoted to the giddy heights of senior management only for the company to collapse within hours. Suddenly Dick and his wife Jane (Tea Leoni - Spanglish)  have gone from living the good life to living on the bread line while corrupt boss Jack (Alec Baldwin - Elizabethtown) has escaped the fallout with millions of dollars. Desperate for any sort of income before their house is repossessed, husband and wife decide to steal to survive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fun with Dick and Jane is a remake of a 1977 satire of the same name. The 2006 version ditches much of the satire and doesn't exactly fill it to the brim with comedy either. Jim Carrey goes through all the usual motions in his comedy repertoire, stumbling about, doing zany impressions and making strange noises. Everyone is well aware of how good Carrey is at his particular brand of hyperactive comedy, but frankly he seems a little uninspired. Perhaps the film's plot, taking on the greed, corruption and corporate mismanagement in America, isn't exactly a fertile ground for comedy but, for whatever reason, Carrey is clearly flying on autopilot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is sorely missing are a couple of great comic set pieces to hang the plot from. The robberies, which should have provided them are brief affairs and are generally wasted. Even the final heist where Dick and Jane try to steal millions of Jack's ill gotten gains from a bank right under his nose is neither tense nor particularly amusing. That isn't to say the movie doesn't have its funny moments. A mumbled conversation between the not-so-happy couple after Jane has had an allergic reaction to a Botox type drug raises a few laughs, but this is the exception and not the norm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The end credits make it abundantly clear that the target of the film's ire are real world corporations like Enron and WorldCom, companies that crashed and burned over the last few years leaving thousands of staff unemployed. Sadly the film is much too light and fluffy to land any solid punches on big business and too safe to generate any belly laughs. Only the most ardent fans of Jim Carrey will find that Fun with Dick and Jane lives up to its title.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	259	2011-03-26
260	1	20	\N	Munich	<p>In 1972 the world tuned in to watch the Munich Olympic games and instead of seeing the nations of the world unite in friendly competition, they watched in horror as 'Black September' terrorists kidnapped and killed eleven Israeli athletes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As tragic and horrifying as these events were, they were merely a prelude to the shocking retaliation by the Israeli government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest film from Steven Spielberg (War of the Worlds) follows the story of a Mossad (Israeli secret service) agent, Avner, who was hired by his government to shed his identity and go on an undercover mission to track down and assassinate all the terrorists behind the Munich kidnappings. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the beginning of his mission the line between good and evil appears clear and Avner's (Eric Bana - Troy) conscience is free of guilt. However, as the death toll rises and the terrorists' retaliation on innocent Israelis worsens, Avner's faith in his cause is rattled. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each villain he removes is replaced by someone more evil and the cycle goes on and the once clear line between good and evil begins to blur. At first he was a crusader avenging murder but before long he is as desperate as the terrorists he pursues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Munich is a very brave film. The current Middle-East crisis, undoubtedly inflamed by the events of 1972, is an ongoing saga where millions of lives hang in the balance and many people, involved in the war or distant in the west, might still remember that awful attack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film starts off with a strong attack on the terrorist movement behind the kidnappings and moves off into the story of the Israeli retaliation and its effects. The narrative follows the story of Avner and his team as they track down their targets and plan each death. Along the way Spielberg allows his characters to discuss and question the morality of their actions and makes subtle statements regarding the conduct of each side. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the events start to escalate and the fragile situation starts to fall apart, you have to question who is actually in the right? The attacks carried out by Avner and his team, and his distance from his superiors mirrors well the behaviour and organisation of the terrorist cells he targets. In addition the film makes some unsubtle comments regarding US foreign policy. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is possibly the bravest Spielberg film I have seen. As an established director and as an American Jew, Spielberg is best placed to make a film like Munich and present it to a wide audience. Even with his lofty position in Hollywood, this is still a brave movie. It may not be as horrifying as Schindler's list but it taps on a very real and present international raw nerve. The movie is shot from the perspective of a Jewish agent but does not necessarily paint a nice picture of his conduct. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In America, I would not be surprised to hear that there has been negative press from both Muslim and Jewish communities, or that Hollywood itself is concerned over the political content of the movie. Hopefully, here in the UK, we may be more receptive to this movie and less swayed by reactionary press. As to the film's sincerity, it would be silly or nave to expect any movie to paint a true picture of the numerous events following the Munich kidnappings. Even if the narrative and content is not strictly accurate, the movie presents a balanced story and, most importantly, asks questions about a very real political nightmare that is ongoing to this day. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the film, it has a good pace and uses a variety of camera styles to keep the audience in the thick of the action. The set and costume design are all realistic and the attention to detail is quite high. As an example, in one London scene, the characters stroll down a street past a poster advertising 'The Sting' (1973). Turning to the more punchy details, the special effects of the numerous bombings and shootings are very realistic, often bloody and unsettling. The effect of the brutal scenes mixed with fractured discussions and debate make for a strong overall movie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eric Bana is excellent as the agent on the edge, a family man who has been plunged into the whirlwind of international terrorism and will have to live with the demons he found there. Standing centre stage Bana gets the majority of screen time allowing the audience to share his emotional journey.  Praise must also go to Bana for perfecting a convincing Israeli/German accent, which he maintained fluently throughout the film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alongside Bana, director/actor Mathieu Kassovitz (Amelie) was a good casting for the role of a nervous Jewish bomb maker helping Avner eliminate his targets while Ciarn Hinds (Calendar Girls) has several strong scenes as Carl, a philosophical tactician helping co-ordinate each hit. Sadly Daniel Craig (The Layer Cake) is less impressive as a non-nonsense hitman and struggles with his accent throughout the film. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many may question the message behind the movie, or its sincerity to real events, but at the end of the day it's a powerful piece of work that hits you in the face. Strongly recommended for any fan of historical dramas, political thrillers, and movies such as <i>'Shindler's List'</i>, <i>'The Constant Gardener'</i> and <i>'Hotel Rwanda'</i>. </p>\r\n	5	2011-03-26	260	2011-03-26
263	1	20	\N	Walk The Line	<p>As a young 27-year-old I have little knowledge or memory of 'Johnny Cash', the American country singer and do not really like country music. After watching 'Walk The Line', I feel a greater appreciation for both Country and Mr Cash.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Raised on an Arkansas cotton farm, Johnny (Joaquin Phoenix - Ladder 49) suffered the tragic loss of his elder brother and closest friend, Jack, when he was still only a kid. His brother was well behaved and adored by his parents and after the accident, although in no way his fault, Johnny was blamed by his father for Jack's passing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This early rejection by his father would haunt Johnny for the greater part of his life. He joined the army to get away and on his return took a wife and set to work on forming a band and making it big. Luckily Johnny had a new style that caught the attention of Sun Records and before long he was on tour with Jerry Lee Lewis and his childhood crush, June Carter (Reese Witherspoon - Just Like Heaven).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the tour circuit took its toll and Johnny's fame increased, he started to take drugs to help keep him going. Before long he was an addict and not only to the drugs but to life on tour. His feelings for June Carter kept growing and his wife grew more distant, then it all went wrong. Johnny spiralled into a drug fuelled descent and ended up a wasted wreck living in a motel. His wife had left him and June would not return his calls. Something had to change or Johnny was gonna wind up dead in a gutter. It was at his lowest when June returned and helped Johnny turn his life around, kick his habit and get back to work. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with any biopic, Walk The Line tries to cram a whole life into a couple of hours. After spending a short while following Johnny's childhood in Arkansas, the film suddenly starts to leap years ahead and feels a little rushed. Thankfully the pace settles and before long you feel like you are on tour with the Man in Black.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some may be saying to themselves 'another biopic of a great legend who fell from grace and managed to clean up, come back, and earn a place in history'. I will not deny that this movie does tread the familiar biopic route. What sets it apart from many of its peers is the acting of the two lead roles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The life of Johnny Cash had ups and downs and was tainted by a long and painful addiction to amphetamines. Phoenix lost his own brother to drugs and it was recently reported that he himself has had a bit of bother with the bottle. In acting the part of Johnny Cash, Phoenix must have tapped into feelings and emotions close to his soul, and faced his own demons. On top of the acting duties, Phoenix had a second challenge. As Johnny Cash he had to not only act the life of a man whose memory still burns in the hearts of many fans, but also learn to sing and play like the man himself. The film is full of songs and so there was no escape for Phoenix if he couldn't get the voice right. Both the acting and singing was spot on and Phoenix well deserves his Oscar nomination for best actor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After so much praise I must stop and burst the bubble for Mr Phoenix. As great as his performance was, he was outshone by Witherspoon as June Carter. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alongside Johnny Cash's fall from grace we watch the slowly unfolding story of June Carter. A divorcee when she met Johnny Cash, June was a childhood star who had been through a bad break up with her ex-husband. On tour she received mixed reviews from fans, many of which being strict Christians opposed the concept of divorce. If it was being the only girl on the tour or her divorce, June was a strong willed and sincere woman who could be happy and funny for her audience while inside she was in pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Johnny Cash fell on hard times, and when his family had abandoned him, it was June Carter who picked him up and helped him through his nightmares. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Witherspoon also puts in a superb singing performance following months of voice and autoharp lessons but it is impressive nonetheless considering she has never sung before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Witherspoon was amazing as June Carter. With most of her roles being in romantic comedies or teen movies, Walk The Line was a departure from the usual stereotype and she stole every scene. Again, she deserves her Oscar Nomination for best actress and I wish her every success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, Walk The Line is a moving account of two famous singers who eventually find peace together. The film's few faults rest with a rushed history in the first half and the movie's similarities to other recent and notable musical biopic such as <i>Ray</i> and <i>Beyond the Sea</i>. Regardless of these minor quibbles it is a great film and deserves praise.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	4	2011-03-26	263	2011-03-26
268	1	12	\N	Good Night, and Good Luck	<p>In 1950, Senator Joseph McCarthy, chairman of the House Un-American Activities Committee, began a campaign against Communists living in the USA. For the next two years, he investigated various government departments and questioned individuals in closed-room hearings, encouraging those with former left-wing ties to denounce others in order to prove their allegiance to the US.</p><p>\r\n\r\nMany did not agree with McCarthy's methods, but few were willing to make a stand against him because they feared that he would also denounce them for having Communist ties. The Columbia Broadcasting Service news team of "See It Now", anchored by legendary journalist Edward R. Murrow, decided that someone had to oppose McCarthy and speak up for the civil rights of those who stood accused. They produced a series of television documentaries that openly criticised McCarthy and served to swing public opinion against McCarthy, and perhaps even contributed to his political downfall. This is their story.</p><p>\r\n\r\nThough an excellent film, there is not a great deal that can be said about <i>Good Night, And Good Luck</i>. Filmed in black and white for authenticity, this is a simple, unadorned film that relies on three key components: a strong cast, minimalist direction and a powerful story, one that is very timely.</p><p>\r\n\r\nSet almost entirely in the offices and production studios of CBS, the focus is on the men of "See It Now", their decisions and their actions in their response to the paranoia instilled within America by Senator McCarthy. Other than a few brief interludes, the politics of the situation is the only concern of the film. This is almost overwhelming, but in some ways the story demands it. There are no tangents or unnecessary distractions, there is just a straight \r\ndepiction of important real-life events about the abuse of political power and the responsibilities of the media.</p><p>\r\n\r\nOstensibly an ensemble film, the movie is dominated by David Strathairn (The Sopranos [TV]) as the iconic Murrow in an Oscar worthy performance. George Clooney supports as "See It Now"'s producer, Fred Friendly but it is clear that he made the right decision in letting Strathairn play the lead. Clooney's other casting decision, to use archive footage in place of an actor playing the role of McCarthy, seems strange, and at first the discontinuity between the film and the archive footage of McCarthy is quite stark. Gradually this becomes less immediate, and what it serves to do is to create a sense of concrete reality. McCarthy was so forceful, so over the top, that any attempt to bring him to life would have resulted in his actor being charged with flagrant scenery mastication. A stroke of genius then, to use McCarthy himself in the film. It hammers the point home; this really happened.</p><p>\r\n\r\nTo sum up, this is a film that should be seen because it is well-made, the acting is uniformly excellent, and because it is that rarest of Hollywood beasts, a film with an important message conveyed without resorting to extremes. Clooney is a brave man to make such a politically charged film, but this is only one of a series of films (such as <i>Syriana</i>, which incidentally also features George Clooney) that are daring to be critical of the current political \r\nclimate in the US. I'm going to finish with a quote from Murrow, one that sums up the film perfectly, a point that is as relevant today as it was over 50 years ago.</p><p>\r\n\r\n<i>"...As a nation we have come into our full inheritance at a tender age. We proclaim ourselves, as indeed we are, the defenders of freedom, wherever it continues to exist in the world, but we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home"</i></p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	268	2011-03-26
270	1	12	\N	A Bittersweet Life	<p>As an enforcer for the Hotel Crown, Sunwoo (Lee Byung-hun - <i>Joint Security Area</i>) leads a stable, if unemotional life. He is favoured by his employer, the crime boss President Kang, and so is given the job of looking after Kang's young girlfriend when Kang makes a business trip abroad. But the brief contact with Heesoo awakens Sunwoo's dormant emotions, and leads him to make a small but devastating mistake that sends his life spiralling out of control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over his career, writer/director Kim Jee-woon has expressed no genre preference, covering black comedy, sports and psychological horror in his three previous films, and now noirish thriller in <i>A Bittersweet\r\nLife</i>. This jack-of-all-trades approach is risky, but Kim hadn't missed a step in the past and he almost manages it again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's a characteristic of Asian cinema to throw a mix of disparate elements together and hope it all sticks together coherently. This mix usually takes the form of slapstick or comic-book violence inserted into a serious drama, and in films such as <i>Oldboy</i> and <i>Zatoichi</i> it works. In <i>A Bittersweet Life</i>, Kim misjudges the balancing act required and fatally undermines the film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first half of the film is the obligatory set-up, a slow and increasingly tense series of events during which it becomes clear that Sunwoo will engineer his own destruction. However, the film fails to capitalise on this promising start and goes off the boil after Sunwoo's fall from grace in a series of absurd scenes. The showdown between Sunwoo and his former employer is well choreographed but one can't help but laugh at the ludicrous amount of blood spurting all over the place during the supposedly moving climax. Takeshi Kitano made a deliberate choice to use excessive CG blood in\r\n<i>Zatoichi</i> to highlight the film's unreality and it worked as intended. Kim's use of excessive fake blood goes beyond unreality into farce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere the film is gritty and realistic, and some of the humour does actually work. In one scene, Sunwoo is trying to acquire a gun and finds himself racing to assemble a gun before the gunrunner sat opposite him since no other guns are to hand. Then he wastes an entire clip of bullets trying to kill a fleeing man because he's simply not a good shot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a technical perspective, the film is close to flawless, exhibiting the distinctive visual style seen in <i>A Tale Of Two Sisters</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The acting is excellent as well, Lee Byung-hun carrying the film as required and generally eclipsing his supporting actors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if comparisons with <i>A Tale Of Two Sisters</i> or Kim's previous films are avoided, <i>A Bittersweet Life</i> remains a disappointing film on its own terms. It is somehow more frustrating that the film's flaws all arise from conscious decisions on the part of the director. I'm sure that Kim's next film will again be completely different to his previous work, and though it'll be interesting to see what genre he tackles in the future I just hope that it is a better effort than that seen here.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n	3	2011-03-26	270	2011-03-26
271	1	12	\N	Lady Vengeance	<p>As a high-school girl, Lee Geum-Ja (Lee Yeong-ae - <i>Joint Security Area</i>) is wrongfully jailed for the shocking abduction and murder of a child. After thirteen years as a model prisoner, she is released back into the world and begins to gather together her fellow ex-convicts in an elaborate revenge against the man who put her in prison, Mr Baek (Choi Min-sik - <i>Oldboy</i>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of all the Korean directors who have come to prominence outside of their home country in recent years, Park is the most adept at creating stylish and entertaining films that bridge the often gaping abyss between art-house and popcorn cinema. Following <i>Sympathy For Mr Vengeance</i> and <i>Oldboy</i>, <i>Lady Vengeance</i> forms the third and final part of his revenge trilogy, and is another confidently directed effort that examines the idea of using violence as a means to achieve redemption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Park has said that this film was made as a reaction to the previous parts of the trilogy, a combination of the two distinct styles used, along with a female lead to try and make up for his dissatisfaction with the female characters in his earlier films. And so on first viewing, these differences are palpable and may even cause dissatisfaction. The violence shown is not explicit, often taking place off-camera, and the revenge aspect is less elaborate than one might expect, despite taking place over a long period of time. It is also different in nature, planned by a single person but achieved by collaboration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Lady Vengeance</i> is about the transformation of Geum-ja, from shining angel of innocence to cold demon of retribution. This emotional journey is torturous and soul-destroying, and Lee Yeong-ae carries a role that blows away public perception of her as a dainty innocent from her Korean television days. As the villain and supporting actor of the piece, Choi Min-sik as Mr Baek almost steals the film from under Lee Yeong-ae's nose, but in the end this is her film and she gives a superb performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As always with Park's films, <i>Lady Vengeance</i> is beautifully shot but is a stylistic advance on what has come before, with creative transitions between scenes and a visual style that is reminiscent of <i>Amelie</i>. No, really. When you consider the subject of both films, the comparison seems insane but they have a lot in common, which leads me to speculate on how a romantic comedy directed by Park would look...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, on the face of things, this film is more of a black comedy than a revenge drama. Throughout are little touches of wry humour (also a little <i>Amelie</i>-esque), leading up to the final confrontation between Geum-ja and Mr Baek which is absolutely hilarious. This does detract a little from the pathos of the final scene, but not to the same degree as <i>A Bittersweet Life</i>, and the conflicting emotional response to the film works. You'll find yourself disturbed, horrified, and amused during the film and at several stages it might be a case of all three at the same time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only minor criticism that can be levelled at the film is that it does go on for fractionally too long. Also, the scene featuring Geum-ja, her daughter and Mr Baek falls a little flat simply because of translation issues. Geum-ja explains in Korean why she has to kill Mr Baek, and Mr Baek is forced at gun-point to translate into English for her daughter's benefit. It was more the repetition of the words, first as sub-titles for Geum-ja and then as spoken English from Mr Baek, that made the scene drag on, but also the feeling that Korean-speaking members of the audience were being treated to a joke that was flying over the heads of everyone else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the vengeance scale, it's not as good as <i>Oldboy</i> but that is simply a reflection of how highly I regard that film. Though it features a woman out for revenge against a man who has wronged her, this is no <i>Kill Bill</i> and for that we should all be thankful. There are no gun-fights, kung-fu brawls, explosions nor is there excessive dialogue and a complete lack of restraint. This is another stunning and thought-provoking film from the mind of Park Chan-wook, and is an excellent example of the current crop of high quality Korean cinema that is putting other Asian and Hollywood fare to shame.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	271	2011-03-26
273	1	15	\N	Shooting Dogs	<p>In 1994, the world turned its back as Rwanda descended into genocide. Despite the United Nation's troops already in position on the ground acting as monitors, the international community decided to pull their forces out as the Hutu turned on their Tutsi neighbours. Over the course of 100 days more than half a million people were slaughtered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shooting Dogs tells the true story of the massacre at the Ecole Technique Officielle, a school where roughly 2,500 people took refuge behind the guns of UN troops only for those soldiers to pull out and the machete wielding Hutu's to move in for the kill. The filmmakers add to this situation two fictional characters, both of them white, and examine how they react to the carnage. Father Christopher (John Hurt - The Skeleton Key) must decide whether to stay with his flock and idealistic young teacher Joe (Hugh Dancy - King Arthur) faces an impossible choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film takes its name from the moment the UN troops decide to open fire on the stray dogs roaming outside the compound that are feeding on the bodies of the dead. The officer points out sincerely that the animals pose a health threat to the refugees trapped inside. Father Christopher asks angrily why they are unwilling to take similar action over the other, more pressing, threat to refugees' health, the horde of extremist militia waiting outside the compound to begin the slaughter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Captain Delon (Dominique Horwitz) is surprisingly sympathetic as the commander of the Belgian UN contingent at the school, a man with the means to prevent the inevitable but unable to act. His hands are tied by the orders given by superiors unwilling to become embroiled in an African problem. The situation is bleak enough that even the most upstanding characters are sullied by the events going on around them, either by the actions they take or those they fail to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While <i>Hotel Rwanda</i>, which was also set during the events of 1994, was to some extent sanitised from some of the worst aspects of the civil war, Shooting Dogs exposes its audience to everything. To describe this film as harrowing doesn't do the violence portrayed on screen justice. The events as they are filmed are not actually particularly bloody but the knowledge that the actions are firmly rooted in fact gives each swing of the machete a far greater impact. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The decision to shoot the movie at the sight of the real massacre at the Ecole Technique Officielle as well as using survivors as extras does much to add to the palpable atmosphere emanating from the screen. Audiences will find it difficult to tear their eyes from the screen as the situation inexorably deteriorates into despair and then finally death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the events at the time were largely ignored by the international community and media, films such as this and last year's <i>Hotel Rwanda</i> are now highlighting the stories of those who lived and died during the hundred days of genocide. I can highly recommend watching this film but do not go in expecting a night's comfortable viewing; Shooting Dogs was an experience that stayed with me long after I had left the cinema.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	273	2011-03-26
274	1	16	\N	The Ringer	<p>Steve Barker (Johnny Knoxville - The Dukes of Hazzard) is fed up of his mundane and uninspiring office job and decides to plead for a promotion or new challenge. Instead, he is given more responsibility and is ordered to fire the company's faithful and hard working caretaker Stavi (Luis Avalos - Hollywood Homicide).\r\n</p><p>\r\nSteve doesn't have the heart to do it and instead employs Stavi as his personal gardener. However, disaster strikes when Stavi gets injured on the job and Steve is left to foot the bill for his medical expenses.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn a harebrained scheme, Steve and his uncle Gary (Brian Cox - Red Eye) decide to come up with a foolproof but outrageous scheme to fix the Special Olympics to raise some quick cash.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSteve reluctantly agrees and takes on the persona of Jeffy, an athlete with learning difficulties. Meanwhile, Gary has his own agenda and hopes to win the money to clear a large unpaid debt. He tricks his debtors into backing top athlete Jimmy (Leonard Flowers) while he is secretly confident of Steve's ability to win the games.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWhen Steve first joins the games, he meets cute and kind volunteer Lynn (Katherine Heigl - Side Effects) who he immediately has a crush on but she cannot discover his true identity and background. He also battles with convincing his fellow athletes of his authenticity as an athlete and he fails to fit in straightaway.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSooner or later, Steve and his competitors start to come to a mutual understanding and their friendship starts to grow. His fellow athletes are behind him 100% and are determined to see him beat six-time Gold Medal champion Jimmy once and for all.\r\n</p><p>\r\nKnoxville is on top form as the comedic lead but with good support from Edward Barbanell and Bill Chott (Saturday Night Live [TV]) who centre the funniest scenes.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBefore watching the film, I was concerned by its subject matter and how it would portray people with learning difficulties and physical disabilities, especially since the Farrelly Brothers are renowned for putting a comical slapstick spin on minority groups such as in Stuck On You, Shallow Hal and There's Something About Mary. However, my concerns were dispelled as most of the comedy centres around Knoxville's character and his inadequacies while his fellow athletes excel far above him.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	274	2011-03-26

276	1	20	\N	Lucky Number Slevin	<p>If <i>'Lucky Number Slevin'</i> had been made by Guy Ritchie and titled <i>'Revolver'</i>, it would have been a great film, but for that very reason, it isn't a great film. Confused, well that's a good thing.\r\n</p><p>\r\nScottish director Paul McGuigan (Wicker Park) has made a gangster comedy very reminiscent of <i>'Lock Stock...'</i> and <i>'Snatch'</i> but given the movie a very strong American feel. This is both good and bad.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAmerican films do not always embrace the idea of irony, although they certainly are capable of it. Sadly the very format that made the Guy Ritchie movies so great had become tired and a Hollywood revamp is either too early or feels misplaced. Also, the film doesn't allow the audience much chance to work things out for themselves.\r\n</p><p>\r\nI can't list the Hollywood clichs here without ruining the film for you and as I always try to avoid plot spoilers (huh, irony again), I have said enough already. Needless to say some of the many twists are foreseeable or before you are allowed a chance to get confused, a character reviews key story points so that you know what is going on.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSo what am I trying to say? I am trying to pay compliments to a great gangster comedy but also highlight some weaknesses without giving too much away.\r\n</p><p>\r\nJosh Hartnett (Sin City) plays Slevin, an unlucky guy who gets mistaken for his friend who is heavily in debt to two rival mobs. Dragged before 'The Boss' (Morgan Freeman - Batman Begins), Slevin is given the option to cancel his debt in exchange for murdering the son of a rival mob boss, The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley - Oliver Twist). Shortly afterwards he is dragged before the Rabbi to cancel another dept, this time it's a gambling debt of $33,000 to be paid within 48 hours.\r\n</p><p>\r\nCaught between the two mobs and with no sign of his friend, the man in debt, he has to find a way to stay alive and appease both mobs. This may not be so easy with super cool assassin 'Good Cat' (Bruce Willis - Sin City) knocking off people all around him and also an inquisitive cop (Stanley Tucci - Shall We Dance) who has been watching each mob for years. Luckily he has one ally, a bouncy morgue attendant named Lindsey (Lucy Lui - Domino) who lives across the hall and has growing feelings for our hero.\r\n</p><p>\r\nJosh Hartnett is on top form displaying comedy and charisma as his character is bounced between bad situations and ruthless people. Considering some of the heavyweight actors in this movie, he plays well and this could be a career highlight. Lucy Lui is fun and adds light to the dark story and a dash of romance. True, being the only female cast member she has little to compete against but she does bring energy and hope for the hero and remains as cute and sexy as ever.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBen Kingsley and Morgan Freeman add gravitas as the rival mob bosses each with a dash of wit mixed in with a large amount of menace and Bruce Willis is as cool as ever as the elusive 'Good Cat', dispatching people 'Leon' style. These three darker characters balance out well and Willis' sharp ruthless assassin makes up for his naff turn in the distant but not forgotten 'The Jackal' (a crime few can pardon but shouldn't be burdened on one man).\r\n</p><p>\r\nLucky Number Slevin is an entertaining film and a good attempt at a comedy gangster movie. The script, sets, characters, acting and humour are all great but sadly this is a film we have seen before. It's an amalgam of many different films and, while the overall package is great, the movie loses marks for unoriginality.\r\n</p><p>\r\nStrongly recommended for fans of the Guy Ritchie movies, gangster movies, assassin movies, or for fans of any of the principal actors.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	276	2011-03-26
277	1	20	\N	Syriana	<p>From the writer of Crash comes a politically charged story centring on the US policy within the Middle East focusing primarily on the oil industry. Filmed in a similar style to Crash, Syriana has multiple story threads, of which each explores a particular aspect of the oil industry and these stories occasionally intersect.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe various threads surround a battle for succession in an unnamed Middle Eastern state run by an elderly Sheik. The wealthy Sheik has two sons. The elder, Nasir (Alexander Siddig - Kingdom of Heaven), is a reformer who hopes to rebuild his country's fragile economy and bring stability to the region, while the younger son, Meshal (Akbar Kurtha - Holby City [TV]), is more easily seduced by western influences. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhichever son inherits the land will inherit the oil, and the wealthy American companies that rely on that oil will do anything to tip the balance in their favour.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe various stories follow a CIA agent who is unknowingly manipulated by big business to tip the balance occasionally; a young Muslim boy who is lured into a radical terrorist group; an American financial expert who is seduced by the wealth and potential of a career with Nasir; and a lawyer in Washington who is getting into the nitty-gritty of legalising a multi billion dollar merger between two oil companies. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSadly unlike <i>'Crash'</i>, the multiple threads in 'Syriana' are slow to develop and never truly engage the audience. Considering the current trend for thought provoking films that challenge the powers that be, this is actually rather disappointing considering the subject's potential. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSyriana gathered considerable hype prior to its release in the UK and following the thankful success of films such as <i>'Good Night, and Good Luck'</i>, <i>'The Constant Gardner'</i>, <i>'Hotel Rwanda'</i> and the upcoming <i>'Shooting Dogs'</i>, I was hoping for something gritty and thought provoking. Sadly my only thought was 'my arse is getting numb' and I have other films I need to review.\r\n</p><p>\r\nTurning now to the acting, you may recall that George Clooney won best supporting actor his role as an aging CIA field agent in Syriana. Having watched the film this was almost certainly a 'sympathy vote' for not winning best director for the recent 'Good Night, and Good Luck'. \r\n</p><p>\r\nOther notable but lacklustre performances come from Matt Damon (The Brothers Grimm) as a grieving father who is easily won over by the potential for money and influence over Nasir, and Christopher Plummer (Must Love Dogs) as his usual intelligent, yet corrupt, puppet master who tries to manipulate the younger impressionable Meshal. In fact I feel the best performances in this movie come from the lesser known actors such as Alexander Siddig as Nasir, the forthright man hoping to build a better world and Amanda Peet (A Lot Like Love) as the loving wife grieving her lost son and losing her husband.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFilms like <i>'Crash'</i>, <i>'Munich'</i> and <i>'The Constant Gardner'</i> do not offer the masses a story on a plate. Instead they ask the audience to think about larger issues affecting the world today, a good thing. Syriana is another movie following this trend but somehow it didn't connect with me as much as the others. A potentially great but ultimately dull political movie akin to the above and recommended for fans of intelligent cinema who need to escape the usual banal Hollywood popcorn.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	277	2011-03-26
278	1	12	\N	The Worlds Fastest Indian	<p>In the 1960s, a New Zealander by the name of Burt Munro followed his dream of taking part in the Speed Week near Salt Lake City in Utah. Modifying his Indian Scout motorbike with whatever materials he had to hand, Munro took himself and his bike from the small island of Invercargill all the way to the Bonneville Salt Flats where he set a series of world speed records, one of which he still holds to this day. This is the true story of a man who was determined to achieve his life- long ambition and did so in style.\r\n</p><p>\r\nNo offence intended, but land speed record setting isn't exactly the most riveting of subjects. The lack of tension provided by other participants competing at the same time removes it from the world of (interesting) spectator sports in my opinion, so my initial expectation for this film was low. Happily enough, I was soon disavowed of my baseless assumption by this entertaining and touching film.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThis film isn't about just one man chasing his dream; writer/director Roger Donaldson has wanted to tell the story of Burt Munro for over 30 years. Donaldson met Munro at the start of his filmmaking career and made a short documentary about the man from Invercargill, but he always felt that he hadn't done Munro justice. Upon watching this film, it becomes evident that very little could have done justice to such a fascinating man. Munro was a charming, determined, eccentric\r\nKiwi whose larger-than-life persona and all-consuming passion for moving very fast on pieces of metal, plastic and rubber held together by double-backed sticky tape are all the more surprising for being real.\r\n</p><p>\r\nA character-driven film lives or dies by the quality of its actors, and Donaldson was blessed in securing the talents of the man formerly known as Sir Anthony Hopkins (Proof) for the lead role. Hopkins is in fine form as the quirky Kiwi, and seems to revel in the opportunity to play a character other than a psychopathic serial killer. There is good support from a wide variety of people, ranging from proper New Zealanders for the first half of the film on Invercargill, to the various Americans Munro meets on his road trip from California to Utah. Some of the events that occur during the film are wildly improbable (and it could be said that Munro's angina had more to do with his sex drive than his speeding), but this all really happened!\r\n</p><p>\r\n<i>The World's Fastest Indian</i> is an uplifting and inspirational film for all ages, with a mix of drama, humour, romance and a few thrills to provide something for everyone. The two-hour running time may be of some concern to those with a short attention span or no bladder control, but other than that there is little to criticise. Reality dictates that a feel-good film made outside of Hollywood must sink without trace, so it is my duty as a member of the Right-Headed\r\nFilm Appreciation Society to exhort you to go and watch this film, and to follow your dreams with the words of Munro in mind:\r\n</p><p>\r\n<i>"If it's hard, work harder; if it's impossible, work harder still. Give it whatever it takes, but do it."</i></p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	278	2011-03-26
265	1	15	Blah	Derailed	<p>Adapted from the book by James Siegel, Derailed sees stressed out married man Charles (Clive Owen - Closer) take a welcome break from his distant wife and caring for his sick daughter by flirting with fellow train passenger Lucinda (Jennifer Aniston - Rumor Has It) on the way into work. A drink at a bar swiftly leads back to a sleazy motel room, but just as Charles is about to consummate his affair a gunman bursts into the room and steals his wallet but not before dealing out a pistol whipping and raping Lucinda.</p><p>\r\n\r\nCharles nurses his bruises and goes back to his settled family life but the robber has no intention of letting him forget his dalliance and begins a campaign of blackmail. Charles is faced with the stark choice of paying up money saved for some desperately needed treatment for his child or come clean and risk losing everything he loves. </p><p>\r\n\r\nStories in which a normally respectable person's world spirals out of control after they lose control of the events taking place around them usually have me hooked but Derailed, while competently made, never ignites to make the movie an edge of the seat experience. </p><p>\r\n\r\nPart of the problem is the performances of the central actors. Aniston acts as if stuck in some sort of trance, her face failing to betray even a hint of emotion. Perhaps I spent too many years watching her lounge around Central Perk as Rachel but I wasn't very convinced by her "smouldering vixen on the train" routine. Luckily for her, and the film's credibility as a thriller, her character doesn't actually get all that much screen time.</p><p>\r\n\r\nInstead the burden of carrying much of the film falls to leading man Clive Owen. The role of Charles doesn't exactly stretch him as an actor but at least Owen injects enough sleaze into the character to make him more than a typically bland heroic stereotype. In fact he plays so fast and loose with the cash upon which his daughter's future depends that the audience can never completely route for him to escape his predicament. Still Owen doesn't do any damage to his credibility and his career can march on through this mostly forgettable excursion.</p><p>\r\n\r\nWhile the two leads aren't having their best days, the real star of the show turns out to be Vincent Cassel's (Ocean's Twelve) menacing French villain La Roche. He has his finest moment when he connives his way into Charles's family home and chats with his unsuspecting wife while his victim stands by powerless to intervene. He is some what less convincing when he is required to beat up Charles since Owen is clearly a big muscular guy and Cassel, frankly, isn't. He should have left the tough guy work to his henchman played by rapper Xzibit (MTV's Pimp My Ride [TV]).</p><p>\r\n\r\nWhat really lets the film down is a plot, which isn't nearly as clever as it presumably thinks it is. The principal twist can be seen approaching from a very long way down the track which drains the film of a lot of its tension. Even at the very end when it appears that the film may have something unexpected hidden up its sleeve, a completely underwhelming revelation arrives to confirm that this is destined for late night television, the sort of film that starts just after most people have gone to bed.</p>\r\n\r\n	2	2011-03-26	265	2012-03-08

298	1	15	\N	Mission Impossible 3	<p>After the painfully inept second installment of the Mission Impossible series, I doubt many people were counting down the days until they could witness the further adventures of Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise - War of the Worlds) and the IMF. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWithout Tom Cruise's determination that the project went into production it seems unlikely that this third episode would have been made. The franchise could not survive another misstep on the scale of John Woo's 'style over substance' outing so handing a project of this size and complexity to a first time director only known for his work on television represented a considerable risk. \r\n</p><p>\r\nCruise decided that J. J. Abrams was the right man for the job after watching an episode of Abrams' small screen spy thriller <i>Alias</i>. The decision was a smart one and Abrams' efforts leave the series on a far firmer footing than he found it on. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe film's principal innovation is to inject some personality into Ethan Hunt's usually steely-eyed persona. Having retired from field operations, he now simply trains the next generation of super spies rather than undertaking the missions himself. He has a beautiful fiance waiting for him at home and an eager young protg hoping to follow in his footsteps at work. \r\n</p><p>\r\nBefore he can settle down to happy matrimony, however, the protg (Keri Russell - The Upside of Anger) disappears on a job and the finger of suspicion points to international arms dealer Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman - Capote). Hunt is back in action but crossing swords with Davian may put his unsuspecting girlfriend at risk. \r\n</p><p>\r\nUnlike its predecessors, the film immediately realises that Hunt is supposed to be working for a vast government organisation along the lines of the CIA and decides to bring this framework into play. \r\n</p><p>\r\nHunt isn't the one man army of Mission Impossible II and is instead surrounded by a team of operatives much like the ones who were mercilessly wiped out in the first ten minutes of Brian De Palma's original movie. These characters are portrayed by a string of talented actors including Jonathan Rhys Meyers (Matchpoint), Lawrence Fishburne (Assault on Precinct 13) and the returning Ving Rhames (Dawn of the Dead). \r\n</p><p>\r\nBy introducing so many people into the mix, however, some are understandably neglected. Rhys Meyers gets almost nothing to do but sit in the van, although Fishburne makes the most of his scenes as Hunt's disapproving boss. Hoffman, fresh from his Oscar winning work in Capote, gives a cool performance as the principal villain. Although he doesn't look a physical match for Cruise during a rough and tumble punch-up finale, he certainly impresses during two interrogation scenes where Davian runs rings around a bewildered Hunt. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe pick of the action sequences has to be the night-time helicopter pursuit through an enormous wind farm, a chase which is further complicated by Hunt's frantic attempts to save the life of a dying friend in the back of the chopper. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAs superficially impressive as the film is, it suffers from a lack of humour and a wafer thin plot. Unlike the absurdly complex original, in this film everything simply revolves around Davian. Saving the girl from him in Berlin, capturing him in Rome and saving the other girl from him in Shanghai. It isn't groundbreaking stuff but the filmmakers believe that the single thread introduced at the film's start, that Davian will harm the woman Hunt loves, is enough to carry the story forward. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSadly it isn't because Hunt's relationship with Julia (Michelle Monaghan - Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) isn't given the screen time necessary to make the audience care about her fate. As a result the film feels more like a series of small adventures in exotic locations rather than a single cohesive experience. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAs the first big studio release of the summer Mission Impossible III doesn't disappoint but, probably like many of the other high profile films that will follow it in the coming months, it doesn't entirely satisfy either.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	298	2011-03-26

285	1	4	\N	Imagine Me and You	<p>Have you ever locked eyes with a complete stranger and felt like you've known them all your life? Well, that's what happens in this new British rom-com. Following a love story about two people that are destined to be together would be all well and good if it weren't for the tangled web of a love quadrangle. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWith more complications than a knitting pattern, when Rachel (Piper Perabo - The Cave) and Luce's (Lena Headey - The Brothers Grimm) eyes meet across a crowded wedding, that one look seals their fate. Unfortunately it's Rachel's wedding, to her long-term boyfriend, Heck (Matthew Goode - Match Point), who she loves deeply and knows inside out, while Luce is the florist delivering the flowers for her big day. Add into the mix one playa, Cooper (Darren Boyd - Smack the Pony [TV]) trying his luck, and thus ensues a delightfully funny 90 minutes.\r\n</p><p>\r\nRegardless of the fact that they decide to become "just friends", as their friendship develops Rachel becomes more emotionally distant from the lovely Heck until she has to take stock of exactly what she wants.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOne poignant moment, which almost made me, a "grown woman cry", was a scene on top of their roof between Heck and Rachel's little sister, Beth (Sharon Horgan) where the two characters engage the audience in a heart-to-heart reflection on life.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBut before all you guys get a little excited about the thought of girl-on-girl action, screenwriter Ol Parker approaches the subject of true love, with such passion, and is not offensive or pushes the boundaries when broaching the subject of gay love.\r\n</p><p>\r\nEven though I break into song every time I hear the title, the pen of Parker has managed to make you truly fall in love with all the characters.  Even Coop, whose chauvinistic comments end up being endearing, and Heck who you'd think you'd want to slap for being wet, comes across more as a sweet, sympathetic guy and is fortunate enough to have some of the film's best one-liners.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThis film attracts all audiences, as it is not about being gay, and I doubt it will become an iconic "coming-out" film with a huge gay following - it is just a story about true love, regardless of sex and orientation.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIf you liked warm romantic British films such as <i>Love Actually</i> and <i>Notting Hill</i>, then I'm sure you'll like this. It gives you hope, and it's nice to know that for all their bravado, there are still many guys out there who are not emotional cripples.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	285	2011-03-26
279	1	20	\N	The Pink Panther	<p>\r\nAfter decades resting peacefully in the land of comedy classics, The Pink Panther has been dragged back into the movie machine for a modern reworking. \r\n</p><p>\r\nFor those of you too young to remember, and probably the target audience, The Pink Panther is the name of a fantastic pink diamond, so named because of a small fault within the gem resembling a leaping panther. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIn the original Pink Panther movies, a series of great thieves stole the famous stone and each time the seemingly incompetent Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers) would track down the culprit and save the day. The world's worst detective was brought to life by the comic genius of Peter Sellers in four classic films.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAlas, in the intervening years, the great Peter Sellers passed away so the brilliant minds behind this latest incarnation had to find a new comedian to fill the shoes of the legendary Inspector Clouseau. They chose Steve Martin... why?\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn this latest movie the manager of the French football team has been murdered in front of a packed stadium and his fabulous bling bling ring, containing the humungous Pink Panther diamond, has been stolen. Ambitious Chief Inspector Dreyfuss (Kevin Kline - De Lovely) hungrily seeks an award for service to France but fears that he may not find the culprit in time so as a diversion appoints the French police force's worst detective, Clouseau, to find the murderer. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhile Clouseau and his assistant Ponton (Jean Reno - The Da Vinci Code) fumbles around trying to apprehend the murderer, Dreyfuss assembles a team of the finest detectives in the hope of finding the murderer himself and claiming credit for the arrest and, of course, his coveted award. If his team fails, Clouseau is the official detective on the case and he will carry the blame. A plan almost as flawless as the Pink Panther diamond itself, in other words, flawed.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe list of suspects includes the delicious girlfriend of the deceased, Xania (Beyonce Knowles - Austin Powers: Goldmember), an unscrupulous casino owner named Larocque (Roger Rees - The West Wing [TV]) and a disgruntled football star, Bizu (William Abadie - Sex and the City [TV]). \r\n</p><p>\r\nAs Clouseau stumbles from one embarrassment to another joined together by limp jokes and predictable slapstick, we no longer care if he succeeds or not and sympathise with the football manager who died in the first scene.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWhy, what and where? Why did they decide to remake The Pink Panther, what were they thinking when they employed Steve Martin, and where did all the humour go? There are some classic slapstick moments and a few good lines but most of the time the jokes felt tired or fell flat.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMartin's ridiculous French accent, itself a joke in the original, is plain irritating in this movie. As if to emphasise this flat joke, there is a protracted scene where Clouseau tries in vain to learn how to order a hamburger in a realistic American accent. As the scene dragged on, what was vaguely humourous quickly became boring and eventually irritating, it then moved on to a point where I wanted to disconnect my TV and throw it into a river.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSteve Martin can, on occasion, be a great comedian. Films such as 'All of me', 'The Jerk', 'Father of the Bride' and 'Parenthood', suit his combination of physical comedy and over zealous mannerisms. However, when considering who to cast in a role so tightly linked to a former great such as Peter Sellers or Phil Silvers, Martin is fundamentally mismatched. Did nobody learn from the weak 'Sgt. Bilko' remake?\r\n</p><p>\r\nDragged down by the central performance, Reno looked misplaced at the best of times and his occasional violent attacks upon Clouseau were welcomed. Knowles managed to come off lightly by only appearing in a few scenes while Kline, another great comedian who out performed Martin 2 to 1, could not save this film. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhere did the humour go? Somewhere nice I hope where Peter Sellers can relax with a cool drink fanned by beautiful women.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThis film is recommended for early teens and fans of comedies such as 'Johnny English' or 'Mr Bean'.</p>\r\n	1	2011-03-26	279	2011-03-26
281	1	12	\N	Mirrormask	<p>Working as a juggler in the family circus, Helena wants to run away from the circus and have a real life. Her ironic wish is granted unexpectedly when she awakes one night to find herself somewhere else - a strange, yet familiar world populated with fantastic creatures. There she embarks on a quest to wake the Queen of Light, whose unnatural slumber has released deadly creatures from the Dark Lands. Whether a dream fuelled by her own imagination, or a true other world, Helena's only wish now is to return home.\r\n</p><p>\r\nDirector Dave McKean and writer Neil Gaiman are famous for a variety of reasons, not least of which is their work on the Vertigo Comics series <i>The Sandman</i>. They've also collaborated on a number of children's books, and <i>Mirrormask</i> is simply that - a children's book come to life. Gaiman provides a sparkling script that gives structure to McKean's celluloid vision, an explosion of visual splendour that has little in the way of comparative reference.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThis is a unique glimpse of McKean's singular and outlandish imagination, transformed by motion yet immediately recognisable to anyone familiar with his work. Budgetary concerns meant that all of the effects and fantasy visuals had to be achieved with CGI, but far from being a constraint this gives the freedom to indulge in some wild flights of fancy. White-furred doves with the bodies of gorillas, strange sphinxes with two-dimensional faces, stone behemoths who float in the air; there is a near deluge of detail that cannot be absorbed in one go.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThere is an unfortunate and palpable sense of narrative dj vu, but the characters are engaging and the dialogue is sharp and witty. Gaiman can be thanked therefore for the headstrong and intelligent Helena, but it is Stephanie Leonidas (Brief Encounters [TV]) who goes through the teenage emotional rollercoaster very convincingly for a 22-year-old. The Queen of Dark has less depth, but is played in a remarkably creepy manner by Gina McKee (The Lost Prince [TV]) who gives her a real presence with an undercurrent of menace.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOn the one hand the film is almost too extravagant, and the insubstantial CGI backgrounds eventually become a hindrance to believability, but it is all about the visuals in the end and they do carry one beyond the weakness of the story and into the sublime realms of the fantastic. Dave McKean's first venture into moving pictures is something extraordinary, and one can only wonder what he has in store for us next.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	281	2011-03-26
282	1	15	\N	The Hills Have Eyes	<p>Cross-country trips always seem to end in disaster in America. You would think city folk wouldn't keep on trying to take that short cut through wild country just because the toothless hick with the squint at the gas station says so. The not-happy-for-long campers this time are the Carter family who are driving across the New Mexico desert to get to San Diego and Dad Bob (Ted Levine - Memoirs of a Geisha) just can't resist that dirt track.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If this all sounds familiar it's because The Hills Have Eyes is a remake of Wes Craven's 1977 original or maybe because House of Wax and plenty of other films very much like it have followed exactly the same premise. Where this remake tries to differentiate itself from its predecessor is by offering up a nuclear fallout explanation for the bloodthirsty mutants that wait in the wilderness for their prey. This idea gives the film a few nice touches but what actually sets it apart is that the victims aren't a bunch of college jocks but a family, and the cast are made up of people who can act and aren't just taking time out from a stalling pop career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The principal reason this film is largely successful is because it invests enough time at the start of the movie in setting up a group of characters whose fate you do at least take some sort of interest in. Aaron Stanford (X2) is the pick of the bunch putting in a strong performance as the mild mobile phones salesman and young father who must fight for the first time in his life to protect his family. Teenager Bobby (Dan Byrd - A Cinderella Story) also gets to have some fun playing the resourceful boy scout as he sets up traps to discourage the freaks up among the rocks from approaching the shelter of the family's broken down trailer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hills Have Eyes represents part of a new gush of American horror flicks that are rejecting recent trends for tame bloodless 'horror' that younger audiences are allowed to watch and instead are forgoing the lower cinema certificates (and thus higher grosses) so they can push the boundaries of what is acceptable. A splash of colour, preferably red, certainly livens up proceedings and The Hills Have Eyes is a considerably more interesting two hours than the recently released, and appallingly bland, remake of <i>The Fog</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, while a storyline that features someone being hit in the head with a pickaxe and an ice cream freezer stuffed with severed limbs couldn't be described as easy watching for the squeamish, if the filmmakers' intention was to shock its audience it largely fails. Gory films, even though recently out of favour, are nothing new and the sexual assaults that take place during the initial attack on the family mostly take place behind the closed door of their silver trailer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film, while at times tense, is never frightening resulting in an end product that could be described as a competently made but very violent action film. Certainly the last 45 minutes, as the survivors of the first attack set about taking the fight to the enemy, is an exciting watch. It is hard not to cheer on each act of nasty retribution, although eventually I began to feel sorry for the unsuspecting mutants with their wonky teeth and old fashioned values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end the question must be asked whether remaking the film was worthwhile. It adds nothing to its genre that hasn't been witnessed a dozen times before but is still probably the best horror release of the year so far. Perhaps if everyone involved had devoted their talents to something original the film would have had more of an impact but the end result is a movie that in the future will struggle to cleave its way from the rest of the crowd.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	282	2011-03-26
287	1	15	\N	Hostel	<p>Directed by Eli Roth (Cabin Fever) and given the Quentin Tarantino blood stain of approval, Hostel has been described in some quarters as the sickest, most twisted film ever committed to celluloid. \r\n</p><p>\r\nNo-one of sound mind should even contemplate watching this film, anyone who does will immediately become a crazed psychopath and shortly after it is released the world as we know it will end, etc, etc. It isn't quite that bad but it is a gruelling watch that holds the distinction of actually making my stomach turn at one point. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe sequence of events that the filmmakers would evidently describe as a plot, but the film's target audience would probably describe as the dull bit at the start before people start dying horribly, sees three backpackers living nights of debauchery in the seedier dives of Amsterdam. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhile working their way through copious amounts of drugs they are told of a Hostel in Slovakia where the locals are almost exclusively made up of nubile women with loose morals who are desperate for masculine attention after conflict has decimated the local male population. Deciding this opportunity for easy sex can't be passed up the three loathsome lads hop on a train to a bleak industrial landscape and find that all the rumours are true. \r\n</p><p>\r\nHappily the trio are so distracted by their curvy roommates that they fail to notice that their fellow tourists seem to disappear off the map. Before you can say rusty drill bit each of the not terribly bright chaps find themselves shackled to a chair and faced by a man with an assortment of tools and sharp objects who has paid considerable money to use them. \r\n</p><p>\r\nUnderstandably the Slovakian government isn't at all best pleased with this film since it portrays their men folk as brutal murderers, their women as sleazy harpies and their children as packs of roaming animals willing to kill over a stick of chewing gum. \r\n</p><p>\r\nProbably not helping matters is that the film claims to be based on a true story, although the only 'facts' behind it appear to be that the film's premise was inspired by a website that Roth discovered, which offered those willing to pay for the privilege a supply of victims to murder. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAll this controversy that the filmmakers and some parts of the media have managed to stock up will undoubtedly draw in a much greater audience than could have been expected to a movie that is, frankly, mediocre. \r\n</p><p>\r\nRoth's debut film <i>Cabin Fever</i>, about a flesh eating virus, was an inconsistent fusion of comedy, splatter and a healthy dollop of just plain weird so Hostel is an improvement but still the first forty minutes of the film, probably intentionally, seem to bare little resemblance to the film's final hour. \r\n</p><p>\r\nFinally, just how horrible is Hostel? Well, a girl is blowtorched in the face, someone has an accident with a chainsaw and trying to run away after someone has snipped your Achilles tendon is not a good idea. Thankfully, the camera never lingers on these tortures, only showing brief images, skilfully leaving the audience's imagination to do the rest. Perhaps Mr Roth isn't going straight to hell after all?</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	287	2011-03-26
288	1	15	\N	Inside Man	<p>When a team of gadget-wielding criminals storm a Lower Manhattan bank and take the customers and staff hostage, Detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington - Man on Fire) is tasked with negotiating their safe release. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAs the day grows into night, however, Frazier begins to suspect that this crime isn't a run of the mill robbery. Dalton Russell (Clive Owen - Closer), the leader of the gang, seems supremely confident despite the ring of police surrounding the bank. Perhaps it's because he has an uncanny ability to predict exactly what the police are going to do. \r\n</p><p>\r\nFurther complicating matters is the bank's elderly owner (Christopher Plummer - Dragnet) who has secrets tucked away within the bank's safety deposit vault and he is prepared to do anything to prevent them from being revealed. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAs always with a film by director Spike Lee (25th Hour), there are several things you can count on; his New York locations will look great, his dialogue will be quick fire and his stellar cast will be on top form. Inside Man is no exception. \r\n</p><p>\r\nFrazier's easy charm with a hint of underlying sleaze is reminiscent of Washington's work in Out of Time and Training Day, but he has plenty of spiky conversations with Owen's smooth criminal and also with a venomous fixer played by Jodie Foster (Panic Room). \r\n</p><p>\r\nSpeaking of Foster, it comes as a pleasant surprise to see her given something to do other than her usual 'tough girl in peril' routine. She seems to be relishing playing a conniving ice queen who is employed by the bank's owner to guard his past. \r\n</p><p>\r\nClive Owen continues to impress and this role, as the quietly cunning thief, seems made for him. Of the main cast only Willem Dafoe (Spider-man) is given nothing much to do since his character spends much of the film languishing in the police command vehicle. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWith a cast as talented as the one that Spike Lee has managed to attract, Inside Man was never going to be a dull watch but, performances aside, the tried and tested bank robbery / hostage drama storyline doesn't exactly scream 'unique viewing experience' and so it proves. The robbers' aversion to violence means that an all action finale never develops and the revelations as they are revealed are not imaginative enough to reinvigorate an audience that are surely getting fidgety by the time this overly-long movie enters its final straight. \r\n</p><p>\r\nInside Man is Spike Lee's most crowd pleasing, commercial film to date but this reviewer found it to be so mainstream that it will probably be one of the director's least remembered.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	288	2011-03-26
289	1	20	\N	Failure to Launch	<p>With one of the least self explanatory titles of recent times, Failure to Launch is the latest romantic comedy to hit the big screen. In this new incarnation of the genre, a commitment phobic male, Tripp (Matthew McConaughey- Two For the Money), lives at home with his parents, avoiding maturity, and spending his spare time mucking around with his equally unfocused friends. \r\n</p><p>\r\nTo try and move their son from the family home and earn a peaceful retirement, Tripp's parents hire a relationship specialist, Paula (Sarah Jessica Parker - The Family Stone), to motivate Tripp's independence. Cue a series of embarrassing 'getting to know you' scenes and early romantic interludes. As Paula gets closer to Tripp, he tries to duck out of the relationship but she somehow manages to cling on by breaking her own rules.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAs you can imagine the flinty relationship expert starts to fall for the hunky man and sooner or later there will be a romantic crisis to force us all into a frantic final act. Thankfully this film has the lady making the almighty cock-up and having to chase the man for forgiveness contrary to the usual clich of the man chasing the woman regardless of blame.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWith a thin premise and a limited number of fresh ideas, this movie will not live long in the memory but does deliver on the chick flick chill out promise. A definite date movie this is a pleasant little comedy for couples to hold hands and should sneak a quick kiss you need not fear missing any crucial plot points.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMatthew McConaughey is his usual toned and tanned romantic lead and has some good chemistry with Sarah Jessica Parker who strays little from her stereotype. They compliment each other well and do have some comedy moments but a majority of the laugh out loud moments are thanks to the supporting cast.\r\n</p><p>\r\nZooey Deschanel (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) is hilarious as SJP's neurotic/psychotic flat mate who is conspiring to kill a disruptive mocking bird while attacking any man who strays across her path. Her energetic and violent wit is mostly directed on wannabe boyfriend Ace (Justin Bartha - National Treasure), Tripp's friend, who is captivated by her quirkiness as it mirrors his own dry eccentricity.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThis film is as thin as SJP and just as pleasant to watch. There are funny and sad moments, a few moments of stupidity, and of course a romantic and uplifting ending. This film is strongly recommended for fans of date movies such as <i>'How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days'</i> and <i>'Hitch'</i>.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	289	2011-03-26
291	1	15	\N	The Matador	<p>Pierce Brosnan's oozing performance in The Matador strongly suggests the powers that be behind the James Bond franchise ditched their leading man too soon. Not that hit man Julian Noble oozes charm and sophistication like Her Majesty's most celebrated secret agent, he is simply a slimy, sleazy piece of work.\r\n</p><p>\r\nShameless Julian struts around hotel lobbies in his underwear and eyes adolescent school girls while going about the unsavoury business of bumping off corporate bigwigs with contracts out on their lives. Virtually every sentence that spills out of his mouth is crude, offensive and laugh out loud funny; "I look like a Bangkok hooker on a Sunday morning after the navy's left town."\r\n</p><p>\r\nHe is a man who lives his life in hotels, brothels and through the telescopic scope of a sniper's rifle. He has no friends, family or connection to anything resembling a normal life. That is until, while on a job in Mexico City on another lonely birthday, he stumbles into a hotel bar and strikes up a conversation with Danny (Greg Kinnear - The Gift). Danny has his own problems, his career hasn't recovered after a period of redundancy several years before, his marriage hasn't recovered from the death of his young son and just before embarking on his business trip south of the border a falling tree wrecked his home.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAlthough their conversation gets off to a bumpy start thanks to Julian's inappropriate comments they manage to develop a slightly odd friendship and Julian invites Danny to attend a mesmerising bull fight. As blood is spilled in the arena beneath them both men begin to become involved in the other man's work.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBrosnan really is excellent and thoroughly deserved his Golden Globe nomination for this role. Greg Kinnear works hard not to distract from the fascinating creature that is Julian, but also does enough to make you care about both halves of this buddy comedy. His character has enough nuance and personality of his own to stop Danny from being simply Brosnan's straight man. Rounding out the cast is Hope Davis (The Weather Man) as Danny's wife Bean who, like a deer caught in a car's headlights, becomes transfixed by Julian when he turns up unannounced at Danny's home.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThis film may be a comedy and the premise of a salesman teaming up with a hit man to get a 'job' done may sound obvious and clichd but don't be deceived, The Matador doesn't feel like a Hollywood film and the performances, location plus a plot that takes its time and doesn't attempt to overreach itself keeps the action surprising, funny and fresh.</p>\r\n\r\n	3	2011-03-26	291	2011-03-26
292	1	15	\N	The Dark	<p>All is not well between Adele (Maria Bello - A History of Violence) and her teenage daughter Sarah. Adele can't stop losing her temper and Sarah clearly blames her mother for her parents' separation. In an attempt to help their relationship get back on track mum decides to take daughter to Wales to visit James (Sean Bean - National Treasure), Adele's estranged husband and Sarah's father, at his cliff top home. The scenery is spectacular but the vacation has its drawbacks. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe house has a creepy attic, the nearby abandoned abattoir isn't much better and the sheep are less than friendly. Considering Adele has also had several terrifying dreams about her daughter disappearing, Sarah's habit of wandering off alone is doing nothing to steady her nerves. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThis being a chiller, strangely vivid dreams should never be dismissed but Adele neglectfully allows little Sarah to play on slippery rocks that jut out into the sea. Yes, that's right; soon there is a lot of hysterical screaming quickly followed by an extensive search by the coastguard for a bobbing blonde body. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhile James helps down on the beach to look for his presumably drowned daughter, Adele is left to hold a lonely vigil back at the cliff top house, which is when she begins to see a blonde girl about her daughter's age running about outside in the dark. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThis film certainly won't win any plaudits for its drab title and the plot isn't far behind. Everything about the film feels familiar as if cobbled together from other movies, particularly The Sixth Sense and The Wicker Man. \r\n</p><p>\r\nMaria Bello gives it her all but she doesn't get much support with Bean having nothing much to do for a lot of the film except question his wife's sanity. We've seen plenty of spectral creepy girls before and the pair in this film just don't cut the mustard compared to the ghostly competition in The Grudge and The Ring. Only Maurice Roeves (The Last of the Mohicans) is worth watching as the slightly suspicious muttering local who knows more than he's letting on. \r\n</p><p>\r\nBasing the film on Welsh myths about individuals crossing back and forth between the land of the living and the world of the dead is actually quite a good idea, but the film doesn't build on its premise. When all the film's big scares are sheep-related you can be sure your movie is going to have a credibility problem. The last nail in this film's horror coffin is a finale that descends into a jumbled mess as Adele journeys into the underworld to retrieve her daughter and confront the forces that are holding her. The final moments of the movie possibly revealed a devious twist but the muddled narrative had left me bewildered long before then, thus rather lessening its impact.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	292	2011-03-26
294	1	15	\N	An American Haunting	<p>Set in Tennessee in 1818, An American Haunting recounts the legend of the Bell Witch, a supernatural force infamous for being held officially responsible for the death of a man, the first and only such case in the history of the United States. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe Bell family is led by patriarch John (Donald Sutherland - Pride & Prejudice), a respected landowner, whose fortunes take a turn for the worse when he is found guilty of charging an extortionate rate of interest on a transaction with local battle axe, and reputed witch, Kate Batts. \r\n</p><p>\r\nBefore the family can escape the courtroom, John is confronted by his still angry adversary and he and his teenage daughter Betsy (Rachel Hurd-Wood - Peter Pan) are cursed. Soon the grounds around the Bell property are being menaced by a snarling black wolf, Betsy is terrorised at night by an invisible force that tosses her about her bedroom like a rag doll and John has developed a nasty cough that is speckled with blood. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAs the attacks grow in frequency and ferocity local intellectual and teacher, Richard Powell (James D'Arcy - Exorcist: The Beginning), is enlisted to help devise an end to the Bell's torment while Betsy's mother, Lucy Bell (Sissy Spacek - North Country), begins to question the supposed motivation for the haunting. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSuperficially, An American Haunting seems to have plenty going for it. The historical timeframe sets it apart from its scary peers in what has recently become an overly congested genre. Rachel Hurd-Wood, taking the role of the ghost's principal victim, is clearly a very talented actress and the presence of veterans Donald Sutherland and Sissy Spacek give proceedings an added air of legitimacy. \r\n</p><p>\r\nUnfortunately experienced acting can't distract from the plodding plot development that promises little and delivers slightly less. After watching Betsy being flipped around the room a half dozen times, it becomes quite clear that this haunted house has nothing to offer but a poorly executed selection of the greatest hits from other superior pictures such as <i>Poltergeist</i> and <i>The Exorcist</i>. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe worst clich of the bunch is the repeated use of footage shot from the perspective of the spirit. The camera swirls around the creaking property, crashing into anyone who raises its ire but this trick hasn't been used straight since Sam Raimi deliciously served it up in his <i>Evil Dead</i> series. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe film's modern day introduction feels unnecessary and the coda, which returns to the 21st Century, confirms this by clumsily tacking on a connection between the two periods that is implausible, to say the least. It does, however, provide the film's one memorable image, that of Betsy gliding across the room in her blood stained nightdress. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAn American Haunting is bereft of originality and will disappoint the usual horror crowd since it is free of jumps, gore, chills and suspense. If, however, this still doesn't dissuade you perhaps I can instead recommend staying in and renting out <i>Sleepy Hollow</i>, which does contain all of the above and throws in a similar setting as well.  Recommended for fans of <i>The Exorcism of Emily Rose</i>.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	294	2011-03-26
295	1	15	\N	Silent Hill	<p>Silent Hill follows the long and proud tradition of films based on best selling computer games being utterly shit. Not only is it poorly acted, tedious and brutally violent, it also has the distinction of being one of the most bizarre films I have ever had the misfortune to sit through. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDead eyed moppet Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) is causing her adopted parents some worry. She wanders off from her home at night as if in a trance and whispers about a place called Silent Hill. The name doesn't conjure up images of sunshine and flowers and so it proves when mum Rose (Radha Mitchell - Man on Fire) drives up to the soot smeared community for a visit and promptly crashes her car, loses her daughter and gets arrested by a cop trapped in a uniform several sizes too small. \r\n</p><p>\r\nMeanwhile the usually reliable Sean Bean (Troy), playing dad Christopher and sporting an atrocious American accent, spends the entire movie getting drenched in the rain and researching the history of the ghost town. Rather unfairly he gives up on this endeavour, presumably because the results made no sense, and disappears back off to his home while the audience are forced to sit and languish through to the conclusion. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDeserted ghost towns are never really deserted in films such as these, but Silent Hill probably has a population larger than Leeds. Apart from its new guests, who find themselves unable to leave thanks to a chasm that now lies across every road out of town, they come across a weird religious cult, a girl very reminiscent of Rose's daughter, a crazy old hag and an assorted number of things that go bump in the night. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhy are things going bump in the night I hear you ask? It seems Rose and her policewoman companion are trapped in a limbo-like alternate reality where ash perpetually falls from the sky and common sense is an alien concept. This strange place then periodically transforms into a nightmare realm in which all manner of heinous figures stalk the buildings in search of, wait for it, revenge! \r\n</p><p>\r\nYes, you are quite correct, the plot is complete nonsense. Sadly you have to twiddle your thumbs for practically two hours to find out that what is happening is complete nonsense. Then, because the revelations make so little sense, the filmmakers immediately try and distract the audience by introducing some spur of the moment roasting of human flesh followed by an encore of dismemberment by barbed wire. Even fans of the game would be hard pressed to care by this point in the proceedings. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe monsters are the film's only highlights, with the lanky, acid spewing sack of skin being a particular favourite, although not as good as the crumple faced, scalpel wielding nurses that I found disturbingly attractive. Even some of these encounters are poorly judged however, with the screaming molten toddlers raising eyebrows rather than tension. \r\n</p><p>\r\nBy the end a host of questions were buzzing around my brain. What was the significance of the final shot? Who the hell was Rose's daughter really? Why did the spectral Sharon give the regular Sharon the evil eye? What did the nurse with the bleeding eyes have to do with anything? What happened to the guy with the dirty great big sword and why was he wearing that impractical helmet? Why was a town called Silent Hill, in the middle of a mountain range, so damn flat? The possibility that the only way of finding out the answers to these questions and a hundred others like it is by sitting through this infamy for a second time is perhaps the most terrifying thought of all. \r\n</p>	1	2011-03-26	295	2011-03-26
296	1	15	\N	Slither	<p>Citizen Kane and the Godfather are among a select few films that are often proclaimed by critics as cinema's finest achievements. I dispute this. It is a little known fact that the greatest motion picture of all time was a film released in 1990, starring Kevin Bacon, called <i>Tremors</i>. Despite the brilliance of a plot that revolved around four giant carnivorous worms preying on a small desert community, the film sadly didn't go on to become the highest grossing film of all time, nor did it win a single Oscar. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIn spite of this outrage Hollywood has finally woken up to the fact that carnivorous worms = genius and bestowed upon us Slither. \r\n</p><p>\r\nGetting the bad news out of the way first, Slither is not as good as Tremors, but then what could be? The worms in Slither aren't as big as those featured in its spiritual soul mate and they don't originate from the desert either. These slippery critters come from outer space and like nothing more than to crawl into your mouth, burrow into your brain and force you to do their bidding. \r\n</p><p>\r\nParasitic aliens clearly don't have the best taste in the world, however, since the original organism crash-lands its meteorite in the ugliest, most inbred town in all of America. Most of the extras actually look better once they become flesh-eating zombies. \r\n</p><p>\r\nStill one or two buck this trend, particularly leading lady Starla (Elizabeth Banks - The 40 Year Old Virgin). Despite marrying too young, Starla is determined to honour her vows to oafish husband Grant (Michael Rooker - Cliffhanger), but this union is sorely tested when he stumbles across the slug and becomes host to a tentacled monster. Grant's gradual evolution into the giant squid is startling. His final appearance as a pulsating fleshy mass that is absorbing the locals in its sticky embrace may well turn the odd stomach but it is great to see old fashioned special effects used to create such spectacular results. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThis is not the only moment that deserves an honourable mention in terms of yuck factor. Also of note is the death of the unfortunate hick who gets in Grant's way while out on the farm and the discovery of the women impregnated with a thousand of the aforementioned worms who dies as only an enormous human incubator can. \r\n</p><p>\r\nNathan Fillion produces an encore to his reluctantly heroic leading man role last seen in Serenity as Sheriff Bill Pardy. The small town good guy can't seem to quite get his act together in the face of the other worldly menace but he does try his best. Gregg Henry (Heartless [TV]) is clearly relishing playing the foul mouthed Mayor who tags along for the ride, and rounding out the cast is Tania Saulnier (She's the Man) as teenager Kylie who has a narrow escape from a body snatching worm in the bath tub. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe film's tongue in cheek B-Movie horror and obvious respect for video nasties makes for a surprisingly nostalgic viewing experience. The plot may have been thrown together from the types of film that only get shown on television after everyone has usually gone to bed but everything from the effects to the script has been crafted with care and affection. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAs much fun as slumming it for an hour and an half in exploitation horror is, Slither is a little too unsophisticated for its own good. The performances and effects are better than they have any right to be, but the script rarely offers any genuine wit to make this a great horror comedy and the central idea that Grant maintains his love for Starla beyond his transformation to mutant killing machine isn't exploited to great effect.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe badge of silliness that this film wears with pride might put off audiences, but this urge should be resisted. It really is worth watching, especially if you fancy a bit of a laugh and are capable of entering into the spirit in which the film has been made.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	296	2011-03-26
297	1	20	\N	16 Blocks	<p>Before the great empire that is China was formed, there were seven independent nations constantly at war. In Qin, one of the seven countries, the King desired peace through the unity. Alas, the only way to achieve unity was to conquer all seven nations. Of course this threw up more than a few enemies even if the King's motives were sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hero tells the story of the nameless warrior (Jet Li - The One) who arrives at the palace of the King of Qin (Daoming Chen) to report the death of the four most feared assassins from one of the neighbouring countries. The nameless warrior is cordially welcomed into the royal palace and invited to tell the emperor how he, one man, had succeeded against the most ruthless killers when so many before had failed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the nameless warrior tells his story we get to see flashbacks of his confrontations with the solitary spear wielding warrior, Sky (Donnie Yen - Blade II), the beautiful but tragic Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung), the young and passionate Moon (Zhang Ziyi - Rush Hour 2) and the thoughtful and wise Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu Wai - Infernal Affairs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With each part of the story told, the king allows the nameless warrior closer but the warrior may have underestimated the wisdom of the great king. The stories do not ring true in his mind and as the king searches through the warrior's tales to find the truth, we also see the layers of deception revealed. The truth is a powerful hidden story and when finally fully told is both tragic and inspiring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Director Yimou Zhang has created a visually rich film combining the stunning landscapes of China with tremendous wire fighting sequences that, although far fetched in western cinema, are an art form in their own right.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The severe and beautiful natural landscapes of China, the large armies and the location settings such as the royal palace and the besieged school of calligraphy, give a sense of scale to the movie that acts as much more than just a backdrop for the action. There is a strong attention to detail in each scene and this combined with a rich colour pallet gives the movie a great visual impact.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Jet Li is his usual quiet yet intense character in the lead role of the nameless warrior who narrates the various tales. In support, Tony Leung Chiu Wai has probably the most engaging character as assassin Broken Sword who has to choose between his various loyalties to either help the warrior or betray his love. Also worthy of special mention is Daoming Chen as the King of Qin who slowly unravels the tales of the nameless warrior. Although he spends most of his screen time seated, he displays a presence that gives his role as a King an air of sincerity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hero is a beautiful and artistic film set in the time before China. It is understandably filmed in Chinese and has English subtitles. The story, subtle at times, is also quite powerful. Why then should this artistic movie, this fine wine, be presented on 'Share My Popcorn'? A website devoted to the big budget crowd pleasers such as Collateral and Wimbledon? The answer is more complicated than the question but is full of hope, as is the movie.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The story of Hero and the cinematic style are truly artistic yet the film also contains excellent wire fighting sequences and kung fu. The casting of Jet Li in the principle role will attract western audiences who have enjoyed films such as 'The One' and 'Kiss of the Dragon'. In addition the popularity of 2000's Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon shows that there is a large and growing UK audience for artistic and thought provoking action movies from the Far East. Popcorn movies are above all other things popular, and whereas that used to suggest action films full of thin plots and big budget car chases, thankfully times are a changing.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>If you enjoyed Romeo Must Die, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or Kill Bill 1, I would recommend that you see this movie and more importantly see it on the big screen so you can get the most out of the great landscapes.</p> \r\n	3	2011-03-26	297	2011-03-26
299	1	27	\N	Confetti	<p>They say <i>"everyone loves a wedding"</i> and at Confetti magazine they thrive on them. The title's prestigious British bridal magazine, tired of running the annual 'prettiest bride competition' has decided to stage a new and bold contest. Three couples will get the chance to compete for a fabulous prize, a brand new house. To win the award they must come up with the most 'original' wedding.</p> \r\n<p>\r\nWith Confetti, newcomer Debbie Isitt, a relative unknown, has directed one of the most original and witty comedies I have seen in ages. Filmed in a mockumentary style, Confetti is a British romantic comedy filled with great humour mixed with genuine emotion but the most impressive aspect is that the film is almost entirely improvised. The ensemble cast was given a brief outline of the story and allowed to develop the scenes themselves with only a modest amount of direction. The result is a very realistic and fresh comedy that should delight a wide audience. \r\n</p><p>\r\nReturning to the story for a moment, try to imagine if you will the consequence of staging a musical wedding inspired by the early MGM movies; a naturist wedding with the necessary nudity; and a wedding inspired by tennis, all occurring back-to-back on live TV. Chuck in some camp wedding planners, a narrow minded magazine editor and a shallow competition organiser and you have a great recipe for comedy.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWith the recent epidemic of reality TV and talent shows such as 'Big Brother', 'I'm a Celebrity', 'Wife Swap', 'Shipwrecked', 'Pop Idol', 'X-Factor' and 'The Apprentice' but to name seven out of an ongoing list of mindless drivel, 'Confetti' is a nice comedy spin on these types of shows. The mockumentary style is not in itself original (ref. Tristram Shandy, The Office, etc), but it does add realism and makes for a fun adventure.\r\n</p><p>\r\nPersonally I am not a huge fan of weddings unless I am busy. I know that sounds awful but it is true. Unless I know the couple and feel in some small way involved, I get bored of the endless flowers, frills and perpetual smiling and my mind begins to wander. This film, however, allows you to get to know each couple, and as the actors are improvising throughout and remain true to character, they do connect with you and you do feel involved. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe cast of the movie is a key to its success and if the names of the actors are not immediately recognisable, their faces are. They are too many to mention here but of particular note are Martin Freeman (The Hitchhikers Guide to The Galaxy) as devoted but demoted Matt who will do anything to give his fiance the day of her dreams even if it means a full confrontation with her family. Also noteworthy are Olivia Colman (The Green Wing) and Robert Webb (The Smoking Room) who spend the majority of their scenes fully or near nude, a brave thing to do in a mainstream film that could have a huge audience. Lastly praise should also be handed to Vincent Franklin (Vera Drake) and Jason Watkins (Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason) as the two gay wedding planners who try to help each couple realise their dreams even if they find themselves under attack or on the attack as the tensions increase. Their comedy timing in their scenes and the eccentricity of their ideas were great.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter a spate of wet Hollywood romantic comedies such as <i>'Rumor Has It'</i> and <i>'Failure to Launch'</i>, this film finally breathes a bit of new life into the date movie genre and although it may not be huge or crammed with pretty people, its reality makes it all the more entertaining. If you love romantic comedies, wet or not, then this film will be a hit. If you don't necessarily like romantic comedies but enjoy English wit and a dash of satire, then this should make you chuckle. </p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	299	2011-03-26
300	1	16	\N	Prime	<p>When you have just struggled through a painful divorce and you just want to stay at home feeling sorry for yourself, why not bag yourself a cute toy boy and unleash your frustrations while reveling in physical bliss.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThat's just what Rafi (Uma Therman - The Producers) did when her marriage rumbled. Rafi has had a hard time and she spends an hour or so each week puring her heart out to her therapist Lisa (Meryl Streep - The Manchurian Candidate) who givers her advice on how to get her life back on track. \r\n</p><p>\r\nJust when Rafi is ready to give up men altogether she has a chance meeting with toy boy David (Bryan Greenberg - One Tree Hill [TV]), a fresh faced hunky young man who sweeps her off her feet.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn a whirlwind romance Rafi and David can't keep their hands off each other and seem to spend almost all of their time enjoying each other's company in the confines of the bedroom. \r\n</p><p>\r\nRafi revels in her joy and new found romance and doesn't hold back in telling her therapist all the intricate and intimate detailed about her exciting sex life. \r\n</p><p>\r\nUnbeknown to the Rafi, Lisa is in fact David's mother! Not only does she disapprove of their age gap but she also dislikes the fact that Rafi isn't Jewish.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter a soul searching Lisa decides it is best to keep schtum about what she knows while weighing up the ethical dilemma of whether she should continue treating Rafi as a patient. All the while she hopes that the affair is a mere fling and that the two will part so she can continue being an overbearing mother to her son and a good therapist to Rafi. However Rafi and David's relationship quickly escalates into love.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAlthough Rafi knows David is younger that her, he hasn't been entirely truthful with her. Even when she does find out that he is 14 years her junior she still finds it hard to end things as they have fallen so deeply. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAs things get more serious, David moves in with Rafi after he loses his job. But Rafi is very house proud and likes her space while David gets comfy as a lazy slob. Slowly the idyllic love is losing its glean and arguments start to break out. \r\n</p><p>\r\nOn top of the disapproval from his family, are Rafi and David destined to be together or apart?\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe acting in the film is highly commendable. Thurman puts in yet another sultry performance following her 'standing ovation' in <i>The Producers</i>. No doubt most of the male audience will fall for her more mature sex appeal in prime. Greenberg also puts in a convincing performance as the lovesick puppy who has to deal with a whole cycle of new emotions through out the film. Finally praise should also go to Streep as the source of well placed comedy caught in the middle.\r\n</p><p>\r\nPrime is not your run of the mill romantic comedy. It certainly has a healthy dose of humour but concentrates more on the ups and downs of relationships and the pressures of both age differences and cultural differences. The acting and story are both strong and it shies away from the typical formulaic rom-coms we are all so used to.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFans of <i>'Monster-in-Law'</i>, <i>'Melinda + Melinda'</i>, <i>'As Good As It Gets'</i> and <i>'Something's Gotta Give'</i> are sure to enjoy this movie.\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	300	2011-03-26
301	1	15	\N	When a Stranger Calls	<p>It was a dark and stormy night when the plucky teenage babysitter was left almost all alone in the remote lakeside house. The wind was howling and the phone wouldn't stop ringing. But who could be calling at such a late hour? Is it Bobby the recently dumped boyfriend? Perhaps it is Tiffany, the apologetic best friend? Or maybe it's a heavily breathing psycho who really shouldn't bother racking up charges on his phone since he is hiding upstairs in the kids bedroom anyway. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSharing its title with the 1979 original, this remake of When a Stranger Calls follows the nocturnal tribulations of babysitter Jill (Camilla Belle - The Lost World <i>{she got attacked by ickle dino's in the opening beach scene}</i>) who, while looking after two children in an ultra modern but isolated house in the woods, is menaced by a lurking killer. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIf this doesn't sound like the most high concept horror film ever made you would be right. In fact it is so formulaic I imagine even the twelve year old sleepover audience that the film is so clearly aimed at would be hard pressed not to doze off. The first ten minutes of <i>Scream</i>, which essentially shares the same plot as this film, packs in more scares than the entire dreary ninety minute running time of this effort. \r\n</p><p>\r\nCamilla Belle delivers her lines in a lazy monotone that suggest she won the role of Jill thanks to her looks rather than any underlining acting ability. With almost no supporting cast she appears in virtually every frame of the picture but is as lifeless as the succession of corpses she stumbles across during the all too brief finale. \r\n</p><p>\r\nGiven the lack of animation present in the leading lady, I can confidently describe the house itself as the real star of the show. Packed with nifty gadgets and landscaping worth killing for, the only downside is an interior cluttered with twisted sculptures and easily breakable pottery. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter more than an hour of false starts usually involving the cat, the shadowy figure finally emerges and the chase begins, but the inability of the film to spring even a single surprise during the finale makes the entire business frustratingly obvious. If only the filmmakers had tried to do something slightly inventive they might have salvaged something from this mediocrity. As it stands the film has practically nothing to recommend it to even the most undemanding of audiences.\r\n</p>\r\n	1	2011-03-26	301	2011-03-26
302	1	20	\N	The Da Vinci Code	<p>\r\nOne grey evening I awoke on my slow train home to find myself surrounded by zombie like commuters all transfixed with the same golden coloured book. That was my first glimpse of the 'DaVinci' code and my first experience of the book's effect. Within a week I joined the zombies and read my own copy and could see the appeal straight away. Dan Brown has written a great popcorn book that touches on some popular taboos adds a dose of action and suspense and just a mild dose of romance. No surprise then that the book was a huge success and that a movie adaptation was inevitable.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFor anyone out there who hasn't read the book but is thinking of seeing the film, please do. It's a nice entertaining movie. If you have read the book, think twice about seeing the film. Not because it in anyway diminished or distorts the book, it doesn't really, but it does hammer home one of the weaknesses in the book and reminds you why you haven't read it twice. If you have read it twice, firstly ask yourself why and secondly go and see the movie as you're obviously easily impressed.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThat last paragraph may be a little unfair, depends how you translate it really, and so we tap onto the next factor, hype. The DaVinci code makes some suggestions about the authenticity of the bible and the conduct of the Catholic Church. Of course anything that questions the holy text will be received badly by devout Christians and predictably this film has raised a few religious eyebrows. Is it really heretical? I'm not much of a theologian so you'll have to decide for yourself. Movies however...\r\n</p><p>\r\nImagining for a moment you haven't read the book, the story follows an American symbologist named Langdon (Tom Hanks - Terminal) who gets summoned to a murder scene within the Louvre to decipher symbols written on the body. No sooner has he arrived when a female cryptologist (Audrey Tautou - A Very Long Engagement) warns him that the police captain is building a case to arrest Langdon for the murder. With only moments to form a plan, the two divert the police so they may decipher the riddles on and around the corpse, riddles that will send them on a quest that may shatter history as we know it. Sounds good doesn't it?\r\n</p><p>\r\nDirected by Ron Howard (Apollo 13) and starring Tom Hanks, Audrey Tautou, Jean Reno, Paul Bettany, Alfred Molina and Sir Ian McKellen (LOTR), this is a big budget movie with great ingredients. Sadly the book had a few weaknesses and the movie if anything magnified them. The characters in the book are not fully explored and events transpire so quickly that you do not get much time to form any kind of bond. As a result the adventure, although interesting, loses an element of peril as you don't really care too much what happens to the characters.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAudrey Tautou as frosty cryptologist Sophie takes a little time to defrost and although we see snippets of her past we don't really get to know much about her. Audrey's acting is great and she has such a cute face, sadly the script didn't give her much time to show us how good we know she can be. A sad error as she is the main character in this story along with Langdon. Hanks, as the American symbology expert, was his usual everyday hero pitted against seemingly impossible odds who manages to decipher each code just in time. These two lead actors had some chemistry but more a fizz rather than anything convincing. The really memorable moments belonged to McKellan (LOTR) as eccentric British Academic Sir Leigh Teabing whose encyclopedic knowledge of history mixed with his disdain for the French added much needed moments of levity. On the other hand Paul Bettany (Master and Commander) was terrific as albino killer monk Silas, who viciously punishes himself after each condoned murder. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe Da Vinci Code is a fun and thought provoking movie that should entertain those who have not read the book, but may feel a little bland for those who have. The weakness I inferred earlier rests mainly in characterization. The characters are never really developed as there are too many scenes and sets to squeeze in. The most dramatic moments in the movie are actually references to historic events rather than the stories central chase and the constant need to relate history slows down that central chase so that it feels more like a brisk walk than a mad sprint. \r\n</p><p>\r\nForgive my diatribe; this is a good solid movie that suffers from over hype. Forget what you have read and watch the movie with an impartial eye and you'll enjoy the chase and the mystery. Think of this film as half way between <i>'National Treasure'</i> and <i>'Enigma'</i>.  It's thought provoking but not overly inspirational, fun but not particularly memorable. \r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	302	2011-03-26
303	1	20	\N	X-Men - The Last Stand	<p>The mutant crisis <i>seems</i> to have abated for the time being what with a mutant friendly president in power and a mutant ambassador protecting the rights of the mutant community. However Magneto (Ian McKellen - The DaVinci Code) is still on the loose and a pharmaceutical company has developed a cure for the mutant 'condition'. If that wasn't worrying enough a new and dangerous threat to the world rests beneath the tranquil waters of Alkali Lake.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAt the end of the second movie Dr Jean Grey (Famke Janssen - Hide and Seek), who possessed awesome telekinetic power, was seemingly washed away by raging water when she saved the X-Men crew from a burst dam. Early in this latest, and possibly last, installment of the X-Men franchise Jean Grey is found by the shores of the lake and she is suffering from a split personality. Safely back at the home of Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart - Chicken Little) we learn that Jean Grey was the happy and peaceful faade of a more unstable mutant, Phoenix, who had almost unlimited power and hardly any self control.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWith Magneto stirring up concern, justified or not, about the apparent cure so he can start a mutant uproar, the X-Men crew already have enough on their plate let alone a deranged hyper powerful mutant. It doesn't take too long for everything to go pear shaped and a mutant war to commence.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFilled with action and a fair few new mutants added to the fray, this is a fun film that nicely picks up pace until the final climatic showdown. Returning to the fray are among others Wolverine (Hugh Jackman - Van Helsing), Storm (Halle Berry - Catwoman), Mystique (Rebecca Romijn - Godsend), Iceman (Shawn Ashmore - X2) and Rogue (Anna Paquin - X2), who are joined by even more wonderful new mutants. Among the newcomers are Dr Hank McCoy (Kelsey Grammer - Frasier [TV]) as a mutant ambassador, Angel (Ben Foster - Hostage) who...er... has wings, Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones - She's the Man) who can break through anything and Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page - Hard Candy) who can run through anything. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWith so many newcomers to the franchise, this one movie didn't give much time to introduce each mutant's new powers to any real degree so for the most part the newcomers make little impact. Luckily the story is suitably fast paced and has some comedy moments all rolled in with a semi-sad-expected departure for one or two of our heroes. The effects are good and the returning cast keeps the movies well connected. If you are a fan of the earlier movies then I think you'll like this third installment.\r\n</p><p>\r\n<i><b>Is this the end of the franchise?</i></b>\r\n</p><p>\r\nWell, like its predecessors, this movie does hint at possible sequels and spin offs so I doubt we've seen the end of the mutants. In a film dominated more by effects and action than story and character development, a fourth chapter would probably be welcome and if the studios think it'll make money I am sure we'll see the clan again.\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	303	2011-03-26
305	1	20	\N	Scary Movie 4	<p>Scary Movie 4, why bother making it, marketing it or watching it? That's what I thought and half of me still can't believe I went to watch it. The other half, that half was pleasantly entertained for a couple of hours and I did laugh my head off a few times.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSo how do you review a movie like that? I am not a huge fan of horrors, especially limp western remakes of eastern cult movies or once great classics. The Scary Movie series constantly finds clich's in modern horror flicks and their naff actors, which it imitates and degrades. The formula has been successful enough to sporn three mediocre movies and judging by this film they will carry on until someone forcibly stops them.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThis time round the chief targets were 'War of the Worlds', 'The Grudge', 'Saw' and 'The Village'. In particular the thin story connection focuses on Tom (Craig Bierko - Cinderella Man), a vain and dim witted Tom Cruise copy, and Cindy, (Anna Faris - Just Friends), a dizzy nurse akin to Sarah Michelle Gellar.\r\n</p><p>\r\nTom is looking after his children for the weekend when he falls instantly in love with his new neighbour, Cindy, who is a nurse caring for a catatonic patient living in the haunted house next door. Just as love starts to blossom, aliens attack and our two clichd lovers are separated. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhile Tom tries to take his children safely to their loving mum, Cindy, following a hint from an un-dead Japanese child, heads off to the mysterious village where a recluse holds the secret to destroying the Martians. Wait a moment! That sounds like a plot. Well that's about all there is along with countless little stabs at recent movies including 'Brokeback Mountain', 'Dawn of the Dead' and 'The Oprah Winfrey Show [TV]'.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe performances are fairly crap but what were you really expecting? Some of the jokes are good but most of them are crap, again, what were you expecting? In short, this was a poor pun on various naff films so it was always going to be a house built on sand. It was no-brainer derivative trash aimed at a young popcorn audience and although it made me chuckle a few times, it was mostly....crap. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIf you enjoyed the earlier Scary Movie comedies or the recent 'Date Movie', then you should enjoy this short helping of silliness.</p>\r\n	1	2011-03-26	305	2011-03-26
309	1	15	\N	Waiting	<p>\r\nCovering a single day in the lives of down trodden waiters and chefs, Waiting is a gross out comedy designed to appeal to plenty of teenagers working dreary Saturday jobs as well as those in their early twenties who have yet to give into the inevitable and embark on a career. \r\n</p><p>\r\nMild mannered Mitch is starting his first full shift at Shenaniganz restaurant, a family friendly place where the behind the scenes antics of the staff are anything but. Mitch is entrusted into the care of old hand Monty (Ryan Reynolds - Just Friends), a predatory man-child who uses his creepy charm to sleep with underage staff and customers. So begins the shift for Mitch as the staff stumbles into work with hangovers and relationship issues all round and are pitted against a crowd of unpleasant diners whose every action only makes the waiters' day harder. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhile Ryan Reynolds may be the star name in this ensemble comedy, he certainly isn't the film's heart. That thankless task falls to Justin Long (Herbie), who plays Dean, a waiter who has been sitting out his life in the shelter of Shenaniganz while his old school friends have been busy graduating from college. After putting off any sort of decision about his future for the past four years Dean is finally forced to make a choice when he is offered a promotion to deputy manager. Is he just killing time waiting for something to happen, or has his part time job turned into his career without him noticing? \r\n</p><p>\r\nAs for Reynolds, he is once again playing the same smug sarcastic guy who only has time for himself and maybe a little spare for the teenage temptress working as the restaurant's hostess. Having already perfected this character in 'Van Wilder' and 'Just Friends' Reynolds can do this material in his sleep, which is just how his performance comes off. Some of the characters and their idiosyncrasies work while others fall flat on their face. Bishop (Chi McBride) is entertaining as philosophising kitchen worker who dispenses advice to all comers over a cigarette while angry Naomi (Alanna Ubach) is just annoying as she screams and wails abuse at anyone who dares get in her way. \r\n</p><p>\r\n<i>Waiting</i> doesn't actually have any particularly witty moments relying on nudity and abusive behaviour to generate its laughs. Also it doesn't have anything inspired to say about working in a restaurant. Observations such as customers can be rude and tip badly won't be a revelation to anyone although it might make people a little less eager to complain about their food after a rather frightening depiction of kitchen revenge. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe film will appeal to the thousands of young people reassured that they are not alone in not knowing what to do with their lives. It does have its funny moments including an ongoing game in which the participants try and trick their unsuspecting colleagues into looking at their exposed genitals as they go about their work. The final scene when Mitch makes his decision about whether he wants to experience another day working at Shenaniganz is also a nice moment. Though the film is unlikely ever to reach the cult status of other slacker movies like <i>'Office Space'</i> or <i>'Clerks'</i>, it's an okay way to waste some time.\r\n</p>	2	2011-03-26	309	2011-03-26
311	1	20	\N	Poseidon	<p>It was a wet day in the middle of London's apparent drought when I swam to the offices of those lovely people at Warner Bros who kindly invited me to a preview screening of Poseidon. My editor was supposed to join me but ironically she was on a cruise ship. As the movie started a wave of worry (pardon the pun) washed over me, thankfully she survived.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOn New Years Eve, aboard the luxury cruise ship Poseidon, the happy guests party the night away unaware of the imminent danger. Meanwhile, on the bridge the first officer suspects something is wrong with the eerily calm sea. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAs everyone else cheers in the New Year a lone guest suffering from heartbreak walks onto the deck with the intention of topping himself. With one foot on the deck rail he notices something on the horizon, an enormous wave taller than the ship itself. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDirector Wolfgang Peterson (Troy) presents a modern remake of the 1972 disaster classic <i>'The Poseidon Adventure'</i>. His past movies such as <i>'Das Boot'</i> and <i>'The Perfect Storm'</i> have explored the power and wonder of the sea and the dangers when that power turns against us. With Poseidon he continues this exploration.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFor those unfamiliar with the Poseidon story, and who have not seen a poster, the film follows the adventures of a small group of survivors trying to escape from a capsized and sinking luxury liner.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOn paper I bet this movie was a great idea. The original disaster movie was a smash hit at the box office using some of the best special effects of the day. In the 34 years that have since passed special effects have evolved and surely the film can too, surely.\r\n</p><p>\r\nI went to the screening of Poseidon with fond memories of the original and high hopes for the disaster flick. As the credits started, the first frame was a sweeping special effect shot of the modern day Poseidon eventually focusing on one of the lead characters jogging on deck. The ship didn't look real, it looked generated and the jogger looked poorly pasted on top. Not a convincing opening. Luckily the film recovered quite quickly with some nice internal shots as we meet the soon-to-be victims or heroes.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThere is a former New York mayor and fireman (Kurt Russell - Sky High), a self serving professional gambler (Josh Lucas - Stealth), a heartbroken but wealthy gay architect (Richard Dreyfuss - Silver City), a single mum and her young son and a stowaway girl hoping to visit her sick brother in New York. Now is the time to place your bets on who will survive.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWhat follows is an almost direct repeat of the original with lots of cramped claustrophobic sets with the few survivors battling the rising water, the occasional fire and some difficult decisions as they fight to find a way out. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe acting for the most part was ok and the movie does provide some tense moments. Sadly the film is so similar to its original that you can't help but compare the two films and herein lies the problem. <i>The Poseidon Adventure</i> had ground breaking effects combined with an original story and some great acting from its lead, Gene Hackman. The remake cannot boast the greatest effects or win any points for originality, which leaves the movie's success resting with human story or an audience unfamiliar with the original.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAs for the main stars, Dreyfuss was underused as the camp architect who chooses life after the wave spoils his suicide attempt. Russell, an action movie veteran, was on good form as the retired New York mayor trying to repair his relationship with his feisty daughter while trying to keep them both alive. Lucas, still suffering from post-<i>Stealth</i> depression, manages to earn a reprieve from eternal mediocrity with a fairly convincing portrayal of a self centred man who learns, through disaster, the importance of life. Sadly, these characters all melded together and never really made a connection with me. There were some good moments but the film needed a bit more of an emotional punch. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAside from my desire to up the death toll among the heroic band, the film was a good all round crowd pleaser and should go down (another poor pun) with a wide audience. Recommended for fans of <i>'The Perfect Storm'</i> and <i>'The Day After Tomorrow'</i>.</p> \r\n	3	2011-03-26	311	2011-03-26
312	1	23	\N	The Omen 666	<p>Watching <i>The Omen</i> you get the impression you've been here before. Not only because it's a remake of one of the finest moments of 1970s horror, but because in the meantime other films have stolen from the original, leaving the remake feeling like a rehash of nearly three decades of cinematic half-inching. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe original laid the blueprint for chilling use of a decidedly creepy child, but since then Hollywood and Japan have taken the formula marathon miles. <i>Stir of Echoes</i>, <i>The Sixth Sense</i>, <i>The Grudge</i> and <i>The Ring</i> all had sprogs far more chilling than <i>The Omen's</i> Damien (Seamus Davey Fitzpatrick). \r\n</p><p>\r\nRichard Donner's original trod the fine line between pantomime gothic and out-and-out horror, but it did so with stripped down visual sensibility that lent a sense of realism to the albeit ludicrous proceedings. But the remake lays the gore, cheap scares and painfully obvious symbolism on so thick that is actually garners more (unintentional) laughs than it does genuine moments of terror. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhereas the infamous decapitating of photographer Keith Jennings (David Warner) in the original had 70s audiences gasping in the aisles, modern cinemagoers raised on <i>Hostel</i>, <i>Saw</i> and <i>The Descent</i> are made of sterner stuff. The attempt to eclipse this seminal death in the remake comes across like a Final Destination outtake. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThere are a few moments when the director makes the audience jump, but it's a cheap conjurer rather than horror magician at work. It becomes frustrating watching a film constructed entirely from tired horror clichs. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhy does every significant meeting have to take place under thunderous sky; why does director (John Moore - Flight of the Phoenix) find it necessary to convey the inevitable demise of Julia Stile's (The Prince and Me) Katherine Thorn by swathing her in red all the time; and why does no one spot how blatantly evil Mia Farrow's (Third Watch [TV]) nanny is? In fact, why is the word that most comes to mind when watching this moribund rehash. It throws up the pertinent question, why bother in the first place?</p><p>\r\n	1	2011-03-26	312	2011-03-26
314	1	15	\N	Stay Alive	<p>Elizabeth Bathory was a sixteenth century Hungarian Countess with a penchant for torturing her female servants to death. During a raid on her castle in 1610 some fifty bodies were discovered. Although never brought to trial Bathory was suspected of killing up to 650 young girls in a variety of grisly ways and spent the end of her life imprisoned at home on the Romanian border until her death in 1614. \r\n<p></p>\r\nAccording to the legends that have grown up around this ghoulish figure, the Countess supposedly bathed in the blood of young virgins believing it to reverse the ageing process and was one of the inspirations for Bram Stokers' Dracula. \r\n<p></p>\r\nAccording to the legend, however, at no point did she ever develop and star in her own Playstation game. As a result the filmmakers of Stay Alive have been forced to take a few liberties with the Countess, who for some reason now resides not in historical Eastern Europe but modern day New Orleans. She has also, despite being dead, decided to continue with her hideous hobby, mutilating geeks from beyond the grave. \r\n<p></p>\r\nFirst up is poor Loomis who has been testing a new videogame about Bathory and ends up croaking in exactly the same way he did in the game. Fellow gamer and personality vacuum Hutch (Jon Foster), thinks this is pretty strange and is even more perplexed when his boss also shuffles off this mortal coil a few minutes after he is wiped out of the very same game. \r\n<p></p>\r\nHutch begins to inexplicably wonder whether there could be some sort of supernatural connection between the game and the fates of those who play it. Of course there is, it's a horror film you moron! \r\n<p></p>\r\nSome film premises scream stupid so loudly that you wonder how any studio in their right mind would seriously green light a project so obviously bad. The fact that those responsible for this mess wasted probably around a year of their lives in its creation is comforting since the end result of all their time and effort at least only stole around ninety minutes of my mine. \r\n<p></p>\r\nThe film, apparently on the studio's insistence, proves to be a member of the ever-expanding breed of annoying horrors that cut away from scenes when blood is about to be spilt. This begs the question as to why the filmmakers imagine we are watching their rubbish in the first place.  It isn't for the sparkling dialogue or the multi layered characterisation. It's to see the cast of tedious teen dramas get cut to ribbons. \r\n<p></p>\r\nIt can't be long before the first U rated horror is sprung on unsuspecting audiences. The killer will do away with his victims by tickling them to death or by beating their brains out with extra soft pillows. One unlucky soul could die of dehydration after being force fed an entire packet of Rusks. The only member of the cast who even made a slight effort at acting was sad little Frankie Muniz (Malcolm in the Middle [TV]) and I'm not convinced that the haunted terror visible in his eyes was part of his performance or simply a realisation that his days as a successful child actor are over and only years of crushing mediocrity lie ahead. \r\n<p></p>\r\nStay Alive is a film that takes slasher stupidity to new levels. One pea brained victim sees the deadly ghost, follows the deadly ghost, catches up with the deadly ghost, grabs the deadly ghost's attention, runs away from the deadly ghost and then looks surprised when the deadly ghost proves to be deadly. Perhaps she would have realised her fate if she spent more time watching bad horror films instead of playing really bad video games?</p>\r\n	1	2011-03-26	314	2011-03-26
315	1	15	\N	Thank You For Smoking	<p>Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart - Paycheck) is a spokesperson for a cigarette lobby group funded by the tobacco industry. Nick's job is to defend his paymasters and their product from liberal politicians, medical science and the vindictive media. This smooth talking player neatly sidesteps the truth but worries whether he is the kind of man his teenage son can respect when the rest of society so clearly doesn't.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs befitting the son of comedy legend Ivan, Jason Reitman has congregated a cast of reasonably well known, but more importantly, very talented actors around him for his directorial debut. No doubt adding to the attraction is a genuinely funny script that pokes fun at the dark art of spin and America's ability to accept even the worst behaviour if it is presented with the right coat of gloss.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nEckhart puts in another sublime performance that proves beyond doubt that he has all the necessary qualities to become one of Hollywood's leading actors should he decide to pursue more mainstream roles. Nick Naylor is so good at manipulating people that it is impossible to begrudge the man for using his talent so effectively, even if he is using it to promote cigarettes. His bribery of a cancer suffering ex-employee who is making bad press is a work of art. He also remains surprisingly sympathetic in his attempts to present himself as a good role model to his son without ever compromising his roguish nature.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe very black comedy is delivered by a lively supporting cast who all seem to be having fun. The best moments feature Naylor's MOD (Merchants of Death) Squad, a trio of lobbyists for morally dubious interests who regularly congregate to drink and engage in pissing contests about the lethalness of their products. Mario Bello (A History of Violence) represents alcohol interests and David Koechner (The Dukes of Hazzard) gets all the best lines as the firearms advocate.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOn the flip side of these entertaining performances is Katie Holmes (Batman Begins) who once again struggles to recapture the ease of her earlier films although in this case it can mostly be attributed to the lazily underwritten role of an investigative journalist that she simply can't do anything with.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor once Cameron Bright (Running Scared), taking on the part of Nick's son Joey, doesn't have to play the creepy kid with special abilities but he comes across creepy nevertheless. The continuing casting of Bright (also currently appearing in <i>X Men 3</i> and <i>Ultraviolet</i>) provides further evidence that he is the only male child actor working in Hollywood today.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nReitman's debut feature shows that he has inherited more than a little of his father's flare and should be doubly praised for writing the sparkling script. Thank You For Smoking is too light a satire to land any hard punches on either the tobacco industry or its opponents and probably won't be long remembered, but for anyone who fancies watching a comedy with genuine wit and no reliance on toilet humour, it shouldn't be missed.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	315	2011-03-26
317	1	20	\N	The Lake House	<p>Twelve years ago an overrated action movie (Speed) reignited the career of Keanu Reeves (Constantine) and helped boost the career of a sexy new starlet, Sandra Bullock (Miss Congeniality 2). Since then both stars have enjoyed ups and downs in their respective movies and now for the first time in twelve years they meet again on screen.\r\n</p><p>\r\nA remake of a Korean movie (Il Mare), The Lake House tells the story of two consecutive tenants of the same property who strike up an unusual correspondence and ultimately fall in love. The twist is that the characters are two years apart, a small science fiction element to an otherwise reality based romance.\r\n</p><p>\r\nKate (Sandra Bullock), is a successful but lonely young doctor. She has had boyfriends in the past but finds it hard to commit, always waiting for Mr Right. After a few happy years living in a beautiful lake house, she decides to leave bad memories behind and forge a new life in the city. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAlex (Keanu Reeves), an architect himself and son of a world famous architect, is trying to make a career on his own and quietly hopes to patch things up with his self obsessed father Simon (Christopher Plummer - Inside Man). He is a reliable bloke who has been wandering for a few years and in a bid to get back on track with his life he purchases an old derelict lake house that he will slowly renovate. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhen he moves in, Alex finds a letter from the former owner, Kate, curiously dated two years in the future and apologising for dog paw prints on the front path that do not exist. Alex dismisses the letter until one day his new pet dog accidentally walks paint down the path. Curious about the coincidence Alex writes a letter to the former owner. As the two owners strike up a correspondence they soon realise the truth, they are writing across time.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWhat follows is a touching well scripted romance spanning the time difference that adds an element of magic to the story. Far from being considered a romantic comedy, this is instead a nice drama with elements of humour and tragedy.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBoth Bullock and Reeves put in strong performances reminding us that they can actually act rather that rely on special effects or action sequences. Director Alejandro Agresti carefully explored the time distortion in the plot and offers no obvious explanation (although there are hints), instead he focuses the film on the characters and each of their stories allowing each major star to shine brightly. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDifficult to classify as romance, drama, or science fiction, the film is all of these at once making it a great date movie. If you imagine a line between the popcorn <i>'Just Like Heaven'</i> (3 stars) and the dark surrealistic romance <i>'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'</i> (5 stars), I would place Lake House just past halfway towards Kaufman's Eternal Sunshine. It's a great date movie with a thought provoking twang.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><i>~~~ As this film has certain science fiction elements there is a small addition to this review further down the page for any sci-fi fans reading this review. ~~~</i></p>\r\n<br>\r\n</p><p>\r\nSome science fiction peeps may watch this movie and stumble upon a possible paradox. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAs a movie geek I get annoyed by inconsistencies but as Bono says, 'Every artist is a cannibal, every poet is a thief. All kill their inspiration and sing about their grief'. If these films didn't make mistakes us geeks would have nothing to whine about. \r\n</p><p>\r\nReturning to The Lake House, the movie explores a time dilation and at several points in the movie one character makes an alteration to the natural sequence of events that affects a change in the future, or the past. I have pondered the film and I think it is actually sound. Without explaining the events, and necessarily writing spoilers, I would try to explain it as follows. \r\n</p><p>\r\nTime travel is a dangerous ground to explore in a movie as most people try to apply logic using cause and effect. True these are elements for consideration in time travel but then again so is perception. If you are the time traveler your perception may not necessarily follow from a change/cause you have created as you are the product of the original timeline, the original cause. If you tie this in with the movie, then I think you'll find that the time tinkering in the plot does stand up and the universe will not implode. \r\n</p><p>\r\nObviously I could be wrong and I am sure you'll email to let me know.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	317	2011-03-26
321	1	15	\N	Reeker	<p>Sitting down to watch <b><i>Reeker</i></b> one wondered whether it had ever occurred to its creators that a horror movie that revolves around an unpleasant smell might not be the most effective use of what is principally a visual medium. \r\n</p><p>\r\nOn screen the reek of the title is represented by a rippling haze in the air that denotes the nearby presence of a drill-wielding, and smelly, figure in a shroud. To my surprise I also noticed that within minutes of the film starting there was an unnatural pong in the air. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWas it a film studio stunt, or had some audience member lost control of their bodily functions, terrified after seeing a family slam bonnet first into an inattentive deer during the opening scene? Perhaps the air conditioning system was malfunctioning and something nasty was accidentally being pumped into the cinema? \r\n</p><p>\r\nAn even more likely source for the stench however was from the ludicrously bad acting up on the screen. For the first 20 minutes the film really struggles with its low budget limitations. The dialogue is stilted and the acting is barely of a school play's standard. The five members of this desert road trip are supposed to hardly know each other but they seem to have even less familiarity with the script. As night falls however, and the band of 'soon-to-be-mutilated' mates find that they are alone at the spooky roadside motel, Reeker starts to find its feet. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe cast interaction begins to feel a bit more natural, the annoying bloke goes off by himself (but sadly comes back alive), the attractive blonde wanders around wearing just her pants and thankfully Michael Ironside (Starship Troopers) turns up. His role may be brief but Ironside is a dependable B-Movie actor who will lend a little class to any old straight to video nonsense. As his husky voice croaks that he has been searching the road for his missing wife for hours the audience can relax, safe in the knowledge that carnage can't be far away. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSurprisingly Reeker restrains itself from bumping off its cast for practically half the film. This slow burn approach is actually reasonably effective in building tension; tension that is quickly lost once the blood does start to spill. Only the demise of one character down the toilet is imaginatively handled. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAnother problem the film has is the introduction of so many supernatural elements without bothering to explain them until the final five minutes. Some may find the mystery intriguing but the revelation when it comes makes much of what has gone before irrelevant anyway. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSo apart from poor acting, few scares and a visibly low budget, what else does Reeker have to recommend it? Sometimes it is simply a clever line of dialogue, an unexpected plot development or a joke that generates a laugh, but every few minutes or so the cast and crew manage to conjure a brief moment that belongs in a better movie. They combine to save the film from being a complete stinker. \r\n</p><p>\r\nRecommended for fans of <i>'Wrong Turn'</i>, <i>'Identity'</i> and <i>'House of Wax'</i>. </p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	321	2011-03-26
322	1	16	\N	Over The Hedge	<p>It's almost the end of the hibernation period and soon the woodland's foragers will awaken to start harvesting food for the next winter. But not all our furry friends are still asleep. Active raccoon RJ (Bruce Willis - Lucky Number Slevin) has a hungry tummy and he will do anything to get some quick grub, even if it risks waking Vincent (Nick Nolte - Hulk), a really angry bear.\r\n</p><p>\r\nRJ's plan for a quick food heist fails miserably, the bear is awoken and the food destroyed. RJ is left with a huge debt to repay to vicious Vincent. He must gather all the food he lost by the end of the week or become Vincent's last warm meal.\r\n</p><p>\r\nRJ knows he is facing a huge challenge so he sets off into the woodlands for inspiration. Here he comes across a family of foragers led by cautious tortoise Vern (Gary Shandling - Dr Dolittle).\r\n</p><p>\r\nEach of the foragers has their own distinctive abilities. The possums (William Shatner - Boston Legal [TV] and Avril Lavigne [Pop rock sensation]) can play dead, squirrel Hammy (Steve Carell - 40 Year Old Virgin) can dart around extremely fast, the hedgehogs (Eugene Levy - The Man, Allison Janey - The West Wing [TV]) can fire darts and Stella the skunk (Wanda Sykes - Monster-in-Law) can, well...you know what she can do.\r\n</p><p>\r\nRJ looks on this family of eccentrics and has a brainwave, he can use his new found friends to help him gather the food he needs. So he approaches the group just as they discover a scary new landmark in their idyllic woodland. It's huge, green and prickly. To us humans it's merely a bush but to our furry friends it is a portal to an unknown world.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOn the other side of the hedge is suburbia, a town full of humans, food and other new and exciting possibilities. RJ uses these wonders to seduce the family of foragers to help him gather the food he needs under the pretence of preparing for the winter to come. \r\n</p><p>\r\nVern is sceptical and he tries to convince the group to carry on foraging on their own turf but the attractions of the new world are just too hard to resist. The furry foragers get caught up in all sorts of scams and face endless adventures as well as having to evade capture by the town's 'verminator'. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAs you can expect, RJ's lies and deception soon start to falter and as he battles with his guilt the truth starts catching up at a pace and there is going to be a huge showdown.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWillis supplies determination and leadership qualities to the voice of action raccoon RJ while Carell lends his vocal talents to the hilarious crazy hyperactive squirrel, Hammy. Hysterical one-liners are delivered by Sykes as the single skunk with attitude and there is even some ironically overacted dialogue from William 'Captain Hammy' Shatner.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOver the Hedge is an action packed fun filled animation suitable for the whole family, and immature boyfriends. Watch it if you enjoyed <i>Shrek 2</i> and <i>Madagascar</i>.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	322	2011-03-26
323	1	20	\N	Pirates of the Caribbean - Dead Mans Chest	<p>For decades the Pirate movie seemed stuck in a rut and could do little to gain box office success and then all of a sudden we were stunned by <i>'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl'</i> in the summer of 2003. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThat movie followed the nave blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom - Kingdom of Heaven) as he teamed up with an opportunistic scoundrel, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp - Finding Neverland), to save his one true love Elizabeth (Kiera Knightley - Pride & Prejudice) from the clutches of evil Pirate Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush - Munich). \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe film was packed with sword fights, word play, slapstick comedy, and quite a dark storyline regarding a cursed treasure and a crew of condemned souls. The constant back and forth allegiances, sharp wit, and comedy mannerisms of Captain Jack made Johnny Depp's antihero an icon overnight and secured him a best actor nomination.\r\n</p><p>\r\nNow three years later the sequel hits the screen and anticipation is high. The happy life of Will and Elizabeth is upset on their wedding day by the arrival of the East India Trading Company, and its stooge Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander - Pride & Prejudice). Cutler has a history with Captain Jack and craves a particular treasure. He arrests Will and Elizabeth for assisting Jack's escape and in exchange for their freedom sends Will to find Jack and recover a certain artefact.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMeanwhile Jack isn't having a good day either. While trying to find a well hidden bottle of rum in his cargo hold he stumbles upon a ghost from the past, Will's long dead father. Jack once made a bargain with the cursed captain Davy Jones and now his time is up. Davy Jones wants Jack's soul and he is coming for him.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAs Will and Jack's paths come together we learn more of Jack's murky past and the adventure begins. Shifting loyalties, past crimes and cursed debts surround the characters and as doom moves in upon them their relationships will be stretched and their bravery tested.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAt the beginning of the review I mentioned that the Pirate genre had lain dormant until </i>'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl'. That movie was a breath of fresh air and with the combination of action, great comedy and a perfect cast it hit the nail right on the head. Sadly the freshness that made the first film so great has now worn off. Luckily the cast remains great (except for one wooden exception).\r\n</p><p>\r\nOnce again Johnny Depp makes the greatest impression and this time round his character is moved more toward centre stage. A little darker than the original, <i>Dead Man's Chest</i> shows the more self preserving and despicable side of Jack and this makes for a more questionable hero. Kiera Knightley has also been given a more substantial role and, although often irritating, her character does evolve onscreen unlike her co-star Bloom.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOther critics have already berated Bloom and commented upon his wooden performance. Not to add to his woes he is on rather poor form in this movie. He has the looks but lacks the anger that his character needs. Kingdom of Heaven demonstrated that Bloom can act, this film does not, maybe the fault rests with the director or the script but either way this is not a career highlight.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAdding to the already impressive cast, Brit actor Bill Nighy (Underworld Evolution) is the new foe as Davy Jones, a captain who sold his soul to the devil and the sea and is now a strange human/squid mix. Despite the prosthetics you can still detect Nighy's singular voice and he manages to present real menace despite having a silly tentacle crowded face. Additional Brit talent, Tom Hollander, as the self serving and manipulative Cutler Beckett, provides good evidence of 'small man syndrome' by bringing otherwise powerful opponents down to his modest height by blackmail and position power. Finally praise should also go to Naomie Harris (After the Sunset), in reality a beautiful woman, who plays a grungy Caribbean witch. \r\n</p><p>\r\n<i>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest</i> is packed with action and adventure, well choreographed sword fights and a dash of horror. The film is darker than its predecessor but still crams in a good deal of comedy. The action sequences are impressive, if sometimes silly, and the darker aspects of the plot do build nicely. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSimilarly to its predecessor, this film feels long and in a movie that doesn't really add any more to the genre the added run time begins to show. This film would have won a fourth star if they managed to shed 20 minutes from the rather slow second act. Saying that it is still fun and as it ends with a great hook to the third movie, people will be eager for the final chapter.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	323	2011-03-26
324	1	15	\N	Superman Returns	<p>\r\nFrom the moment the 1970s inspired credits swoop across the screen and John Williams' barnstorming theme tune reaches its crescendo it is clear that director Bryan Singer's 2006 rebirth of Superman is deeply reverent of both Richard Donner's original 1978 film and of the world's most famous superhero himself.\r\n</p><P>\r\nSinger had been preparing to shoot the final film in the X-Men franchise when the opportunity came to direct this, his dream project. What chance did Wolverine and Storm stand against the Man of Steel himself?\r\n</p><P>\r\nRepeatedly Superman descends from the air posing like Jesus on the cross and bathed in a glorious light. When his fate hangs in the balance the world comes to a stop and pilgrims swarm the scene. At times you can't help but feel the director is perhaps a little too much in awe of a character who wears his pants over his trousers.\r\n</p><P>\r\nVirtual unknown Brandan Routh shoulders the responsibility of playing this iconic hero without apparent difficulty while his portrayal of Superman's milder alter ego, Clark Kent, is so reminiscent of Christopher Reeves' performance you could swear the great man was still alive in the role.\r\n</p><P>\r\nThe plot cleverly dispenses with the better best forgotten events of the later Superman sequels and sets its stall up at some point after Superman II. Five years have past since Krypton's last son has been seen in the skies above Metropolis, during which time he has travelled back to the remains of his home world to look for answers but found only rubble.\r\n</p><P>\r\nSuperman crash lands in the same Kansas field he did as a child but those who were once close to him have moved on with their lives. Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth - Blue Crush) is now mother to a young son and has a loving fianc Richard (James Marsden - X-Men) waiting at home for her. She has also been awarded the Pulitzer Prize for an article entitled 'Why the world doesn't need Superman."\r\n</p><P>\r\nLittle does she realise, however, how quickly mankind will need Superman again. Clark Kent hasn't even been back at his desk at the Daily Planet a day before planes are plummeting from the skies while, lurking out of sight, Lex Luther is released from prison and scheming world domination.\r\n</p><P>\r\nWith all the main players established, you could expect the film to kick into high gear, but faster than a speeding bullet is a phrase sadly not applicable to the running time of this incarnation of Superman. It clocks in at a lengthy two and half hours, of which the last forty-five minutes certainly pose a challenge to anyone equipped with a less than elasticised bladder.\r\n</p><P>\r\nJust when the tension, special effects and jaw dropping action should be forcing audience members' eyeballs to the back of their skulls, the film literally nosedives into the sea. Luther's evil plan is certainly nutty but it never feels like anyone is ever at serious jeopardy from it. The humdrum rescues that follow can't match the kinetic drama of the crashing aeroplane earlier in the film and the presence throughout of Lois' cute kid is a reminder of the film's major dramatic misstep.\r\n</p><P>\r\nModern comic book films that have proved to be big hitters at the box office are those that have stressed the all too human emotions of their larger than life protagonists. Brian Singer himself enjoyed much success by adopting this very approach with his two X-Men pictures. Unfortunately Superman is a bit of a blank slate in terms of character. He usually just flies about in between tentative romantic moments with Lois Lane, hardly a great source of angst for big blue.\r\n</p><P>\r\nSinger, therefore, throws a big spanner in their relationship to give his hero something to mope about. That spanner comes in the shape of the wide eyed child that Lois has produced, apparently with a little help from her fianc, during the five years Superman was away. The kid proves to be the film's Kryptonite as he sucks the momentum from entire scenes and just frankly gets in the way.\r\n</p><P>\r\nKevin Spacey (Beyond the Sea), meanwhile, does the exact opposite and proves an inspired choice that even shades Gene Hackman's performance as the original Lex Luther. His accomplice, however, doesn't quite match up with Parker Posey (Blade Trinity) proving more of an irritant than the light relief she is intended to be.\r\n</p><P>\r\nAlthough this superhero flick never kicks into top gear, some of the film's quieter moments are nicely handled, particularly the roof top rendezvous between the two leads that sees the pair soar around the huge revolving globe of the Daily Planet building. Beautifully created images such as these litter the film and are what most linger in the memory when the credits role.\r\n</p><P>\r\nSuperman Returns can't be described as a triumph, falling short of Richard Donner's classic original. Singer and his young stars have conjured enough magic moments to make the film worth watching, but perhaps it might be better to let Superman continue to live on in his original comic book medium rather than returning to the cinema again.\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	324	2011-03-26
325	1	20	\N	Stormbreaker	<p>A fourteen-year-old kid with special abilities learns that an evil force has killed his family. Summoned into a fantastic world filled with eccentric characters, he must uncover the truth in time to save the world. Sound familiar? No wands or wizards here, instead its gadgets and spies. No broomsticks or undead sorcerers, instead bicycles and a vengeful cross dressing computer magnate.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBased on the first in a series of popular children's books from author Anthony Horowitz, Stormbreaker follows nave, yet gifted, teenager Alex Rider (Alex Pettyfer) who learns that his uncle Ian (Ewan McGregor - The Island) was a spy and has been murdered by enemies who seek to attack the UK. Unbeknown to Alex, his uncle's insistence that he learn rock climbing, karate, shooting, and half a dozen languages was not for purely benign reasons; he was actually training Alex to follow in his footsteps.\r\n</p><p>\r\nQuickly recruited into British secret service by the Machiavellian head of MI6, Mr Alan Blunt (Bill Nighy - Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest), Alex undergoes rigorous training with special forces before being sent undercover to the factory of an American computer mogul, Darrius Sayle (Mickey Rourke - Sin City) who may be plotting something sinister. \r\n</p><p>\r\nArmed with gadgets and his fighting abilities Alex, under the guise of a computer nerd, takes a tour of the factory and as expected uncovers a devilish plot. Discovered sneaking around by eccentric PR manager Nadia Vole (Missi Pyle - Charlie and the Chocolate Factory), Alex's cover is blown and he must escape with the truth and try to save the day. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThis film will undoubtedly be compared to the <i>Harry Potter</i> movies due to the similar story structure, albeit the world of magic is replaced with gadgets. If you actually compare the movies you highlight the prime reasons why Stormbreaker doesn't achieve a fourth star. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhereas HP4 had an insane black cloaked villain in the form of Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes - The Constant Gardener) with snake like features and erratic mood swings, Stormbreaker has Darrius, a walking fashion disaster with hair extensions and really bad eyeshadow. While Fiennes genuinely scared people, Rourke just makes you laugh as he puts on the hammiest performance since William Shatner's farewell dialogue in <i>Star Trek 6</i>. \r\n</p><p>\r\nOn the upside though, teenage girls will probably prefer deep voiced blond spy Pettfyer's model-like looks to the grungy specky image of Daniel Radcliffe's boy wizard. Essentially a 'Bond movie' for kids, the film may attract a wider audience of young people who fear being labelled 'nerdy' when they go to see Harry Potter.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn the central role, Pettfyer has boyish good looks and carries off his action scenes well. However, when he is not fighting five fully grown men or parachuting out of a helicopter, he is rather dull, moody and sullen. In his defence though, that may be due to his character's profile or the fact that he is a relative newcomer to the big screen. Rourke, on the other hand, has no excuse. He may have been told to ham it up but this is plain silly. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe rest of the acting is fairly good with great actors such as McGregor, Stephen Fry (V for Vendetta), Robbie Coltrane (Harry Potter) and Andy Serkis (King Kong) being given almost cameo roles while the majority of scenes surround young adequate Pettfyer, hammy villain Rourke and pointless Alicia Silverstone (Beauty Shop). Luckily Nighy offers some moments of brilliance as the out-of-touch head of MI6 with a heart of stone, and Pyle offers wit and absurd action as the tall deranged villainess Nadia Vole. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThis film is good entertainment and may even be the beginning of a franchise. Sadly it doesn't live up to its impressive advert. Recommended for fans of the Harry Potter movies, James Bond movies and the lesser known but clearly inspirational <i>'Teen Agent'</i>; A 1991 teen comedy/action movie that bears more than a passing resemblance to this particular film.\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	325	2011-03-26
328	1	20	\N	Miami Vice	<p>In 2003, the world was subjected to an average action movie focusing on two dissimilar cops as they take down the head of the illegal drug trade in Miami. The film was <i>Bad Boys II</i> and, although it was great fun with loads of verbal comedy and high octane action, for the most part it was absurd. However it did have a good idea at its core, a clichd idea, but still a good one.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThree years later Michael Mann (Collateral) releases <i><b>'Miami Vice'</i></b>, a big budget gritty thriller based on the 80s television show. The film has a similar story line to BB2 but removes most of the humour to replace it with subtle character development and substitutes the playful car chases for some violent action. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDetectives James "Sonny" Crockett (Colin Farrell - The New World) and Ricardo Tubbs (Jamie Foxx - Jarhead) are investigating a prostitution ring when they receive a call from an old colleague, Alonzo, who is working undercover for the DEA. Alonzo is freaking out because his cover has been blown, probably by a traitor within the DEA, and he knows that time is running out for his family who will fall prey to the mob. While Sonny and Ricardo try to calm Alonzo they realise it's too late for Alonzo's family and on hearing of their death Alonzo tops himself in a rather grizzly fashion within the first ten minutes.\r\n</p><p>\r\nUnsettled and angered by their friend's betrayal from within the DEA, and assisted by their supportive boss Castillo, Sonny and Ricardo meet with the head of the Miami DEA taskforce to find some answers. Instead they are offered a chance to help the DEA track down the drug dealers and hopefully the traitor. They will go off the grid and work deep undercover, deeper than any cops may have worked before, deep enough to find the man behind the whole show, the man pulling the strings from deep within South America.\r\n</p><p>\r\nLike most Michael Mann movies this film is gritty, slow paced, and ultimately realistic. With films such as <i>'Heat'</i>, <i>'The Insider'</i>, <i>'Ali'</i> and <i>'Collateral'</i>, Mann explores his characters more than most of his peers and this can work to the benefit or detriment of the story. Character development sometimes means putting the story on hold. That doesn't matter if the characters connect with the audience who are expecting a slow movie but if they are expecting action it can lose some of the audience's attention. Also Mann's use of handheld camera's and natural lighting makes for a realistic feel that, although great, can become tiresome in some of the darker set pieces.\r\n</p><p>\r\nI am a fan of Mann's movies and was keen to see this film, although I had concerns regarding the story after watching the revealing advert. Once again Mann gets the most from his actors and fills the movie with his unique style so that it sits nicely with his collection of gritty crime thrillers. Sadly the film is not one of his best and this I attribute more to the story than anything else.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe story, strong and well acted as it was, is fundamentally similar to countless undercover coppers in crime capers and although you cannot ever be sure of a happy ending, or what direction the story may take, you do get a sense of dj vu. On the plus side the action is well placed and realistically violent and the movie has a scattering of naughty, but not too indecent, scenes. \r\n</p><p>\r\nColin Farrell returns to the blockbuster movie scene with a mainstream performance as erratic and daring Sonny who, despite having a mullet, manages to seduce the ice queen girlfriend of a Columbian drug baron. Thankfully Jamie Foxx, fully recovered from his turn in Stealth, is witty and ruthless as Ricardo who shows a particularly violent streak when his lover and colleague Trudi (Naomie Harris - Pirates of the Caribbean 2) gets roughed up by the mob. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIn support Barry Shabka Henley (Collateral) is great as the duo's overweight but solid boss Castillo who protects their identity while undercover, Harris stands up well in a rather demanding role as both a sharp negotiator and an abused hostage victim, and Li Gong (Memoirs of a Geisha) is wonderfully frosty as the manipulative business woman Isabella. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAlthough not one of Michael Mann's best films I think Miami Vice will have a greater success than 'Collateral'. I'd recommend this film to fans of <i>'Collateral'</i>, <i>'Heat'</i> and <i>'Bad Boys 2'</i>.</p>	3	2011-03-26	328	2011-03-26
329	1	12	\N	My Super Ex-Girlfriend	<p>While dumping me, an ex pointed out that the majority of love poetry concerns itself with lost love and failed relationships as if this were sufficient reasoning for our split*. However, the actual proportions work out this is not something that has been traditionally reflected by pop music lyrics or films, but the recent release of <i>The Break-Up</i> and My Super Ex-Girlfriend show some attempt at redressing the imbalance of the latter. Is it the birth of the anti-romantic comedy? One can only hope.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMatt Saunders (Luke Wilson - The Family Stone) has a knack of attracting insane women, and it seems like his new girlfriend, Jenny Johnson (Uma Thurman - Prime), is another one to add to the list. Except this girlfriend has super-powers, and when Matt dumps her she proceeds to make his life a living hell. So far, so <i>Addicted To Love</i>**. To make matters worse, Matt starts an office romance with his co-worker Hannah (Anna Faris - too many Scary Movie's), thus making Jenny even more enraged. Can Matt convince Jenny not to kill him, or is there a threesome in the offing***?\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn spite of the slight twist to the proceedings, My Super-Ex Girlfriend is simply a romantic comedy with super-hero trappings. It fulfills the usual requirements, such as a quirky supporting cast with better lines than the leads (witness Eddie Izzard as arch-villain Bedlam, or Rainn Wilson as Matt's slimy best friend, Vaughn), a who-do-I-really-love revelation, and of course a happy ending. Nothing new there. Where it succeeds is in the charm of its co-stars, Wilson and Thurman, the aforementioned support, the witty dialogue and some of the outrageous torment that Jenny puts Matt through. The board meeting is one highlight, and the fish...\r\n</p><p>\r\nOne gets the impression that the writer has something against aquatic life, but that could just be me. On that note, I would recommend avoiding the trailer as it does feature a lot of the best scenes.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMindless fare, yes, but enjoyable stuff at that. It may give women some ideas about what they could do to boyfriends who dump them, but men can watch this film safe in the assurance that insane super-heroines don't really exist. \r\n</p><p>\r\n* This isn't the reason I hate romantic comedies. \r\n</p><p>\r\n** A Meg Ryan film where she plays against type as a rabid dumped girlfriend who sets out to ruin her ex's life. \r\n</p><p>\r\n*** There isn't. \r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	329	2011-03-26
330	1	12	\N	Election	<p>The Triad gangs of Hong Kong and China have only come to popular\r\nattention in the last couple of decades - mainly through the efforts\r\nof Hong Kong filmmakers - but have been in existence for over three\r\nhundred years. Originally established to overthrow the Manchurian\r\nrulers of China in the 17th century, the Triad secret society became\r\nfragmented at the turn of the 20th century and gradually moved\r\ntowards criminal activities. Despite losing their patriotic cause,\r\nmany of the traditions and rituals from their beginning have\r\nremained, such as the Wo Shing society's biennial choosing of a new\r\nChairman - a choice made by election.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOf the two eligible candidates, Lok (Simon Yam - <i>Tomb Raider 2</i>) is a consummate politician and the favourite to win. Honourable\r\nand respectful of the Wo Shing's traditions and rules, Lok is always\r\nwilling to help out his fellow Triad members whatever their problem.\r\nBig D (Tony Leung Kar-Fai), on the other hand, is brash and\r\ndomineering, and is willing to openly flaunt tradition in order to\r\nwin. When Lok is elected Chairman, Big D threatens an internal war by\r\nattempting to steal the Wo Shing's symbol of leadership, the Dragon's\r\nHead Baton from under Lok's nose. Lok cannot officially become\r\nChairman without the baton and Big D knows that this is one tradition\r\nthat cannot be broken.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAs a warning for aficionados of Hong Kong bullet-ballet flicks, at no\r\npoint do guns appear. Though violence does feature, this is not an\r\naction film. Instead the film is largely dialogue driven and strives\r\nfor a realistic portrayal of the politics of the situation between\r\nthe Triad underlings, their bosses, their lawyers and the atypically\r\nineffective police.\r\n</p><p>\r\nA welcome change of pace from the usual plotless action fare from\r\nHong Kong, <i>Election</i> is very good but not without faults. The\r\ninteractions within the different levels of the society is depicted\r\nwell, but at such a pace that it is difficult to get a grasp of the\r\nmotivations (and sometimes the names!) of any characters aside from\r\nthe central pair of Lok and Big D. Luckily both Yam and Leung Kar-Fai\r\nare skilled actors and bring out their respective personas well, even\r\nif Leung Kar-Fai does veer rather too closely to parody. The chase\r\nfor the Dragon's Head Baton in the latter half of the film is\r\nconfusing simply because it's hard to discern who is working for\r\nwhom. This is perhaps intentional since the confusion extends to the\r\ncharacters themselves, to the point where one underling is in the\r\nprocess of beating someone to death with a huge log before the pair\r\nrealise that they are working for the same man. Intentional perhaps,\r\nbut misguided when it makes significant events difficult to follow\r\nand to work through their consequences.\r\n</p><p>\r\n<i>Election</i> is a refreshing film from Hong Kong that shows that\r\nthe industry is not completely mired in the now-intellectually void\r\ngenres of action, horror and comedy. It's not the out-and-out classic\r\nthat it has been made out to be, but it is a film that makes you\r\nthink and that alone makes it worthy of being seen in this current\r\nera of dumbed down cinema.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	330	2011-03-26
332	1	15	\N	United 93	<p>On a day in history where so many people described what they saw as if something from a film, it was inevitable that the terrible events of September 11th 2001 would be dramatised on the big screen, but how soon is too soon? \r\n</p><p>\r\nIn America the question of whether director Paul Greengrass' (The Bourne Supremacy) depiction of the events onboard flight United 93 should have been made, less than five years after the day itself, has coloured much of the public response towards the picture. \r\n</p><p>\r\nLooking beyond this controversy, however, I would describe the film as the most significant, and successful, release of the year. With a narrative that follows the morning's unfolding attacks in practically real time, Greengrass' hand held camera seats you among the forty or so passengers whose eventual fate lay in a field in Pennsylvania and also among the men and women of U.S Air Traffic Control as they struggled to comprehend the unthinkable. \r\n</p><p>\r\nMany people will undoubtedly be put off from watching what they imagine to be a 'depressing' film but oddly, despite the obvious tragedy, this is never the overwhelming feeling the film provokes. You are never given a moment to dwell on the larger repercussions. Events move so quickly. The film's structure has more in common with a thriller combined with the all-seeing observation of a documentary. \r\n</p><p>\r\nUnited 93 is the most visceral cinematic experience since the first twenty minutes of Saving Private Ryan except Greengrass sustains this momentum for the entire ninety minutes. He doesn't muddy the events by putting a political spin on the narrative or focusing on characters. There are no passengers who stand out above the rest and at the film's conclusion they all remain the strangers they did at the start. \r\n</p><p>\r\nClearly many of the particulars that take place on the plane can never be known for certain but with help from the victim's relatives tiny observations, such as the likely reading material their loved ones might have had with them on the flight, creates as authentic a picture as possible. The emotional phone calls of those trapped on the plane also filled in some of the gaps as to what took place as the plane was taken over, but other elements are pure speculation. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSince United 93 never made it all the way to Washington, the hijackers intended target can never be known but the filmmakers show it to be the Capital Building. The final fifteen minutes, as the passengers discover the fate of the other planes hijacked that day and begin to formulate their plan to retake the plane, is among the most intense cinema I have ever seen. However, it is the moment where the New York Air Traffic Controllers wonder why the plane they are tracking has disappeared from radar as the North Tower of the World Trade Centre smokes on the skyline behind them that most lingers in the memory. It won't be too long before the story of those trapped in the upper floors of the towers is brought to the screen as well.\r\n</p>	5	2011-03-26	332	2011-03-26
333	1	12	\N	Renaissance	<p>Paris - 2054. Scientist Ilona Tasuiev has been kidnapped and her\r\nemployer wants her back at any cost. Captain Karas of Section K is\r\nassigned the task of retrieving her, and gradually pieces together the\r\nreasons behind her disappearance, reasons that are linked to her\r\nresearch into progeria and the pharmaceutical company Avalon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Renaissance</i>'s proper beginning is a long tracking shot that\r\nstarts high above the city before plunging down past skyscrapers, aerial canals, and densely packed apartment complexes to the streets below. It's a dizzying introduction to this futuristic Paris that sets the tone for the rest of the film - visuals over story, style over substance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using motion-captured actors coupled with three-dimensional CGI\r\nbackgrounds, Paris is re-imagined by director Christian Volckman in\r\na striking chiaroscuro black and white. Though <i>Sin City</i>\r\nreached cinemas before Volckman's film, <i>Renaissance</i>'s visual style is informed by Frank Miller's original comics, and its stark, expressionistic contrast between light and darkness is a more faithful\r\nrepresentation of Miller's vision. This contrast has the side-\r\neffects of making it difficult to discern details and flattening\r\nout the distinctive features of the actors' faces, yet it is a\r\nvivid realisation that provokes the imagination.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIf the substance had matched the style, then <i>Renaissance</i>\r\nwould have been an outright classic, but unfortunately the film is\r\nnot without its flaws. The story is unsatisfactory, a conspiracy\r\nplot that unfolds predictably and ends in a hurried mess, and its\r\nscience-fictional elements are almost entirely peripheral, there to\r\nallow the inclusion of anime-esque architecture and gadgets\r\nborrowed from other films. The choice of an English dub was wise,\r\nallowing one to focus on the imagery rather than sub-titles, but\r\nthe performances are lacklustre and lack emotional impact. Daniel\r\nCraig (Munich) as Barthelemy is particularly to blame, but then the more respectable Ian Holm (Lord of War) as Jonas and Jonathan Pryce (The New World) as Paul do themselves no favours either.\r\n</p><p>\r\n<i>Renaissance</i> is truly a case of style over substance, but the\r\nstyle quotient is high enough to recommend the film over its varied\r\nfaults and it is good to see such impressive animation work from a\r\ncountry other than Japan. Here's hoping that Volckman has more such\r\nvisions in his head, and that next time he gets a more worthy story.\r\n</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	333	2011-03-26
335	1	15	\N	Hard Candy	<p>Hayley has been flirting with stranger Jeff in a chat room on the internet. After some suggestive banter they agree to meet up face to face for the first time in a caf and discover a mutual interest in music. Hayley invites herself back to Jeff's house to listen to a CD. Jeff is 32, Hayley is only 14-years-old and one of them doesn't realise just how much jeopardy they are in.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAnyone expecting Hard Candy to realistically explore the subject of paedophiles living within the community, or to consider child safety on the internet, will be surprised by a very different film. This strictly popcorn thriller may have pretensions at serious drama but its central premise revolves around an unlikely and sensationalist twist to the obvious girl in peril tale. \r\n</p><p>\r\nOnce back at his stylish bachelor pad, decorated with candid shots of teenage models, Jeff has no problem pouring drinks for the underage girl, but after a few spirits prepared by Hayley it is he who slumps into unconsciousness. This is a film where the wolf finds out to his cost that he isn't the only predator out hunting. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe entire viewing experience is about as comfortable as sitting on broken glass. The first thirty minutes as the child sends out every inappropriate signal you can imagine and the adult laps each one up with relish, succumbing to her every wish, is just nauseating. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe next hour, during which Jeff finds himself tied to a succession of household furnishings, is equally squirm inducing as the flesh crawling attempts at seduction give way to an extended sequence in which the 14-year-old girl attempts to castrate a conscious and unwilling patient without any anaesthetic. None of the operation is shown up on screen but the scene is shrivelling enough anyway. \r\n</p><p>\r\nBoth leads are excellent with Patrick Wilson (The Alamo) avoiding the obvious social misfit stereotype that men associated with child abuse tend to be portrayed as and Ellen Page (X Men 3) comes across convincingly as both an innocent teenager and a conniving loon. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe film's greatest asset is clearly the ambiguity of the two leads' actions. Is Jeff really a sex offender who is getting what he deserves or is Hayley simply psychotic and has fixated on an innocent man? This intriguing question haunts every action that the two protagonists take and is something that will surely split the audiences' loyalties. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSadly the final revelation of exactly which of the pair is culpable is revealed without fanfare as if there was never any question of who was deserving of our sympathies. This disappointing finale does undermine much of the good work done earlier in the film and begs the question as to whether it was worth sitting through so many shocking moments for an ending that certainly doesn't.\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	335	2011-03-26

She is the kind of girl everyone hates just because of how lucky she is.  Ashley never needs to worry about getting caught in the rain or winning on scratch cards, her life is just perfect!\r\n</p><p>\r\nSwitch to Jake (Chris Pine - The Princess Diaries 2), he is the complete opposite to Ashley.  He has a constant bad luck cloud hanging over him and his list of misfortune is endless.  Not only is he an accident prone klutz with a dead end janitor job but he is also a failing wannabe music manager for Brit group McFly.  Things never seem to go his way.\r\n</p><p>\r\nJake is desperately trying to vie for the attention of music big shot Damon (Faizon Love - Torque) so he may convince him to hear the band's music.  Meanwhile Ashley with minimal efforts finds herself promoted and chosen to host Damon's masquerade bash.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAs fate would have it, Ashley and Jake (who have masked their identities at the ball) end up at the same party.  Destiny brings them together for a dance and a cheeky kiss.  Unbeknown to either of them, their chance meeting and subsequent kiss has switched their luck.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAshley's life takes a sudden turn for the worse.  She ends up in jail and is fired from her job.  For Jake, on the other hand, life is 'sweet' and after saving Damon's life he is given a swanky new 'crib' with all the latest mod cons and an assistant who craves his attention when she is not taking erotic massage classes.  Not only has he won a record deal for his band but he has also won notoriety with the female population.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAshley soon figures out that something isn't right and she recalls a warning from a tarot card reader at the party.  She pays her a visit to try and find out how she can reverse her misfortune and discovers that the only way to regain her luck is to kiss her masked man but first she has to find out who he is!\r\n</p><p>\r\nLohan is on form in her normal teen chick flick role and relative newcomer Pine backs her up well as her clumsy love interest.  Big praise must go to funny man Love who adds spice and laughter to the film.

337	1	20	\N	Little Fish	<p>Following a string of blockbuster movies, actors Cate Blanchett (The Aviator) and Hugo Weaving (V for Vendetta) return to Australia for a gritty real life drama along with fellow Australasians Sam Neil (The Dish) and Martin Henderson (Bride & Prejudice). \r\n</p><p>\r\nTracy Heart (Cate Blanchett) is a reformed drug addict who has managed to clean up her life after a rebellious youth. She enjoys swimming and has managed to hold down a steady job for four years and hopes soon to manage her own business. She is still friends with her estranged father figure Lionel (Hugo Weaving), a former footballer and addict, despite her mother's disdain, and hopes to help Lionel kick his habit.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter a fun evening at a school reunion, Tracy's life is about to hit a small crisis. As part of his birthday celebrations, Tracy's brother Ray (Martin Henderson) invites home Tracy's old boyfriend Justin (Dustin Nguyen - Virtuosity). Justin is more than Tracy's old beau, he is also the man responsible for Ray's traumatic leg amputation and also a former druggie. \r\n</p><p>\r\nJustin's arrival reawakens emotions in Tracy that she has tried to bury for years. As her business dreams start to slip away from her, she watches as Ray sinks deeper into the drug trade and Lionel's recovery falters. The temptation to revert to drugs, the crumbling lives of her family and friends, and the stress of her fragile new life all combine to test Tracy in one of the worst weeks of her life.\r\n</p><p>\r\nI must admit this type of dramatic fly-on-the-wall drama really isn't my usual cup of tea. I visit the cinema to escape the harsh reality of life and the bleak prospect for this small rock in space. I do not visit the flicks to be dragged along the emotional rollercoaster of a reforming drug addict. No wonder then that one of my least favourite movies of all time is <i>'Trainspotting'</i>. Despite this phobia for reality, in this instance I found the story compelling and I found myself willing Tracy to succeed.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBoth Blanchett and Weaving were on top form in this gritty slice of life on the border between drug addiction and drug freedom. Blanchett as the lead demonstrated again that she is one of the strongest actresses on the world stage. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe story is very visceral and the audience has more sympathy for Tracy than other movie recovering drug addicts such as Renton in Trainspotting. As you watch her fight the flow that tries to drag her back to the bleak world of drugs, you want her to fight through and find the clean life she dreams of. By comparison, Weaving's character Lionel is still in the grip of his addiction and after seeing him in iconic blockbuster roles such as Agent Smith, Elrond or V, it is odd to see him play someone so sleazy and destroyed. Weaving gives another strong performance and one that may make people in the west finally realise how strong an actor he really is.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOverall I feel the film was a well crafted glimpse into the life of a recovered druggie fighting to find a new life despite all the factors against her. It should win praise from the critics even if it doesn't earn a huge box office taking. I anticipate this film will have only a limited release in the UK but hope that the film will have a strong success.</p>\r\n\r\n	4	2011-03-26	337	2011-03-26
338	1	15	\N	District 13	<p>With areas of crime-ridden France becoming ungovernable by 2010, the authorities have withdrawn basic services to the worst slums and simply walled them in. \r\n</p><p>\r\nOne such notorious place, District B13, is home to sprightly Leito (David Belle) who keeps the rampant crime and drugs that infest the rest of the ghetto away from his clean and safe apartment block. \r\n</p><p>\r\nLeito's determination to do the right thing however causes him to cross paths with gangland boss Taha (Bibi Naceri), whose thugs come calling when Leito destroys a shipment of his drugs. \r\n</p><p>\r\nForced to flee with his sister Lola (Dany Verissimo), Leito turns to the police for help but the cynical officers betray him to Taha. Circumstances change however when, six months later, a stolen neutron bomb ends up among the urban jungle of District B13. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe police need a guide for the agent who is to be sent in to disarm it and Leito, now locked up in prison, is just the man for the job. This thin slice of plot is really just an excuse for some very satisfying action scenes during which David Belle, co-founder of the free running movement, astounds the audience with his agility and gracefulness while taking no prisoners among the hired guns and killers out to get him. \r\n</p><p>\r\nCyril Raffaelli (Taxi 2), a former stuntman, co-stars as trustworthy cop Damien and he also puts his abilities to good use helping to produce probably the most exciting and innovative action film made in Europe for a long, long time. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe most breathtaking sequence unfortunately takes place at the films' start and is never matched again but Leito's energetic escape from a group of pursuers across the balconies and rooftops of his estate is unlikely to be matched by anyone else either. How the man doesn't break every bone in his body during this one five-minute sequence is simply beyond me? \r\n</p><p>\r\nLooking past the action, the storyline is basic to say the least and the script is not going to win any awards either but both leads put in good performances that belie their lack of real acting experience. \r\n</p><p>\r\nOccasionally the film rather clumsily tries to comment on the social realities of living in France's poor suburbs today but for most of the time it just keeps to its main strength; showcasing the two leads' ability to defy gravity. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWith the majority of the British film industry focused on churning out comedies, romantic or otherwise, the only action flicks the United Kingdom now produce are the big budget franchises that are filmed over here with Hollywood's bucks. \r\n</p><p>\r\nBy contrast, the French film industry has managed to produce an original home grown feature on a limited budget that isn't targeted squarely at kids. Hopefully the success of District 13 can encourage filmmakers on this side of the channel to take a few risks and put more ambitious projects into production.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWith a story similar to the cult classic <i>'Escape from New York'</i>, this film is recommended for fans of frantic realistic action like that seen in <i>\r\nOng-Bak</i>.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	338	2011-03-26
339	1	16	\N	The Break Up	<p>Based on the first stages of the psychology of interpersonal relationships, most conventional romantic comedies tend to focus on the formation and maintenance of relationships whereas this movie focuses on the latter stages of its dissolution.\r\n</p><p>\r\nA chance meeting brings together art appreciator Brooke (Jennifer Aniston - Rumor Has It) and bus tour guide Gary (Vince Vaughn - The Wedding Crashers).  The couple fall in love and move into a condo together where they live in idyllic bliss. How long can this happiness last? Brooke prefers art and the ballet while Gary likes to laze about watching sports and playing computer games.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSoon their differences start to grate on each other and a simple mistake over buying lemons turns into a flaming row.  The couple's frustrations rise to the surface and they even throw family insults at each other in the heat of the moment.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIt gets to the point where Brooke, disappointed at Gary's lack of contribution to their life together, calls off the relationship in the hope it may inspire him to make an effort to change.  With each side refusing to bite the bullet and move out, the couple end up co-habiting in their own designated corners of the condo until it is sold.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nTheir idiosyncrasies and bad habits continue to irritate each other so the pair starts to make their living space uninhabitable in a bid to drive the other side out.  Brooke lets her tone deaf camp brother Richard (John Michael Higgins - Fun with Dick and Jane) use her room for singing practice while Gary invites his buddies round for a sneaky game of pool.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe stress of the break-up starts to take its toll on Brooke and Gary's daily routines and work life.  It has hit Brooke hardest so in order to get back to normal working life she tries to make peace with Gary.  Will it all end happily or will the couple go their separate ways?\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe Break-Up boasts a great line up of promising talent.  Surprisingly, Aniston puts in a commendable performance after an overkill of poor rom-coms in recent years.  Her comedic support comes in the unexpected form of Justin Long (Herbie Fully Loaded) as her long haired camp assistant, Christopher.\r\n</p><p>\r\nVaughn is his usual crowd-pleasing self with some hilarious one-liners.  He gets excellent back-up from Jon Favreau (Wimbledon) as his crazy friend Johnny, who leads a hilarious scene about beating up a potential suitor.  Praise should also go to Higgins for his entertaining singing outbursts.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe Break-Up superseded my original expectations.  The acting was good, the content was funny and even the emotional scenes made me shed a tear or two.  Fans of <i>'A Lot Like Love'</i>, <i>'War of the Roses'</i> and <i>'How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days'</i> are sure to love this movie. \r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	339	2011-03-26
341	1	20	\N	Nacho Libre	<p>In a remote Mexican monastery a young plump lad named Nacho dreams of becoming a famous wrestler but fighting is unholy and his punishment is a lifetime of servitude in the monastery's kitchen. \r\n</p><p>\r\nFast forward to the modern day and Nacho (Jack Black - King Kong) is still in the kitchen, he is a monk that caters for the monastery's young orphans. With little money the orphanage cannot afford fine ingredients and he worries for the orphans. He isn't a brilliant monk and his curious dreams and incompetence means he is disrespected by his peers. Down trodden, Nacho tries to find happiness in the smaller things in life.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThen one fateful day he spots a famous wrestler in the local town and is amazed at the respect and adoration the masked man receives by the crowd. His old passion for wrestling is reawakened, especially when he sees that he could win loadsa pesos if he wins. So in secret he starts to train himself and recruits a skinny Gollum-like thief, Esqueleto (Hctor Jimnez) to be his tag partner.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe fat Nacho and the skinny Esqueleto run, through melons and bees nests at each other, all in the hopes of gaining fitness. Then on the night of the fight they are pasted by their opponents. But, to their surprise, they still win some money. No matter if you win or lose, you get paid something. With money in their pockets, Esqueleto smartens himself up and Nacho treats the monastery to some proper food.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter their initial bout, they carry on competing but all too soon the fame goes to Nacho's head and instead of fine food for needy kids, he buys sexy shoes and clothes to try and impress the woman of his dreams, Sister Encarnacin (Ana de la Reguera). Despite looking the part, Nacho still cannot win a fight or win the girl. Suddenly things start to slide downhill for our hero.\r\n</p><p>\r\nCan the mustachioed wrestler find the goodness in his heart and faith in the divine to purge his vanity and defeat the vile wrestling champion Ramses (Cesar Gonzalez) who recently offended the orphans? \r\n</p><p>\r\nDirector Jared Hess (Napoleon Dynamite) once again directs a gentle and hilarious movie about the trials of an honourable, if utterly incompetent, hero. Instead of a geeky youth trying to find social acceptance, it is a warrior monk trying to find fresh vegetables. The format is similar but the stories are very different. Again, Hess manages to draw out fine performances from his primary cast including a number of relative unknowns at centre stage.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe duo of Jack Black and Hctor Jimnez is like a Latino Laurel and Hardy. Although not Mexican himself, Jack Black is convincing in the role of Nacho and instantly brings his energetic comedy to the screen with an early culinary mishap. In support, angelic Ana de la Reguera provides beauty to the otherwise barren surroundings and could easily find lasting fame in Hollywood. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThis film may not boast the most original story but it has got plenty of genuine laughs and introduces a nice array of eccentric characters. Think of <i>Nacho Libre</i> as a mix of Napoleon Dynamite and <i>School of Rock</i>.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	341	2011-03-26
342	1	20	\N	A Scanner Darkly	<p><i>"This is a world getting progressively worse. Can we not agree on that?" </i><b>Barris</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have you ever looked at people around you, the world around you, and thought there was something wrong with reality? Have you ever daydreamed an alternate life where your job, your friends, even your own personality is so very different? If you have ever pondered, philosophically, what reality is and not been afraid of the shadowy truths around us, then you will enjoy 'A Scanner Darkly' and the works of Philip K. Dick. Wow, maybe that sounded a bit too deep.\r\n</p><p>\r\n'A Scanner Darkly' is a thought provoking movie that looks at the blurred line between harsh reality and drug induced paranoia. There is humour and there is despair. There is art and there is a message. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWriter Philip K. Dick was one of the most prolific and imaginative science fiction writers of the twentieth century and has provided source material for some of the greatest sci-fi movies. Through his life Philip K. Dick suffered personal tragedy and numerous bouts of mental illness. These factors were infused in his writing and a common theme in his stories is the perception of reality and what it is to be human.\r\n</p><p>\r\nHis novel <i>'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'</i> was famously adapted for the big screen by Ridley Scott and became <i>'Blade Runner'</i>, arguably one of the top ten science fiction movies of all time. Other books from Philip K. Dick have inspired <i>'Total Recall'</i>, <i>'Screamers'</i>, <i>'Paycheck'</i> and <i>'Minority Report'</i>. Following this trend, and in line with modern concerns over a growing drug culture and corrupt businesses taking over, <i>'A Scanner Darkly'</i> explores the problems of drug culture and personal identity in a world spiraling into madness.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFred (Keanu Reeves - The Lake House) is a dedicated cop, a scanner, who works deep undercover to try and track the source of <i>'Substance-<b>D</b>'</i>, a new highly addictive and destructive drug that is sweeping through America like an epidemic. He works so undercover that even his own colleagues do not know who he is. His target, a dealer named Bob Arctor.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAt the office, Fred adorns a distortion suit that hides his features behind a confusing mix of countless false ones. Someone looking at the suit cannot see the real man beneath, sadly neither can Fred. \r\n</p><p>\r\nBob Arctor is a Substance-D addict and pusher. As the drug takes hold Bob's identity and sense of reality blurs and paranoia kicks in. Little does Bob know that he is the scanner Fred and he is watching himself? These two different people, facets of one human shell, are crumbling and their two worlds, once different, are actually coming together.\r\n</p><p>\r\nLiving with a paranoid quasi-chemist Barris (Robert Downey Jnr. - Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) and a dimwitted fool, Ernie (Woody Harrelson - North Country), Bob tries to get close to new girlfriend Donna (Winona Ryder - Mr. Deeds) and make sense of the confusion that grips his consciousness. Meanwhile Fred watches this group of dregs from a distance hoping to catch the source of Substance-D. In his distortion suit at a scanner console Fred feels similarly disjointed from reality. \r\n</p><p>\r\nUsing a combination of real film and overlaid graphical artwork director Richard Linklater (Bad News Bears) has converted an otherwise normal film format into something more surreal and in keeping with the subject matter. This visual effect, adopted earlier by Linklater in 2001's <i>'A Waking Life'</i>, adds an element of artistic flair to the movie. While it can be argued that the film is essentially an animation, the physical movements and characteristics of each actor are preserved, as is the dialogue.  This filming style, like the film, walks a line between two different forms. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe script, based on Philip K. Dick's novel of the same name, is laced with great humour and its glimpses into low life existence is at once reminiscent of <i>'Pulp Fiction'</i> while the reality distorting science fiction remains more akin to <i>'Blade Runner'</i>. \r\n</p><p>\r\nKeanu Reeves puts in a good performance as the polar identities Fred and Bob, fighting addiction while searching for reality in a drug-induced landscape. While Reeves contemplates some of the heavier aspects of the story, Downey Jnr., Harrelson and Rory Cochrane (Hart's War) offer hilarity as three eccentric addicts constantly bickering and hallucinating.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nIn one particular scene where the group debates the dubious fate of some missing bicycle gears I was almost having an asthma attack for laughing so much. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThese high moments (pardon the pun) allow a great balance against the heavier messages about drug addiction and the corruption of power. Some dialogue will have you in stitches while the story itself may leave you... dazed.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMy own mind is torn on how to rate this movie.  Is it a stylish science fiction masterpiece or a drug addled disjointed quasi animation? I am leaning towards the former though the think-phobic masses may lean towards the latter.\r\n</p>	4	2011-03-26	342	2011-03-26
343	1	15	\N	Lady in the Water	<p>Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti - Sideways) leads a solitary life working as the handyman at a run down apartment complex called The Cove. While the colourful residents of the building go about their lives Cleveland exists in the background, quietly going about his mundane job of keeping the building in working order. \r\n</p><p>\r\nOne night, however, Cleveland's life is irrevocably changed when he hears splashing coming from the communal swimming pool. After knocking himself unconscious and almost drowning he wakes to find that his saviour is a water nymph called Story (Bryce Dallas Howard - The Village). \r\n</p><p>\r\nThis fairytale creature has travelled into the world of men to change things for the better and, in particular, guide a certain individual who lives in the complex to his destiny. As Cleveland sets out to help Story find the identity of this person, little does he realise that other more dangerous creatures have followed her from her world. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDirector M. Night Shyamalan has achieved a feat few directors have matched. His ability to create both original and mainstream cinematic successes means that it is now his name, and not those of his leading actors, that headline movie posters. Unfortunately Lady in the Water is his first serious misstep. \r\n</p><p>\r\nI have actually rather enjoyed all of the director's past films to varying degrees but this effort doesn't have any idea who it is trying to please. The plot was original conceived by the director during an impromptu bedtime story telling session with his children and frankly, for much of the film, it does feel like Shyamalan is making it up as he goes along. Despite the fact that his own children were the first test audience for the story, it will prove a bore for most kids. The pace is too slow for those who have grown up on a diet of The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. They are also hardly likely to identify with a middle aged leading man who is over weight and suffers from a stutter. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIf, alternatively, Lady in the Water is for grownups Shyamalan has abandoned the central reason that his previous projects such as Unbreakable and Signs were so successful. In each, the film approached a fantastical idea, whether aliens or superheroes, in a completely normal and almost mundane way. The real world foundations of his stories tether the supernatural elements. In Lady in the Water there can be no such suspension of disbelief. While the residents of The Cove seem to instantaneously accept the presence of a fairytale character, not to mention their own role in the prophesised events, the audience merely shakes their head incredulously. \r\n</p><p>\r\nEverything about the premise seems faintly silly and as a result neither tension nor atmosphere, the bread and butter of Shyamalan's earlier work, is mustered. Sketchy and just plain strange characterisation doesn't help either. Story is supposed to be a magic being that provokes feelings of wonder and inspiration to those around her and yet those feelings simply fail to transmit to the audience. Her appearance isn't otherworldly and she is so reticent that her character fades away to the background as Cleveland becomes more assertive. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe eclectic characters that make up The Cove are clearly designed to be a quirky cross section of modern America but few stick in the memory beyond their screen time. In fact, the only supporting character that comes to life is the newly arrived film critic whose amusing arrogance and aloofness is a none too subtle response to those reviewers who have questioned Shyamalan's work in the past. The final casting nail comes with the actor playing Story's principal target for inspiration; a writer whose works will profoundly change the world. Shyamalan casts himself.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	343	2011-03-26
326	1	15	WARNING: fast cars and strong language!	Fast and the Furious - Tokyo Drift	<p>Poor white trash Sean Boswell (Lucas Black - Jarhead) is sitting in his supped up ride outside school, minding his own business, when some hot girl gives him the eye after she catches sight of his enormous engine. Naturally her boyfriend takes offence and before you know it silly Sean is engaged in a suicidal drag race through a construction site with a not terribly picky blonde as the prize. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAs experts in the world of movie car chases are all too aware, arseholes in possession of shiny sports cars that challenge drivers of superficially decrepit shit heaps usually get a shock come the finish line and so it proves here. Our hero Sean is no stranger to street racing and his car is actually a wolf in rusty bodywork. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSean puts the jock in his place but not before wrecking a house made of matchsticks and flipping his car over and over again. The police, despite possessing video evidence of the demolition, can't charge Sean as an adult since he is only 17, which is odd since Lucas Black looks about 25. Instead he is punished by being shipped off to live with his father in Tokyo and rapidly what little logic the film had at its disposal heads off at speed into the sunset. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSean flies all the way across the Pacific to avoid getting caught up in illegal street racing but within 24 hours of arriving he ends up sitting behind the wheel of a car taking part in an illegal street race. What are the chances? In a film as intricately plotted as The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, surprisingly high. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhy exactly dropping Sean into a non-English speaking school on the other side of the world will help his behavioural problems is also a mystery but he rapidly makes acquaintances with Twinkie (Bow Wow - Like Mike), another army brat who takes him to a gathering of lurid sports cars, girls in tiny skirts and guys with over stylised hair. \r\n</p><p>\r\nBy the end of the night Sean has managed to put one car into a concrete wall, pissed off the local mobster's son, become beholden to a mysterious stranger and fallen for the wrong girl, again. So with the preamble out of the way Sean gets to learn a new style of racing from his very own Yoda figure and generally engages in reckless behaviour, \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe car chases are superficially impressive although the novelty of 'drifting' in which cars slide round corners almost rear wheel first soon grows tiresome and you can't help but feel the race participants would get a lot further if they just drove in a straight line.\r\n</p><p>\r\nLambasting the third film in a series that has been nothing but dumb and predictable for also being dumb and predictable is hardly worth the effort. It feels like picking on the fat kid at school who ate dirt in the playground. Where is the challenge? Anyone who watches this film will know exactly what they are letting themselves in for and the fact that they are still sitting in that cinema seat means that an abundance of lingering shots of cars going really fast and of no small amount of leg is exactly what they were looking for. In which case, this film delivers in spades but please remember to drive home safely when you finish curdling your brain.</p>\r\n\r\n	2	2011-03-26	326	2012-03-08
345	1	15	\N	Harsh Times	<p>Director David Ayer describes Harsh Times as a coming of age film but it certainly isn't one along the lines of <i>American Pie</i>. Even residents of Britain's toughest inner cities may find it difficult to identify with the brutality of South Central LA. Violence is rife and intimidation is the principal tool needed to get you through the day.\r\n</p><p>\r\nJim (Christian Bale - Batman Begins) is a Gulf War veteran trying to join the Los Angeles Police Department while his best friend Mike (Freddy Rodriguez - Poseidon) is under pressure from his girlfriend to get any sort of job whatsoever. The plan for the day is for Mike to drop his applications into several prospective companies but when Jim finds out his application to the LAPD has been rejected all he wants to do is get drunk, high and laid.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe meandering adventures of the 'heroes' day of delinquency gives the audience a tough snapshot of life in the ghetto, albeit a similar picture to that seen in Ayer's earlier work as writer of corrupt cop drama <i>Training Day</i>. Along the way we discover that Jim hasn't quite got over his combat experience and seems to instinctively make bad choices, while Mike is easily led and seems to value his friendship with Jim more than his relationship with girlfriend Sylvia (Eva Longoria - Desperate Housewives [TV]).\r\n</p><p>\r\nFor a film that clearly wants to impress you with its gritty realism, it has several flaws that undermine its believability. The protagonists' act like the teenager miscreants of recent British drama <i>Kidulthood</i> but are almost twice their age. Christian Bale is a very fine actor and he is at times excellent here but I just didn't buy him as a 26-year-old inner city hoodlum. He puts on the accent and walks the tough guy walk but his character is simply too old and too intelligent to make a convincing thug. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIt is during the second half of the film, as Jim's militaristic and then ultimately psychotic nature emerges, that Bale begins to shine but even this unwittingly throws up a second problem for the film and its star. As Jim turns violently on former friends without a second's warning, the spectre of Patrick Bateman is invoked. Bale may well always struggle to escape the shadow of his most celebrated role but appearing as a watered down version of that character does neither him nor this film any favours.\r\n</p><p>\r\nTo describe this as a major distraction would be overstating the issue and Bale's performance as Jim reveals several other sides to his character that are quite intriguing, particularly when he plays the role of caring boyfriend to his impoverished Mexican girlfriend who lives on the other side of the border. \r\n</p><p>\r\nJim's attempts to bluff his way through several tests to gain a job with Homeland Security provide the film with a tighter focus that the first hour lacks and also adds a few brief moments of humour. However, just as the future seems to brighten a little for its two lead characters, Jim chooses to self destruct and may well pull Mike down with him.\r\n</p><p>\r\n<i>Harsh Times</i> is a brooding film of barely restrained violence. Its uncompromising portrayal of life in the poor neighbourhoods of Los Angeles may disturb some people but it should not be dismissed as a simple retread of other similarly plotted pictures. This flick has enough fresh elements to make the audience care about at least one of the characters' fates.\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	345	2011-03-26
346	1	16	\N	John Tucker Must Die	<p>In his first stab at the big screen, <i>Desperate Housewives</i> star Jesse Metcalfe plays a serial dater who manages to charm (or should I say, smarm) his way into every girl's heart.\r\n</p><p>\r\nJohn Tucker is the most popular guy in school.  Not only is he the basketball captain but he also has a fantastic bod to match.  What girl could resist?\r\n</p><p>\r\nJohn is an expert 'player' and he has a string of girlfriends falling at his feet.  He never gets caught out thanks to his 'cannot fail' dating tactics.  He never dates girls in the same clique and swears them all to secrecy.\r\n</p><p>\r\nNew girl Kate (Brittany Snow - The Pacifier), practically a nobody at school, observes John's dating techniques from afar with disapproval and surprise.  As an outsider, the way John treats girls horrifies her and she can't understand why they put up with it.\r\n</p><p>\r\nJohn's secret doesn't stay hidden for long and soon the three latest girls he has been dating find out about each other.\r\n</p><p>\r\nInstead of being mad at John, Heather (Ashanti - Coach Carter), Beth (Sophia Bush - One Tree Hill [TV]) and Carrie (Arielle Kebbel - Aquamarine) turn on each other.  It takes outsider Kate to make them realise that they should stop fighting among themselves and get even with John for his cheating ways!\r\n</p><p>\r\nKate has her eye on the other Tucker, John's brother Scott, (Penn Badgley - The Mountain [TV]) who she has struck up a friendship with.  He is definitely more on her intellectual level than John.\r\n</p><p>\r\nKate's intervention spurs the three girls to go after John Tucker and make him 'undatable'.  They are determined to go to all lengths to bring him down and break his heart.\r\n</p><p>\r\nStarring in his first feature film, Metcalfe was suitably cast as the buff and popular school jock, although his role doesn't stretch his acting ability any further than his sexy gardener role in Desperate Housewives.  Snow pulls off a convincing performance as the pretty temptress who has a hidden agenda.  Support from Ashanti, Bush and Kebbel add humour and spice to the love pentagon.\r\n</p><p>\r\nUnlike your typical teen rom-coms, John Tucker Must Die steers away from the norm by setting out to make the cheating jock pay for his indiscretions while bouncing back to turn the situation round in his own favour.  Girls beware!\r\n</p><p>\r\nFans of How to Lose a Guy in 10 days and 10 Things I Hate About You will find this movie a lot of fun.  Recommended for all you independent women out there.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	346	2011-03-26
347	1	15	\N	11.14	<p>Multiple plot threads, a large cast of characters and the central event of a car accident that connects them all? You might be forgiven for thinking I'm describing Paul Haggis' Oscar winning drama Crash, but in fact not only does director Greg Marcks' 11:14 share all these details with its worthy relatives, it also precedes it by almost two years. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDespite kicking around for much longer than any decent film should on the way to getting a British release date, this dark comedy, which originally premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, has no reason to hide away in shame. \r\n</p><p>\r\nBoozy Jack (Henry Thomas - The Gangs of New York) is driving down a rural road not long after 11pm, chatting to his girlfriend via a mobile phone. The drink hasn't helped his concentration and Jack isn't paying enough attention to what he is doing. As the clock strikes 11:14pm he smashes his car into someone while, not far away in the town of Middleton, a second fatal accident takes place at exactly the same time. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter witnessing Jack's frantic and not hugely successful attempt to hide the body at the side of the road, the narrative jumps back in time and the viewpoint changes to that of a group of teenagers diving in to a van, out to cause some mischief around Middleton. \r\n</p><p>\r\nTo go into too much detail about the plot would completely ruin the very nature of the film, although suffice to say that even the smallest action earlier in the evening has repercussions that stretch across the entire night's events. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAll told, the film tells five interrelating stories which culminate with the two crashes at 11:14pm. The structure that the creators have chosen is intriguing enough during the earlier stages of the film but, after the first couple of episodes, while you may not be able to fill in every single blank yourself, you do know the gist of what is going to happen. Particularly since the victim of one of the accidents is revealed far too early and thus rather wastes the opportunity of creating a memorable finale. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter a comparatively uneventful fifteen minutes spent in the company of corpse disposing father Patrick Swayze (Keeping Mum), it comes as a relief to jump to convenience store clerk (Hilary Swank - Million Dollar Baby) before the film is rounded off with a brilliantly conniving segment starring Rachel Leigh Cook (She's All That) as teenage vixen Cheri. While Swank is merely good given her own high standards, Cook is excellent and proves herself to be a capable young actress after slipping off the radar in the years since her brief success in teen comedies. \r\n</p><p>\r\n11:14 is quirky rather than actually funny but for a night of mostly unexpected entertainment this tangled web of double crossing and deceit makes a welcome change from all the sugary summer films filling up the neighbouring screens at the multiplex at the moment.\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	347	2011-03-26
351	1	20	\N	The Sentinel	<p>When I sat down to watch <I>The Sentinel</i> I had hopes that it could be a great fast paced action movie or possibly even a tense thriller. Sadly the movie didn't manage to live up to either expectation.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe basic plot follows a senior secret service agent, Pete Garrison (Michael Douglas - You, Me & Dupree) who gets wind of a possible mole within the service who may be planning to assassinate the President of the United States. As Pete starts to look into the threat he is quickly stitched up by unknown forces who implicate him as the mole.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAt this point the secret service's relentless agent David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland - 24 [TV]), a protg of Pete's who is trying to find the mole, starts to chase his former mentor who he firmly believes could be the traitor. \r\n</p><p>\r\nUndeterred Pete knows that the only way to prove his innocence is to find his informer and expose the traitor before he can kill the main man. Complicating matters is the fact that Pete has been having an affair with the first lady and the traitors are trying to blackmail him. Also his pursuer, David, believes Pete had an affair with his wife and is having difficulty differentiating his own anger from the evidence.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThere is the basis for a great thriller here albeit a well trodden path. Alas, the film focused too much on chasing a man we know to be innocent than building up any sense of threat against the President or any credible suspects. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe actors are forced to play out their career stereotypes using weak clichd characters. Michael Douglas, famed for his 80's erotic thrillers is clearly plugging on a bit so mercifully we don't have to endure any raunchy scenes (except a strange moment when he appears to be eating Kim Basinger's head during a passionate kiss). Similarly, Kiefer Sutherland seems to have walked straight off the set of his popular TV franchise <i>'24'</i> remaining in his 'Jack Bauer' mode. Kim Basinger, an underrated actress, is given barely any screen time while young, hot Eva Longoria (Desperate Housewives [TV]) is only present to offer eye candy as a rookie learning the ropes.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAll in all this was a weak suspense thriller that held some good potential only to dribble it away by stumbling from clich to clich. There wasn't enough action for it to be considered an action movie and there was very little suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat. Saying that it wasn't a complete loss, Eva Longoria is in it after all.\r\n</p><p>\r\nRecommended for fans of the television show <i>24</i>, <i>Enemy of the State</i>, <i>The Fugitive</i> and <i>The Negotiator</i>.</p>  \r\n	2	2011-03-26	351	2011-03-26
352	1	4	\N	Hoodwinked	<p>The traditional story of Little Red Riding Hood leaves young ones with a happy ending, thinking real life always goes right - but they couldn't be more wrong. This film blasts this fantasy out of the water and continues the story where the Brothers Grimm left off. Directors Cory and Todd Edwards have finally taken us behind the scenes shattering our rosy childhood illusions and giving us the real cold hard story.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWhat we never realised was that the original tale was cut at a crime scene. Starting at the end, in true CSI style, Detective Bill Stork (Anthony Anderson  - The Departed) is brought in to investigate a domestic disturbance at Granny's cottage, but finds the list of charges against the suspects mounting up, from breaking and entering to wielding an axe without an license and intent to eat. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAll the main suspects are present, that being the karate kicking Red Riding Hood (Anne Hathaway - The Devil Wears Prada), the adrenaline junkie granny (Glenn Close - The Stepford Wives), a lumbering Woodsman (James Belushi - K9), and the sharp tongued sarcastic Wolf (Patrick Warburton - The Wild), who are then swiftly taken in for questioning. But there is another crime afoot against the woodland folk that runs throughout the film. The primary agenda here is to steal everyone's sweet recipes and drive them out of business. This is headed by the mysterious crime lord, known only as the "Goody Bandit", Mwoah ha ha ha...... \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe film tells the story of how all four came to be in Granny's cottage, unveiling a little more as each character is interrogated, and little things which seem weird from one perspective but make perfect sense when the next character tells their story. \r\n</p><p>\r\nI liked this film, but not passionately, maybe because I didn't really care too much about the characters. Although I was feeling Twitchy with his squeaky voice. My favourite scene was when Twitchy handed Wolf a lit stick of dynamite, and Wolf asked, "What kind of candles are those?" and Twitchy replied pointing at the writing "Dee-na-mee-tay. Must be Italian". \r\n</p><p>\r\nI think half the problem was that I was never quite sure who the target audience was supposed to be. Having fallen in love with <i>Shrek</i> and other Pixar animations, the adult theme was over shadowed by the childish material, and the somewhat primitive two-dimensional artistry of the characters, which gave this movie a slight 1940's feel - think Betty Boo.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAlthough it was funny, I was slightly disappointed as it wasn't as hilarious as I had hoped.  It could be because I was anticipating something up there with <i>Shrek</i> (if you've haven't guessed by now, I'm a Shrek fan), but the bar had been set pretty high - and although the film was all right, the bar barely felt a breeze. And the theme tunes weren't very catchy, verging on the naff. \r\n</p><p>\r\nHoodwinked - an aptly named film as I did feel a little duped! ;-) </p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	352	2011-03-26
354	1	20	\N	C S A Confederate States of America	<p>Looking back through history we can see how civilization today has been shaped by many factors such as innovations and religions but realistically turning points have been based more upon the outcome of wars and conflicts. All those wars, and especially the larger wars, have decided the fate and future of countries and continents and with a bit of imagination you can picture what may have happened if history had favoured the loser. \r\n</p><p>\r\nFollowing the war of independence, the United States became fractured leading to the civil war between the liberal democratic north and the right wing confederacy in the south. History tells us that the north, lead by President Abraham Lincoln, eventually won the American Civil war and the modern day USA is based upon this important turning point. Imagine for a moment what would have happened if the south had won?\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn <i>'C.S.A the Confederate States of America'</i>, a modern mockumentary, director Kevin Willmott explores an alternative history based on a Confederate victory against the Yankees. \r\n</p><p>\r\nFilmed akin to a 'History Channel' documentary, including adverts, C.S.A tells the story of how the Confederacy, with their powerful slave trade, managed to secure funding and support from Europe to topple the liberal Lincoln who was eventually arrested and sent to jail. \r\n</p><p>\r\nVictory against the north, and a booming slave trade, paved the way for an economically stable country with a massive 'near-no-cost' work force. Tax manipulation helped spread the idea of slavery and eventually an attack on Southern America helped expand the Confederacy into a new world empire. \r\n</p><p>\r\nCarrying on in a similar vein, the documentary follows this alternative history through to the modern day and integrates the history of a political family dynasty through three generations to the election campaign of their latest son and heir. The parallels between this fictitious history, and reality, start to become more apparent as the documentary progresses and you do start to wonder how peaceful and loving the USA really is, a point emphasised by the adverts. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThroughout the documentary there are numerous adverts filmed in modern marketing style albeit for incredibly non-PC products. These adverts have a particular poignancy as in the final five minutes the documentary reverts to real history and exposed an uncomfortable truth behind modern America. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe acting of the numerous bogus historians throughout the documentary is convincing as each looks reminiscent of the academics you usually see in such documentaries. This combined with real historic stock footage and minor voice over work makes for a fun experiment, although the acting of Larry Peterson as presidential hopeful John Ambrose Fauntroy V, and as his predecessors, is sometimes overly expressive and irritating (much like a real politician then).\r\n</p><p>\r\nOverall this is a very entertaining experiment in speculative history and looks like it has been researched very well adding to the unsettling plausibility of its political observations. How close to this reality the world came is uncertain; close enough to be worrying.\r\n</p><p>\r\nUnfortunately my knowledge of American history is a little thin and therefore I imagine I may have missed some of the more impressive or subtle comments hidden within the film. In itself this is a good documentary and will be enjoyed by historians and intellectuals but may be lost on the wider audience who may not understand the real history and therefore find it difficult to draw out the comparisons with this bogus reality.\r\n</p><p>\r\nRecommended for fans of <i>Time Team</i>, <i>Fahrenheit 9/11</i> and similar time tweak experiments such as <i>'The Man in the High Castle'</i> by Philip K. Dick (Minority Report) or <i>'Fatherland'</i> by Robert Harris (Enigma).</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	354	2011-03-26
355	1	27	\N	Little Miss Sunshine	<p>\r\nThe Sun is dying, the light and heat it emits is fading away, condemning Earth and its entire population to a frozen death. One last chance remains, the space ship Icarus II and its crew of eight scientists and astronauts are heading straight to the very edge of the Sun's corona to deliver a massive stellar bomb that could create a new star from the embers of the old. \r\n</p><p>\r\nBeyond the reach of Earth's communications the crew pick up a new signal, the distress beacon of the Icarus I, the first attempt to reignite the Sun, lost without a trace seven years earlier. Thoughtful physicist Capa (Cillian Murphy - Batman Begins) decides to alter the ship's course to rendezvous with Icarus I and salvage its bomb, but the mission goes disastrously wrong forcing the ship's survivors to weigh the lives of their comrades with Earth's very survival. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSunshine's central premise seems to be cobbled together from films such as The Core and Event Horizon, hardly pictures that seem worthy of imitation. However, director Danny Boyle and his long time collaborator, writer Alex Garland, have history in reinvigorating tired formulas. In 2002 the pair conspired to produce the heart pounding zombie horror <i>28 Days Later</i>, which remains one of the all time highlights of what was previously a shambling genre of clichs. They perform a similar trick again. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIn <i>Sunshine</i> the familiar parade of lesser known actors meeting their demise in a variety of space accidents en route to saving the world somehow never makes one think of Armageddon. Why? The film has pretensions of serious science fiction with hints of philosophy, psychology and theology thrown in. Somehow Boyle and his fellow filmmakers largely manage to juggle these elements without detracting from the film's central blockbuster plot. That the film never looks or feels like a big budget Hollywood popcorn flick isn't to say that the production design and special effects aren't top quality.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe star of the show is undoubtedly the Sun itself, which is breathtakingly realised, beautiful and yet quite lethal. It is easy to see why so many of the crew become transfixed by it. Among the human performances Michelle Yeoh (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) is sadly wasted as the ship's botanist but Chris Evans (Cellular) is riveting as the realist who never loses sight of the mission, a man willing to make the tough decisions to ensure its success. Given the right role Evans has the potential to become a massive star in Hollywood. \r\n</p><p>\r\nPerhaps the film that Sunshine owes its greatest debt too is Ridley Scott's <i>Alien</i>, which is echoed in everything from the music, the claustrophobic cinematography through to the crew interaction. Eventually even the narrative resembles Alien's cat and mouse finale when the Capa discovers the Icarus has a guest onboard. Unfortunately it is in this last twenty minutes, when the deaths come in quick succession and the mission reaches its critical phase, that the artistic flourishes start to detract from the plot. In particular the blinding distortions accompanying one sun-drenched figure whenever he appears on screen makes the action difficult to follow. \r\n</p><p>\r\nNevertheless Sunshine proves to be much more than the sum of its parts making it the most satisfying grownup sci-fi film in a very long time.\r\n</p><p>	9	2011-03-26	355	2011-03-26

The judge sentences him to serve 200 hours of community service at the scene of the crime, a performing arts school full of "rich kids".\r\n</p><p>\r\nTyler reports to the school's principal Director Gordon (Rachel Griffiths - Six Feet Under [TV]) who assigns him janitor duties. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDuring his stint at the school, Tyler observes from the sidelines the sheer amount of dancing and musical talent among the pupils. He especially takes a fancy to pretty dancer Nora (Jenna Dewan - Take the Lead) who is busy practicising a routine for her showcase piece.\r\n</p><p>\r\nNora's dream is to be a successful dancer and she hopes her showcase will catch the eye of a prestigious dance company. Nora is determined to work hard on her piece and to produce the best showcase possible. Her dance partner is a fellow pupil and, with the support of her boyfriend Brett (Josh Henderson - Yours, Mine and Ours), she is prepared to put in all the necessary training hours to make it a success. Not only does Nora need to get the routine right but she also needs to choose the right backing track and her friend Miles (played by singer Mario) is on hand to deliver the best tune.\r\n</p><p>\r\nJust when everything seems to be running smoothly, Nora's dance partner is forced to pull out of training due to injury. Nora is left in a desperate situation and needs to find a replacement fast. Cue Tyler, an experienced hip-hop dancer, who steps up to take on the challenge. Nora is apprehensive at first but she has seen his moves and decides the risk is worth it.\r\n</p><p>\r\nTyler and Nora spend more and more time together and really start to hit it off. Meanwhile, Mac is putting pressure on Tyler to spend time with him on the basketball court.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter a falling out with Nora over his timekeeping, Tyler decides to give up on the dancing and return to his hoodlum ways. Nora continues dancing solo and Tyler wins back his friend's trust.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIt takes a horrific tragedy to make Tyler realise what is really important in life and he learns that he cannot give up all the time. Tyler has to fight to win back Nora's trust and the pair finally start dancing again and come up with a kick-arse routine.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWill Tyler and Nora make it to the final showcase performance without any other hiccups?\r\n</p><p>\r\nTatum is simply scrumptious and hot as the funky groover while Dewan is on top form again as the dancing queen following her last impressive role as Sasha in <i>Take the Lead</i>. \r\n</p><p>\r\n<b>Step Up</b> is an entertaining movie with impressive dance routines and great chemistry between the leads. Don't expect an original plot, it has been seen soo many times before, but enjoy the rhythms and sexy grooves.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFans of <i>Save the Last Dance</i>, <i>Honey</i> and <i>Take the Lead</i> are sure to love this movie.

Some have even described it rather accurately as a live action version of the Grand Theft Auto series of computer games. </p>\r\n<p>Leading man Stratham does everything that is asked of his character and never looks even slightly embarrassed, even when running through the streets of Los Angeles sporting a very obvious erection.</p> \r\n<p>Despite the noise and the violence, the film does however have its lyrical moments. Chev performing acrobatics in the sunshine whilst operating a speeding motorbike is just one of a number of episodes that show the storyline in a more redeeming light than just a series of escalating stunts substituting for a plot.</p> <p><i>Crank</i> will no doubt divide audience opinion into those who think it is a tongue in cheek action flick and those who will consider it to be cheap and vulgar. I was just as tempted to give the film a four star rating as I was a two. It certainly doesn't deserve three stars. Nothing about it is middle of the road. However while largely successful in judging that the audience will laugh along at most of its bad taste escapades, the film does eventually leave a sour taste in the mouth.</p> \r\n<p>The depiction of Chelios' gay sidekick is almost homophobic in execution and what Amy Smart (The Butterfly Effect) saw in a part that sees her character practically raped in public in the name of comedy is beyond me?</p> \r\n<p><i>Crank</i> is actually one of the most entertaining action films of the year but it probably deserves to come with a health warning. It's certainly never dull, provided you can stomach its juvenile antics.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	357	2011-03-26
358	1	16	\N	Talladega Nights, The Ballad of Ricky Bobby	\r\n<p>Will Ferrell (The Producers) returns to the screen (again) in a new comedy about the world of NASCAR.\r\n</p><P>\r\nWhen a young dim-witted pit team engineer takes to the wheel of a losing NASCAR and somehow wins the race, he is propelled to stardom and is soon hailed as the all American hero.\r\n</p><P>\r\nAfter a decade at the top with a loving wife and two renegade children, Ricky Bobby is sitting pretty when his world is unexpectedly shaken. The high octane, high testosterone world of NASCAR has a new arrival, a homosexual French formula one driver who hopes to challenge the undefeated Ricky Bobby. \r\n</p><P>\r\nIn a gruelling race Ricky Bobby is defeated by the Frenchman and suffers a terrible crash leaving him physically unharmed but psychologically broken. As a kid Ricky Bobby was told by his drunken vagrant father 'If you aint first, your last' and Ricky Bobby focused his whole life on that example. Can Ricky Bobby overcome his fears and return to glory?\r\n </p><P>\r\nWhen I went to watch 'Talledega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby' I was in hysterics. It has been quite a while since I laughed embarrassingly at a Will Ferrell comedy but this movie was really entertaining. Maybe because I wasn't expecting it to be so funny or maybe because it was so stupid, either way it was great.\r\n</p><P>\r\n<i> "Well, I'm the best there is. Plain and simple, when I wake up in the morning, I piss excellence."</i><b>Ricky Bobby</b>\r\n</p><P>\r\nAlongside Will Ferrell we meet many strange and funny characters including his lifelong friend Cal (John C. Reilly - Dark Water), his buxom blonde wife Carley (Leslie Bibb - NipTuck [TV]) and his alcoholic sex mad father Reese (Gary Cole - Dodgeball). Also along the way we meet Ricky Bobby's caring mother (Jane Lynch - The 40 Year Old Virgin) and in a surprising development, man mountain Michael Clarke Duncan (Sin City) as the pit team captain with a secret karaoke fantasy.\r\n</p><P>\r\nThis film isn't overly original but it is funny and if you liked 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy' you'll be in convulsions. I would recommend this film for fans of Anchorman and Dodgeball.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	358	2011-03-26
344	1	15	Blah	Snakes on a Plane	<p>Each year major Hollywood studios manage to turn what on paper seem like intriguing ideas into big screen disappointments, so this summer one such studio has tried to tackle the process in reverse by transforming an abysmal idea into a nugget of cinematic gold.</p>\r\n<p>Successful alchemy, however, is just as rare today as it was in the middle ages and those expecting Snakes on a Plane to be the must see film of 2006 seem to have become deluded by their own hype.</p>\r\n<p>Internet enthusiasts may have demanded that certain scenes be added for cheap thrills and lines of dialogue to echo earlier, better, Samuel L. Jackson performances, but take these away and the script is still poor, the action largely predictable and the acting of varying quality to say the least.</p>\r\n<p>What may be the lasting legacy of this frankly forgettable film is how Hollywood chooses to market its movies in the future. After all when New Line Cinema announced the ludicrous plot of this B-Movie thriller I doubt any executive could have imagined just how popular it would become thanks to its self-explanatory title.</p>\r\n<p>Although the fan produced merchandise, trailers and songs were entertaining I imagine studio executives further relished the film's crossover into mainstream media where dozens of column inches where filled without charge by journalists keen to latch onto the next big thing. All that free advertising has undoubtedly inflated the film's box office takings, although not to the extent that many had predicted.</p>\r\n<p>The fan contributions to the filmmaking process, which resulted in a week's extra filming of tits and gore, has undoubtedly livened up what would have been an extremely tedious lowbrow experience, but taking the current reliance on audience reactions during test screenings to the next stage hardly feels like a positive step forward.</p>\r\n<p>In the future the opinion of the film going public will be more closely sought before a film even goes in front of the cameras and no doubt more changes will be made according to their wishes.</p>\r\n<p>Snakes on a Plane itself, however, should be ample warning enough that giving the people what they want is not necessarily a good thing.</p>\r\n<p>So back to the film. How much excitement can actually be generated by having hundreds of venomous snakes go crazy on helpless stereotypes at 30,000 feet? The initial mayhem in the passenger cabins as the reptiles strike on mass and nibble on what seems like almost all of the film's unfortunate extras are actually a heck of a lot of fun, but afterwards the filmmakers run fresh out of ideas.</p>\r\n<p>The previous sequence had shown victims being bitten in every conceivable place and beyond that the premise simply has very little left to offer.</p>\r\n<p>In the end the age old "Does anyone know how to fly a plane?" conundrum is dusted down in desperation to give the film some sort of finale. Nathan Phillips (Wolf Creek) is completely forgettable as the reluctant witness being transported to Los Angeles by the FBI but most of the supporting cast, particularly Julianna Margulies (ER [TV]) as a harassed stewardess, never give anything less than their utmost. In fact the supporting characters are surprisingly well sketched considering the genre they find themselves in, although I for one was disappointed that so many of them were still alive and kicking come touch down.</p>\r\n<p>The difference between cult classic and complete crap is a very fine line indeed and Snakes on a Plane just about skates on the right side of the edge. If you are able to let go of your scepticism you should find enough gruesome humour to keep you comfortable in your cinema seat but if you are searching for the next big thing you will be sorely disappointed.</p>\r\n<p>Fans of <I>Slither</I> and <I>Eight-Legged Freaks</I> are sure to enjoy this movie.</p>	3	2011-03-26	344	2012-03-08

628	1	20	\N	Burn After Reading	<p>\r\nDid you ever see <i> 'The Big Lebowski'</i>? Many movie fans love that film and since its 1998 release it has amassed a cult following. Sadly like many cults most people missed it or misunderstood it. If you didn't see it, or if you did and you liked it, please go see <B><i>Burn After Reading</i></b> and let me know what you think.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOsbourne (John Malkovich - The Mutant Chronicles) is a disgruntled ex-CIA analyst who decides to write up his memoirs while drinking retirement away. His frosty wife, Katie (Tilda Swinton - Michael Clayton), tired of her husband's boozing and moaning, starts legal proceedings to get a divorce and also has an affair with a smooth talking treasury officer, Harry (George Clooney - Michael Clayton). Harry likes to cruise dating websites finding easy sex with desperate middle aged women while making imaginative sex aid furniture in his basement. Meanwhile across town a lonely but vain gym instructor, Linda (Frances McDormand - Friends with Money), is finding it hard to fund her cosmetic surgery until her colleague, Chad (Brad Pitt - Oceans 13), a dizzy personal trainer, finds them a ray of hope.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAll of these disparate characters are drawn together when Chad finds a CD in the ladies locker room. The CD contains the early drafts for Osbourne's memoirs and together Chad and Linda quickly hatch a plan to blackmail Osbourne. Sadly Osbourne is undaunted by his would-be blackmailers and after a career dealing with idiots decides to turn on them and forces their hand. Meanwhile things aren't going too well for Harry and Katie. Harry is becoming increasingly paranoid as he keeps catching glimpses of cars following him as he jogs, and parking near his house. Katie, eager for a divorce, is beginning to question the commitment of her lover who is growing ever more distant.\r\n</p><p>\r\nEach character is exaggerated and well cast with great actors. The story isn't too deep but is full of dark situational comedy. Here is the issue; the comedy caters for a very specific taste. That is why I began this review asking you loyal readers if you ever watched <i> 'The Big Lebowski'</i>. The same dark and slightly eccentric comedy fills the movie and if it doesn't appeal to your tastes this could be a dull movie.\r\n</p><p>\r\nI would recommend this for fans of <i>'O Brother Where Art Thou'</i> and <i> 'The Big Lebowski'</i>.\r\n</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	628	2011-03-26

380	1	15	\N	Starter for Ten	<p>\r\nWide-eyed teenager Brian arrives at Bristol University bursting with enthusiasm. Coming from a sheltered background he is eager to sample new experiences and, above all else, soak up as much learning as possible. \r\n</p><p>\r\nHis impressive breadth of general knowledge ensures that he is selected for the University Challenge team where he falls for the dazzling Alice (Alice Eve - Big Nothing), although he also finds he has something of a spark with socially conscious Rebecca (Rebecca Hall - The Prestige), both of whom may just be out of Brian's league.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBrian's awkward social skills present more than a few bumps in his attempts to woo both girls and he also neglects his childhood friend Spencer, who has avoided university in favour of petty fraud and unemployment. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWith his friendships fraying and his higher education on a slippery slope, can Brian get his brain in gear to win the University Challenge quiz? \r\n</p><p>\r\nHaving enjoyed Starter for Ten the book so much I couldn't help but be a little disappointed with this cinematic adaptation. The ending has been changed and Brian's relationship with both Alice and his best friend Spencer has been dramatically modified.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe end result is that Starter for Ten the film is a much more predictable experience than reading its counterpart novel. While the book couldn't exactly be described as edgy, the film is practically a paint by numbers romantic comedy. The blame for this surely lies with author David Nicolls who has written the film's screenplay based on his own book. He chooses to play it safe with his characters, but it does the film no good in the long run since it diminishes so much of what made the story special in the first place. \r\n</p><p>\r\nGone is the militant Rebecca who, in the novel, is so acerbic that she doesn't easily earn the readers' affections, replaced instead by a perfectly pleasant young lady who is now obviously more of a catch than Alice. \r\n</p><p>\r\nStill the film does have several aces up its sleeve. Nicolls has some great comic set pieces that are used to good effect, not least the excruciating New Year's holiday spent with Alice's parent that Brian manages to superbly torpedo by confronting her mother while high on weed. \r\n</p><p>\r\nMark Gatiss (The League of Gentleman) deserves special praise for his utterly eccentric impression of University Challenge host Bamber Gascoigne and the entire finale is a hoot. Above all else, however, it is the charming presence of James McAvoy that saves the film from banality. After impressing as Mr Tumnus in The Chronicles of Narnia, McAvoy makes Brian the kind of loser that you can actually root for. It's the sort of performance that Tobey Maguire repeatedly fails to pull off as Peter Parker in the Spiderman films. \r\n</p><p>\r\nStarter for Ten is a pleasantly amusing coming of age comedy. It has some likeable performances and conjures up a steady stream of laughs but, although I am perhaps judging it more harshly because I have read the original novel, I can't help but feel this film had the potential to be so much more.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	380	2011-03-26
3	1	15	\N	Blade Trinity	<p>Motorbike riding muscle man Wesley Snipes (Liberty Stands Still) returns one last time as half vampire Blade to try and quietly rid the world of undead coffin dodgers. Unfortunately, even in a film series that can hardly be described as complicated, Blade Trinity suffers from a plot so underdeveloped that it doesn't even come close to reaching the shallow heights of its two predecessors. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>The vampire nation seems to be having a crisis of confidence after repeated bitch slappings at the hands of Blade. Looking for reinforcements, head blood sucker Danica (Parker Posey - Scream 3) jets off to Syria to dig up the first vampire, an armour wearing chump with serious dental hygiene issues who now goes by the name of Drake (Dracula is sooo 1890's!). </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Meanwhile back in Gotham, Blade is 'tricked' into shooting a human in the chest with a six inch metal stake while being filmed. Caught on camera and now being chased by the law, Blade has to rely on a gang of young hotshot vampire slayers, who go by the name of the Nightstalkers, to help him. Except the Nightstalkers don't really help Blade, the evil vampires don't have some grand scheme up their sleeves other than 'lets kill Blade,' and Drake (Dominic Purcell - Equilibrium) is about as menacing as a bodybuilder with brain damage can get. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Kris Kristofferson (Blade II) is back as Blade's mentor Whistler, but since he gets bumped off in the first fifteen minutes, which the entire cast fail to acknowledge, one has to wonder what was the point of killing him off in the original film only to go to great lengths in the sequel to resurrect him so they could toast him immediately at the start of number three? </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Wesley Snipes hardly speaks throughout the whole movie which makes him a thoroughly dull superhero who simply wanders around like a killing machine dispatching anything on two legs that wanders within stabbing range. Part of the problem is that most of his dialogue seems to have been transferred to head Nightstalker Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds - Van Wilder).</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Reynolds proves to be the saving grace of the film, generating plenty of laughs and managing to distract the audience from the strangely listless action and bloodletting that were the hallmarks of the previous two episodes. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Of the rag tag group of extras who make up the Nightstalker support team, it immediately becomes clear that those who don't have any sort of superpowers, not to mention dialogue, would shortly find themselves on the wrong end of a pair of pointy incisors. Partnering Reynolds (special ability - wisecracking) is Jessica Biel (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) as Abigail Whistler (special ability - looking fabulous in tight trousers and crop tops) but since she is even less chatty than Blade she has to be content making an impression by doing gymnastics and pouting. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Despite not being a patch on either of its predecessors, Blade Trinity does have enough fights and explosions and "arrow shafts through the eye" moments to keep the less demanding audience member happy. Perhaps if the script and plot had received a little more polishing then this potentially last entry in the series would have gone out with a bite instead of a proverbial gumming.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	3	2011-03-26
4	1	16	\N	Catwoman	<p>Following a long historical line of mysterious catwomen dating back to Egyptian times, it's now Halle Berry's turn to don the catsuit as Catwoman, breaking away from the Batman franchise in this stand alone movie. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patience Philips (Halle Berry - Gothika) is a timid graphic designer with no dress sense and no real presence about her. She works for a large cosmetics company headed by George Hedare (Lambert Wilson - The Matrix Revolutions) and his age conscious wife Laurel (Sharon Stone - Cold Creek Manor) who are preparing to launch a revolutionary anti-aging cream. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>During her non-existence, one day Patience climbes out of her apartment window to save a tabby cat and is herself saved by a gorgeous cop, Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt - Miss Congeniality). With a new man in her life things are looking up for Patience, however while working late one day she uncovers a dark secret hidden within the cosmetics empire and evil agents soon silence her. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unbeknown to Patience, she is rescued from death by the mysterious tabby cat she tried to save earlier that day. She is reincarnated as a completely new person with new abilities and a new persona, more self confident and stylish. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the day she is confused Patience while at night she assumes her true feline capabilities as her alter ego Catwoman. Gifted with a heightened sense of sight, feline agility and super strength Catwoman can do whatever she puts her mind to but when a series of robberies and murderers points the blame at her new identity. Will she be able to clear her name? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Michelle Pfeiffer's portrayal of Catwoman in Batman Returns was dark, mysterious and raunchy, Halle Berry provides a tamer more sultry cat exploring more the duality of her personality. Whereas Pfeiffer's Catwoman engaged in a lot more real fight scenes Berry's Catwoman makes the most of CGI to mimic her extraordinary feline capabilities and as such gets to climb more walls and leap more alleyways. Its up to you the audience to decide which you feel is better, each has its merits and charms. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Halle Berry was cast purrfectly for the role and I can not think of anyone else who could have pulled off wearing the sexy cat suit and strut so confidently while also remaining cute and vulnerable. Benjamin Bratt provides the love interest although his confident cop character isn't really given much time to engage the crowd. Luckily Sharon Stone's blonde possibly bad possibly good former model is suitably sexy with the blond hair and white suits to balance out against Catwoman's black leather. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Catwoman has received a hard time from the US critics which is unjustified. This film is very entertaining with plenty of fight sequences and special effects to capture the audience and a story, though well trodden, that keeps good pace. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watch this is you like comic book adaptations such as Daredevil and especially if you're a fan of Halle Berry wearing small revealing outfits.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	4	2011-03-26
5	1	16	\N	Connie and Carla	<p>Connie (Nia Vardalos - My Big Fat Greek Wedding) and Carla (Toni Collette - Muriel's Wedding) are a couple of singing starlets looking for their big break into musical theatre. They spend their days working as singing waitresses in an airport bar waiting to be discovered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After witnessing the murder of their bar manager by some ruthless drug barons, our two heroines are forced to flee all they know and hide in LA, far from the killers hot on their heels.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>As the girls ponder how to revive their struggling finances destiny guides them to a local gay bar where drag acts mime show tunes and disco classics to the party crowd. It doesn't take too long for the girls to enter auditions to perform in the show, but with good voices and too convincing female looks the girls are sure fire winners. Girls on the run hiding in disguise as gay guys dressed as girls is surely a great plan sufficient to fool any hood. Unfortunately the ladies are confronted by unexpected fame and confused true love. Can their friendship survive the stress and can the girls survive the chase?</p>\r\n \r\n<p>In a story centred on friendship the two leading ladies have great chemistry. Nia Vardalos follows up 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' with another fine comedic performance, and Toni Collette returns to the comedy genre with zest. Meanwhile in support you'll find that Stephen Spinella (Great Expectations, Ravenous) and David Duchovny (Evolution, X - Files) add a great side story of a transsexual and his straight laced brother, respectively, seeking to reconcile the past and find a closer bond after years apart. Two roles that add a deeper meaning to the girls' comedy that helps strengthen the story and also provide an original and thought provoking love interest for one of the leading ladies.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>This film may not have the refreshing script of 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' but it does provide plenty of laughs even if the story may at times seem formulaic. If you liked watching 'Priscilla Queen of the Desert' or the 'Sister Act' movies, you'll love this film.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	5	2011-03-26
6	1	20	\N	Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban	<p><img src="graphics/kids.gif" align="right">After an eighteen month break allowing some of the LOTR furore to calm down, fans of fantasy may need a fix. So what better time to release the latest in the Harry Potter series of movies? With a new director, arguably the best of the books thus far written and even more British acting talent, this new Harry Potter movie sounds like box office dynamite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those living under a rock for the last decade, J K Rowling's Harry Potter stories follow the adventures of a young orphaned boy who finds out on his eleventh birthday that he is descended from wizards. He is quickly released from the boring domain of everyday people and whisked off to a world of magic and excitement where he studies spells at the mysterious school of witchcraft and wizardry, Hogwarts. Each year at his new school Harry has another adventure and each time he unravels more of the history of his family and of the fateful night when they were murdered and he alone survived the wrath of "he who must not be named".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is intended that there will be seven books, one for each year of Harry's attendance at Hogwarts. Currently Rowling is working on the sixth book while the movies of the first two books have each been huge box office successes. Each boasted a wealth of near all British acting talent and were directed by Chris Columbus (Home Alone) who brought the magic to life, so to speak, using wherever possible real locations around the country to double for Hogwarts. After two great successes, Mr Columbus has passed the reins over to Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron (Great Expectations).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Prisoner of Azkaban joins Harry in his third year at Hogwarts, now thirteen, and starting to feel the agitation and unfairness of teenage life. Harry is changing, and as Harry grows more mature so does the story. We start the film with Harry finally confronting his semi abusive aunt and uncle and then running away from home only to be nearly attacked by a mysterious wolf. Harry is fortunately rescued by a triple decker purple bus, a movie gem, and whisked to safety in the magical world where we learn that the most infamous murderous wizard of all time, Sirius Black, has escaped from near inescapable prison of Azkaban. Sirius Black has a dark connection with young Mr Potter and it would seem that Harry is the next target of this most feared criminal. Why does Sirius seek Harry and why, strangely, do so many fear that Harry may seek him? These are the mysteries that start the adventure and it is definitely an adventure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In comparison to the first two films new director Cuaron has kept the pace of this third film moving along and has dispensed with many of the blind alleys and packing that stretched its predecessors. The story is more focused and the script is a little sharper allowing for a more edgy movie. Meanwhile Cuaron has managed to retain the strong visual styles and set designs that make these films, although fantastical, so very real and textured. The incredible effects are superior to the previous two films and yet are treated quite fairly, not allowing them to detract from the core of the story, merely to add to its reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turning now to the stars of the movie, I am happy to report that the acting of the three principle characters, namely Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson), have continued to improve from their earlier movies, especially Emma Watson who practically steals the show. In support we are treated to Harry Potter veterans Maggie Smith (Tea with Mussolini) as stiff yet caring Professor McGonagall and Alan Rickman (Die Hard) as sinister Professor Snape who I'm delighted to see with a larger role and more of that acid tongue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New additions to the cast include Micheal Gambon (Sleepy Hollow) as headmaster professor Albus Dumbledore who does well taking over from the late great Richard Harris and Emma Thompson (Pride & Prejudice) who makes a memorable appearance as the dappy whimsical divination teacher Professor Trelawney. Finally we must pay special attention to both David Thewlis (The Big Lebowski) as Professor Lupin and Gary Oldman (Leon) as Sirius Black who each gave this film an extra quality of acting. Although Oldman does not properly appear until near the end of the show his performance is grand and Thewlis as Professor Lupin, mentor to Harry, is so good on screen you can understand why some children cry to see his character do a Mary Poppin's in the final scenes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall this is a new Harry Potter movie. It has the familiar style and imagery of its predecessors allowing for a flow of consistency but it is darker and grittier. The vile dementors that appear in the film are truly quite scary and the painful knowledge of the truth but inability to prove it adds a very real slant on the film. The story is not necessarily happy and it leaves some questions unanswered allowing kids to argue in the playground and seemingly disinterested adults to bicker at dinner parties. The new eye behind the lens has given this film a new sense of character and the franchise a needed breath of fresh air. I would recommend this film to children in the early teens, their parents and all fans of the books but feel that some of the scarier scenes may be too much for small children. Roll on book six, and get ready for the goblet of fire expected some time in 2005.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	6	2011-03-26
8	1	20	\N	I, Robot	<p>In the not too distant future it is more than plausible that mankind will use robots to help perform menial tasks, in fact, it is inevitable. Already many industrial manufacturers use a variety of automated robots to build their products. The machines are faster, stronger and, if maintained, are more reliable than a human workforce. Set in the not too distant future I,Robot is based loosely on the various robot stories written by the late Isaac Asimov.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his works, Asimov created and explored the now famous three laws of robotics. The laws are very simple and are designed to govern the behaviour of robots.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.<br>\r\n2. A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.<br>\r\n3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.<br>\r\n\r\n<p>These laws have actually been used in modern robotics and the development of artificial intelligence. With such a fact based grounding for some great science fiction movie potential, why do the movies themselves fall short of potential?</p> \r\n\r\n<p>In I, Robot, Will Smith (Bad Boys 2) plays Del Spooner, a hard as nails detective investigating the mysterious death of a famous robot engineer and inventor. Del has a troubled past and remains unconvinced of the apparent perfect subservient behaviour of the robots. So when a robot, Sonny, is found hiding at the scene of the accident Del's suspicions increase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Del investigates the circumstances surrounding the good doctor's death, he finds more questions than answers and after a threat to his life, his paranoia is replaced by genuine concern. Assisted by the chilly Dr Calvin (Bridget Moynahan - The Recruit), Del must unravel the mystery of the ghost in the machine and follow a set of cryptic clues before events spiral out of control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I, Robot is a tense science fiction thriller with some great effects and some truly impressive action sequences. Similar to Stephen Spielberg's Minority Report, the future is presented quite similar to the present, except for better technology. Cars drive on autopilot along ten lane highways and buildings are so tall they seem to tap at the upper atmosphere. Despite these advances the world still has lots of litter and there crime will always be crime on the streets. Unfortunately, while Minority Report successfully blended thought provoking science fiction with good action to make a five star film, this movie falls short.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Director Alex Proyas (Dark City) has made a visually impressive movie and he keeps events moving along at a good pace. Alas, unlike some of his earlier movies, this film seems to skip over some of the more engaging ideas in favour of more action. As an example, the story taps briefly on the blurred line between humanity and artificial intelligence when the robot Sonny is forced to confront the possibility of his own death. The idea that the robots may have their own personality and their own intent is central to the movies story, yet despite the potential for some good thought provoking cinema, this movie skips to the next chase scene.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>What's going on Alex? With Dark City you showed your ability to keep an intelligent story moving alongside the action. Did Hollywood tie your hands?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sadly the acting in the movie is also a little off key. Bridget Moynahan's character is also a little under developed so despite her best efforts she does not truly connect with the audience. In the lead role, Will Smith follows 2003's Bad Boys 2 with another role as a shoot from the hip detective with a loud attitude. The character of Del Spooner with his dark scarred history provides some acting challenges but sadly Will seems to strut more like a broody teenager rather than a troubled sleuth and is almost out acted by the computer generated robot, Sonny. Not a career best.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>I,Robot is a very fun movie filled with good special effects and some imaginative action sequences. Sonny is a particular highlight as his cool steady voice combined with excellent CGI makes for one of the more plausible robots in cinema history. Meanwhile female fans of Will Smith will be happy to note that you get to see the star wearing only his boxers or less in a number of scenes. Male nudity aside, this is a good popcorn movie that will entertain a wide audience but sadly it falls short of its considerable potential.</p> \r\n	2	2011-03-26	8	2011-03-26
7	1	12	Another surprisingly unshit comic adaptation	Hellboy	<p>In the 1940s, the Nazis make a last-ditch attempt to change the course of WW2 by releasing the Seven Gods of Chaos from their ancient crystal prison. The ritual is thwarted but not before something slips through the opened portal, a red baby demon that is nicknamed Hellboy. Sixty years later, Hellboy is a six and a half foot tall, virtually indestructible giant who works as an agent in the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense. When an old enemy returns to bring about the Apocalypse, Hellboy and his fellow agents in the BPRD must defeat the demons of the past, and the demons within.\r\n\r\n<p>Another month, another comic book adaptation, but this is one that is a little out of the ordinary. The original <i>Hellboy</i> comic was the brainchild of one Mike Mignola, a distinctive artist who mixed Nazi occultism, the mythos of HP Lovecraft, and folk myths and legends into his stories of the paranormal investigator with the giant stone right hand. The big-screen version comes courtesy of long-time fan Guillermo Del Toro (Blade II), and is a dream come true for him; Del Toro has wanted to direct a <i>Hellboy</i> film for years, and passed on both <i>Blade: Trinity</i> and <i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</i> in order to do so. \r\n\r\n<p>Recent superhero films from the likes of Bryan Singer (X-Men 2) and Sam Raimi (Spider-Man 2) have reminded audiences that a superhero film doesn't have to be of the completely brainless action variety, like the Joel Schumacher <i>Batman</i> films. <i>Hellboy</i> exists somewhere between the two, bereft of a big enough budget to effect any eye-popping action sequences, and lacking sufficiently developed characters to carry the film as a drama. The budgetary handicap was self-imposed by Del Toro, who had always wanted to cast Ron Perlman(Blade II) rather than an unknown and so made the necessary sacrifice. Mike Mignola had also advocated Perlman from the very start, and they made the right choice. <i>Hellboy</i> hinges on its central performance, and Perlman brings the character to life with a cocky attitude and irascible wit.\r\n\r\n<p>As is par for the course, character development elsewhere is rather patchy and only Hellboy and the pyrokinetic Liz Sherman (Selma Blair - A Guy Thing) are well-rounded enough to deserve any sympathy from the audience. The new boy, John Myers, is used as an effective means of introducing the various members of the BRPD, but Myers is a fairly limp character and does very little for the rest of the film other than to form part of an unconvincing love triangle between himself, Liz and Hellboy. Other notable contributions are those of David Hyde Pierce (Frasier [TV]), who provides an excellent voice for (the mainly CG) Abe Sapien, and the perenially excellent John Hurt (Dogville), who lends some gravitas to the affair as the head of the BRPD and Hellboy's adoptive father, Professor Brumenholm. Sadly neither of them get as much screen-time as they deserved, and the film suffers as a result. On the side of evil, only the mute Nazi assassin Kroenen is worth mentioning, as both of his companions are as devoid of menace as the Seven Squids of Chaos.\r\n\r\n<p>So, on the Right Hand of Doom <i>Hellboy</i> has sharp dialogue, wry humour and an eclectic group of personalities. On the merely human left hand, it has a series of repetitive set-pieces, thin characters, a plot with a number of gaping holes, and an anti-climatic end. It's probably just me, but the finale could have done with Hellboy taking on an army of Nazi zombies rather than another CG monster. Saying that, it beats its <i>Resident Evil</i> equivalent tentacles, ahem, hands down.\r\n\r\n<p>Though it doesn't reach the heights of, say, <i>Spiderman 2</i>, <i>Hellboy</i> is a decent enough effort that entertains in a fairly mindless way. <i>Hellboy 2</i> is already in pre-production, with Del Toro at the helm again, and with previously established characters and a bigger budget, <i>Hellboy 2</i> the sequel has the potential to be the awesome film that <i>Hellboy</i> could have been.  \r\n	3	2011-03-26	9	2012-03-13
10	1	20	\N	King Arthur	<p>How good is your knowledge of early British history, the withdrawal of the Romans and the attack of the Anglo Saxon's? Not that clear? Neither is mine. Cashing in on this the makers of the King Arthur movie have come up with an original reworking of the Arthur legend. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have seen any of the numerous King Arthur films you'll probably be aware of the legend of the sword in the stone, the magician Merlin, the round table, the tryst between Sir Lancelot and Guinevere and the magical lady of the lake. Some of these make an appearance in the new King Arthur movie but on the whole this is a brand new take on the story. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clive Owen (Croupier) is Artorius (Arthur), a Roman captain defending the north of England from the native pagan tribes led by fearsome yet wise Merlin. His knights are mercenaries from Eastern Europe who are reaching the end of their conscription and are eager to get home. However before Arthur and his knight are freed from their duties, they must undertake one daring mission. They must travel north of Hadrian's Wall, the last defence against the wild north, and rescue a Roman family before they are besieged by an invading Anglo Saxon army. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Arthur and his knights travel beyond the boundary of safety into the realm of their enemies they will face many challenges. Outnumbered and caught between various enemies we see the faith and humanity of Arthur tested as he slowly realises that his responsibility to Rome does not sit well with his loyalty to his knights and his choice to defend the weak from the tyranny of an oppressor. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clive Owen gives a strong performance as Arthur, both emotive and engaging, a bit of rough for the female audience to swoon over. Indeed it can be seen why many people tip Mr Owen as a possible next James Bond once Pierce Brosnan packs away his tux. However with so much concentration on the lead role, some of the other interesting and important characters feel a bit sketchy. Kiera Knightley (Love Actually) plays Guinevere, a beautiful and fearless warrior native to England who slowly falls in love with Arthur. Her character does not appear for quite some time and at best feels a little incomplete despite a good performance from the young starlet. Similarly Ioan Gruffudd (Hornblower [tv]) as broody warrior Lancelot, Ray Winstone (Sexy Beast) as comedic and ill mannered thug Bors and Hugh Dancy (Black Hawk Down) as noble and loyal Galahad are not really given enough plot to form a connection with the audience. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story is a clear departure from earlier King Arthur movies and it taps upon some good ideas such as the conflict between emerging Christianity and ancestral paganism and the idea of having Merlin as a pagan leader fighting a resistance against the suppressing Roman regime. Unfortunately these good ideas are left hanging while the film concentrates instead upon a mass attack from the invading Anglo-Saxon's. A formless mass of wild men led by Stellan Skarsgrd who has no real motivation or purpose other than to burn and growl at either his enemy or his curiously groomed son Til Schweiger (Lara Croft Tomb Raider - Cradle of Life).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To its merit King Arthur has some impressive fight sequences and a good amount of action that makes for a fairly good popcorn movie. However when compared to similar veined hero stories such as Gladiator or The Last Samurai, this film feels a little contrived rather than authentic. I would like to give King Arthur three stars but alas it did not exceed any expectations and, although entertaining, it did not live up to its potential.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	10	2011-03-26
360	1	27	\N	World Trade Center	<p>Rather than focusing entirely on the horrific events of 9/11, World Trade Center concentrates on the plight and heroism of those who tried to save the injured from the burning twin towers.\r\n</p><p>\r\nStarting out as a normal day, a team of port authority officers set off on their daily beat.  Within a short space of time, the unimaginable happens, a loud tremor shakes the city and the officers are called back to the office to hear the shocking news.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nA commuter plane has hit the north tower and all emergency forces are being called in to help evacuate the building. A team of port authority police volunteer to go in, led by Sergeant John McLoughlin (Nicholas Cage - National Treasure).\r\n</p><p>\r\nArmed with oxygen and protective gear, McLoughlin, Will Jimeno (Michael Pena - Million Dollar Baby), Dominick Pezzulo (Jay Hernandez - Hostel) and their colleagues rush into the north tower to help with the rescue.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAt this point no-one knows that the second tower has also been hit and soon rescuers are being called away to assist at the south tower.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAs the port authority officers make their way up to the casualties, there is an almighty rumble and the tower starts to collapse around them.  Only three of them manage to make it towards the elevator shaft with a slim chance of survival.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMcLoughlin, Jimeno and Pezzulo wake up amid dirt, debris and tonnes of heavy cement.  While McLoughlin and Jimeno are stuck fast, Pezzulo manages to break free and tries to save his comrades but a sudden collapse of heavy debris foils his plan.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMeanwhile at home the McLoughlin and Jimeno families are having to face the awful ordeal of waiting to hear if their loved ones went into the towers and whether they are dead or alive.\r\n</p><p>\r\nDonna McLoughlin (Maria Bello - Thank You For Smoking) is trying to comfort her four children while inside she is fighting with her own demons over her distant relationship with her husband.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nIn the Jimeno household, pregnant wife Allison (Maggie Gyllenhaal - Trust the Man) is frustrated with the wait and unknown and is preparing herself for the worse.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe film follows the strength and bravery of two men close to death who are determined to come out alive together and be reunited with their families again.\r\n</p><p>\r\nDirector Oliver Stone (JFK) is not affraid to tackle big heavy topice and with the potential for massive political statement many may feel it is too early for a film about 9/11. Thankfully this film makes no political comment and does not mention those responsible for the attack, instead it focuses quite rightly on the heroism of the emergency services trying to help those in and under the towers.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWorld Trade Center is a heartfelt, tear-jerker of a movie and it really hits home the terrifying nature of this real-life ordeal for the families of the victims and the rescuers trapped inside.\r\n</p>	9	2011-03-26	360	2011-03-26
367	1	15	\N	Pulse	<p>University student Mattie (Kristen Bell - Veronica Mars [TV]) isn't feeling very chipper. Her boyfriend has recently hung himself and now she is getting cries for help via instant messenger from his disconnected computer. \r\n</p><p>\r\nMattie decides to track down the machine's new owner, Dexter (Ian Somerhalder - Lost [TV]), who claims not to be the culprit but instead shows her footage he has found saved on the PC of other people apparently committing suicide. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAs the images spread first across the campus and then countrywide Mattie's friends start to mirror her boyfriend's behaviour just before his death. With the news reporting an ever-increasing epidemic of suicides, Mattie desperately tries to discover who or what is causing so much death and why? \r\n</p><p>\r\nFilmed in and around grim concrete housing projects in Eastern Europe provides Pulse with a fitting setting for a storyline that has modern isolation and decay at its core. The protagonists spend their time walled up inside grimy bedrooms surrounded by the latest technology while the world outside is grey and devoid of life. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIt is obvious what point the filmmakers are trying to make by creating this bleak existence for their characters but the problem is that none of them are injected with enough vitality to make the audience care about their eventual fates. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe characterisation is so thin it is actually impossible to discern any change in those who have had their lives drained away by the supernatural forces causing the deaths. Those unlucky enough to have paid to watch the film are more in danger of losing the will to live than anyone up on screen. Only leading lady Kristen Bell shows enough sparkle to prove that she is actually an actress with some charisma despite the surroundings she finds herself in. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAdapted from the original Japanese horror <i>Kairo</i>, Pulse manages to dispense with the mind bending visual chicanery that eastern horrors conjure up so readily and replaces these terrifying moments with obvious jumps and computer-generated effects. And then to compound its error Pulse does emulate its Asian inspiration by not making a lick of sense. What initiates the ghost attacks? At the start it appears that they prey upon anyone who has watched the sinister web cam footage, just like the videotape in The Ring, but if that were the case our heroine wouldn't still be struggling to put two and two together at the film's climax, she would be a smear on the floor of her apartment since she is among the first to see the creepy images. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAnother perplexing question that is never satisfyingly explained is exactly who or what the 'ghosts' actually are? Not to mention the fact that during the first hour of the film they make their victims listless and eventually suicidal after touching them but during the second hour those affected simply disintegrate into a murky puddle. \r\n</p><p>\r\nPulse is a film that is dreary in every possible way imaginable. You could have a more rewarding time trapped in a lift.\r\n</p>\r\n	1	2011-03-26	367	2011-03-26
368	1	20	\N	The Black Dahlia	<p>Way back in the 1940's there was a number of great black and white movies following a tireless detective taking on the seedy underworld. These films were characterised by sharp dialogue, the detective's insightful narrative and enough cigarette smoke to keep the tobacco industry alive for another century. One of the best, or most endearing, of these was John Huston's 1941 classic <i>'The Maltese Falcon'</i>.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSince the forties that particular type of noir thriller has to a degree become outdated but thankfully has seen many revivals, most notably with Roman Polanski's <i>'Chinatown'</i> in 1974 and even more recently Curtis Hanson's 1997 movie <i>'L.A. Confidential'</i>. After another nine year break we have another, 'The Black Dahlia'. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWritten by James Ellroy, the author of <i>'L.A. Confidential'</i>, and set in the same golden age of Los Angeles, The Black Dahlia centers on a new and ambitious detective, investigating the gruesome murder of a wannabe starlet. The copper, Dwight (Josh Hartnett - Lucky Number Slevin), has recently been promoted to detective thanks to his new friend and partner Lee (Aaron Eckhart - Thank You For Smoking) and his charming wife Kay (Scarlett Johansson - The Island). Both Lee and Dwight are boxers and they are the poster boy stars of the police department.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter the grizzly discovery of a mutilated actress close to one of their own investigations, the two detectives set to work trying to track down the killer. However Lee's increasingly erratic behavior and some dark secrets from his and Kay's past start to form a divide between the two. Added to this mix Dwight's own investigations have lead him to a mysterious rich temptress Madeleine (Hilary Swank - Million Dollar Baby) who may know more than she is letting on.\r\n</p><p>\r\nPacked with small twists, a healthy amount of passionate sex, and slowly increasing sense of tension, this film fits in nicely with the genre even if it doesn't seem to tread any new ground. It may be the directorial style or the same source author but this film felt a bit too similar to <i>L.A. Confidential</i>. The characters are well presented but are for the most part familiar even if the story is slightly different.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn the lead role as Detective Dwight "Bucky" Bleichert, Josh Hartnett puts in a good performance as the rookie detective, in over his head and in and out of bed. The weakness in his role was that his fine pretty boy looks don't sit well with his character as a successful boxer and detective. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAlongside Josh, Aaron Eckhart is more convincing as the boxer and once again reminds audiences that he is capable of standing centre stage in a big movie. Scarlett Johansson is as ever beautiful and captivating but sadly does not have enough story to really connect and Hilary Swank as the femme fatale delivers some great cutting lines of dialogue but somehow doesn't manage to give the part the sexiness it needed.\r\n</p><p>\r\nDirector Brian De Palma has proven with such classics as <i>'The Untouchables'</i>, <i>'Carlito's Way'</i> and <i>'Scarface'</i> that he can make great crime movies. He has been away for some time following the less successful <i>'Mission to Mars'</i> (2000) and even less widely known <i>'Femme Fatale'</i> (2002) but this film is a good first step towards career recovery.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOverall this was a good entertaining movie and for film fans new to the genre I imagine it will be a great success. For those people who still enjoy repeats of 'Chinatown', 'The Maltese Falcon', 'Bad Day at Black Rock' and 'L.A. Confidential' you'll still find this film gripping and fun, if not as memorable.</p>	3	2011-03-26	368	2011-03-26
369	1	20	\N	Children of Men	<p>Imagine if one day women stopped having babies, what would happen to society? Taking things further, what would happen if after almost twenty years there still haven't been any babies or any clue to why mankind is infertile? Simply put there would be despair, and despair leads to anarchy. \r\n</p><p>\r\n<i>Children of Men</i> is set in a world where there have been no children for 18 years. Society has become fractured and mankind stands on the brink of extinction. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDue to escalating violence the future British government has shifted to the far right and deports all mixed race or foreign nationals, rounding them into cages and camps before shipping them out. Religious sects preach for forgiveness seeing the plague of infertility as god's punishment upon the wicked. Meanwhile terrorist cells fighting the fascist state only add to the instability.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn London lives Theo (Clive Owen - Inside Man), a former political activist who has become numb after a painful past and drifts on in the knowledge of a bleak future. One day this stable if sad existence is turned on its head when his former wife Julian (Julianne Moore - Trust The Man), a radical, abducts him to seek his help. \r\n</p><p>\r\nBy a miracle a young black girl has fallen pregnant. Fearing that the right wing government may kill the child rather than lose face, the only hope is to somehow smuggle the lady to the safety of a scientific community that live at sea. However the political power and symbolic meaning of a pregnant lady are a lure for many enemies and the path will not be easy. \r\n</p><p>\r\nFans of science fiction films will tend to agree that the movies for a particular era normally reflect the socio-political tensions for that era. If that is true what does this film say about the modern day? \r\n</p><p>\r\n<i>Children of Men</i> presents a simple if frightening concept, global infertility, and explores the consequences of that concept. It doesn't hold back in showing the lengths mankind will go to for its own selfish needs and some of the violence is so visceral you find yourself cowering in your seat. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDirector Alfonso Cuarn (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkeban) has once again demonstrated that he is not afraid of pushing the envelope. Filmed in a bleak colour scheme reflective of mankind's decline, and sparing the audience little rest from the imminent danger, this film manages to ramp up the tension without shying from the story. Unlike most big budget films you do not sit comfortably confident that there will be a happy ending as each gentle moment is shattered by a change in direction.\r\n</p><p>\r\nClive Owen once again immerses himself in his character making Theo very real and in doing so brings Theo closer to the audience. There are some strong emotions and some dark moments in this movie and Owen's acting doesn't falter. Fingers crossed come Oscar time that Britain may have a nomination in best actor. Alongside Owen, Claire-Hope Ashitey (Shooting Dogs) plays Kee, the lone pregnant lady at the centre of the plot. Relatively new to screens she offers occasional wit to an otherwise demanding role. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIn support, the iconic Michael Caine brought some much needed humour to proceedings as reclusive former satirist who provides shelter for the heroes in a time of need. By contrast Chiwetel Ejiofor (Inside Man) plays a deluded political radical who puts his groups interests ahead of his morality and offers unstable danger to proceedings. Ejiofor has cropped up in loads of films over the last few years and is always good, hopefully he'll find centre stage soon and may finally gain the recognition he deserves.\r\n</p><p>\r\n<i>Children of Men</i> is an aggressive emotional science fiction movie the likes of which we haven't seen for some time. For that reason if no other it deserves credit but it can also boast fine acting and very good direction. Maybe not the happiest film you'll see this year but probably one of the more memorable among the mire of remakes and sequels. \r\n</p>	4	2011-03-26	369	2011-03-26
370	1	12	\N	DOA - Dead or Alive	<p>\r\nAfter the countless computer/console game adaptations that have tanked at the box office, one would have thought that Hollywood executives had learnt their lesson by now. A few have been acceptable despite bearing little resemblance to their source material (<i>Resident Evil</i>), but the vast majority have been so bad that they happily vanished without trace, usually via DVD hell (<i>House Of The Dead</i>, or any other film by Uwe Boll for that matter). <i>Street Fighter:The Movie</i> was indeed so awful that Raul Julia is probably still cringing in his grave over his unplanned epitaph, so expectations for this particular beat-em-up adaptation were low to say the least. It came as something of a shock to discover that <i>DOA: Dead Or Alive</i> is actually quite entertaining.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAnyone who has seen the Holly Valance trailer will know what to expect - scantily clad women engaged in wire-fu action and <i>Charlie's Angels</i>-style hijinks. Eric Roberts sleep-walks his way through as the Kill Bill-esque villain, and though male characters from the game do feature, they mainly serve as punching bags for the trio of female leads, Princess Kasumi (Devon Aoki - <i>Sin City</i>), Christie (Holly Valance - <i>Neighbours [TV]</i>), and Tina (Jamie Pressley - <i>My Name Is Earl [TV]</i>). \r\n</p><p>\r\nFans of the DOA games will be pleased to hear that there is a beach volleyball scene for no sensible plot reason at all, as well as some kind of wet t-shirt competition fight between two of the ladies.\r\nThat scene pretty much encompasses the film right there.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe story is ridiculous, the dialogue is laughably overblown, and the fight scenes are hyper-edited to the point where pure CGI could have been used and no one would have been able to notice. It also manages to go beyond the usual short-cut of casting Chinese actors to play Japanese people, by casting a Westerner as a female ninja. While she is indeed beautiful enough to be in the film, Natassia Malthe is not remotely Asian looking.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAnd yet.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe exploitation is all so blatantly tongue-in-cheek that the film transcends its weaknesses (and let's face it, there are many), and confidently strides into big, dumb entertainment territory with a shit-eating grin on its face. Moments of utter genius such as Valance landing astride her motorbike and flashing her panties before her coat drops down cannot be denied, and any film featuring martial art skills being bestowed upon a man through the power of Ninja Sunglasses is simply too awesome for words. \r\n</p><p>\r\nNo doubt this film will tank alongside all of the other computer-to-film conversions but it is far more worthy than the dreadful <i>Resident Evil</i> sequel to name just one. Lastly, for the nay-sayers heckling at the back, this film isn't just for the titillation of teenage boys: two ladies in my test group thought that it was great fun, so there.\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	370	2011-03-26
371	1	15	\N	Right At Your Door	<p>Since the advent of live 24-hour news channels the public has been able to follow breaking news stories with such immediacy that the viewer can often feel as if they are caught up in the events directly. No story in recent years has illustrated this better than the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 where millions of television viewers bore witness to each new development as it happened, as if they were walking the streets of Manhattan themselves and not watching through a screen. \r\n</p><p>\r\nRight at your Door tries to recapture the panic and confusion of a terrorist attack and how it affects not those at the centre of the disaster, the victims and emergency workers, but those on the periphery who don't know the fates of their loved ones. \r\n</p><p>\r\nLexi (Mary McCormack - The West Wing [TV]) and Brad (Rory Cochrane - A Scanner Darkly) are a married couple living in the suburbs of Los Angeles. Like any normal day Lexi drives to work in the city centre while her husband stays at home, normal that is until the radio announces that explosives have been detonated all across Los Angeles. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWith the phone system in chaos and Brad unable to reach his wife, he sets off by car in the direction Lexi took to work trying to circumnavigate the police who are blocking his route to the carnage. Forced to return to his home Brad then hears a frightening new development. Terrorists have managed to detonate dirty bombs in the city and lethal chemicals are now falling among the ash from the explosions. \r\n</p><p>\r\nFearing his wife killed in the attacks Brad follows the advice of the authorities and isolates his home from the tainted air outside. It is only once the house is sealed tight that his wife staggers home covered in dust from the explosion. There she finds the doors and windows locked and her husband refusing to let her in. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWith an initially interesting premise and a realistic, gritty feel to the proceedings, Right at your Door seemed to offer a satisfying alternative to Oliver Stone's big budget tribute to the emergency workers who gave their lives in the twin towers. Unfortunately much like watching rolling news for too long this story quickly gets repetitive when no new developments are forthcoming. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSitting through an hour of Lexi alternating between crying and coughing on the patio wasn't the edge of the seat tension I was expecting. In desperation the plot introduces various intruders into the couples back garden but each investigation of the potentially threatening figures reveals only small children, members of the authorities or family friends. None of them add anything except minutes to the film's running time. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhat should really hold the audiences attention is the two central performances, but neither character ever comes to life. How they react to the dramatic circumstances in which they find themselves, and, more importantly, how they deal with Brad's decision to leave his wife outside among the fallout is great material to explore but these conflicts are quickly spent. Instead the filmmakers tread water for a lengthy period until they unleash their twist ending on a complacent audience, a twist ending which frankly isn't too hard to guess when you know that there is a twist ending. So I'm sorry I mentioned it, but the adverts did so first!</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	371	2011-03-26
372	1	15	\N	Severance	<p>Director Christopher Smith's first film, <i>Creep</i>, proved to be the most unintentionally hilarious horror film I have ever seen. For an encore Smith has decided to stick with the horror genre but this time tried to generate some laughs by design. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSeverance is a wish-fulfillment fantasy for everyone out there who has ever dreamed of visiting painful deaths on their work colleagues. \r\n</p><p>\r\nStaffed with all those irritating stock personalities that every office around the country seems to have, the employees of Palisade Defence get turned into mincemeat while on a corporate jolly in Eastern Europe by a unit of well armed war criminals. While the project may have been a piece of genius if only Ricky Gervais had been put in charge, Severance is a weak attempt at both genres it takes a stab at. \r\n</p><p>\r\nGenuine comedy is few and far between, relying instead on the absurdness of the situation the wimpish characters find themselves in to generate laughs. Meanwhile the horror plot is plodding even for a film with a running time of only ninety minutes. Far too much time is spent with individual members of the team wandering off alone discovering nothing of any interest. Maintaining a tense atmosphere can be tough even if the jokes are all falling flat. The setting is indistinct; a shack surrounded by leafy woodland that represents the wilds of the Balkans and the order of deaths follow a very predictable sequence. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDanny Dyer plays a character almost identical to his laddish roles in The Football Factory and The Business. It is a personality that hugely grates on me. Tim McInnerny (Blackadder [TV]) and Toby Stephens (Die Another Day) are the two most high profile members of the supporting cast doing their best to distract from Dyer's oafish characteristics. Laura Harris (The Faculty) plays the token American on the team and various other actors knock about in the background before being immolated or shot. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSeverance's adolescent humour will no doubt help it find some sort of audience, but it doesn't have the wit or inventiveness to come even close to the success of Shaun of the Dead while as horror it's practically toothless.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	372	2011-03-26
373	1	20	\N	Clerks II	<p>\r\nBack in 1995 new director Kevin Smith (Jersey Girl) filmed a little black comedy that slowly grew to become a cult classic launching his career. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe story focused on a twenty something guy named Dante (Brian O'Halloran) who was over educated and under employed, working as a clerk in his local convenience store. Dante was upset with his lot and was neglecting his great girlfriend by pining for his beautiful ex. Helping or hindering him through a nightmare day was his offensive epicurean friend Randall (Jeff Anderson) who occasionally worked in the video store next door.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter nearly a decade away from our screens we can once again join Dante and Randall. At the beginning of the film they encounter a small disaster when the convenience store burns down forcing them to work in the local Mooby's fast food outlet. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter a year at Mooby's we rejoin Dante as he prepares to wed a wealthy and beautiful woman and move to Florida. At last Dante feels he may escape New Jersey but in the next 24 hours he will be forced to re-evaluate what is important in his life. Meanwhile Randall drifts on like normal finding entertainment by victimising his young colleague Elias, a die hard Transformers and Lord of the Rings fan.\r\n</p><p>\r\n<i>Clerks</i> is crammed with pop culture references and fantastic dialogue. It is a bit of a nerdy comedy that appealed more to film fans and especially anyone who enjoys popcorn science fiction like Star Wars. Needless to say I was a huge fan of Clerks and revere it as a comedy classic. I have enjoyed many of Kevin Smith's recent films, especially Dogma, but news of a Clerks sequel worried me.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThankfully Clerks II is a really good movie in its own right. It contained a few jokes that follow on from the original but not so many that it couldn't stand by itself, similarly it didn't try to emulate the first film instead it matured contrary to its characters. There are still loads of great pop culture references including a particular funny attack on 'Lord of the Rings', as well as some great situation comedy and mountains of sexual innuendo.\r\n</p><p>\r\nJoining Brian O'Halloran as Dante, and Jeff Anderson as Randall, Rosario Dawson is mesmerising as the sexy Mooby Manageress Becky. Dawson is both sexy and funny working well alongside the established male cast. Waif like Trevor Fehrman is also hilarious as weedy Elias who is easy prey for the merciless sadistic Randall. In support of this primary cast the Clerks Alumni is completed by Jason Mewes (Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back) once again as dope dealing drop out Jay and Kevin Smith as Silent Bob. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe central story from Clerks, about the lack of direction many 20 something's feel, has been replaced by the mild panic that 30 something's feel as their responsibilities pile up. This simple back bone is nicely buried beneath a sordid comedy of errors and brilliantly offensive banter.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMany die hard 'Clerks' fans have attacked Kevin Smith for cashing in on his early classic. I needn't defend him too much as his own witty retorts surpass mine but if those fans can give this film a chance I think they'll really enjoy it.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn trying to find a recent comparator all I can think of is the woefully inadequate 'Waiting' that relied on jokes about foul food ingredients to fill out a two hour running time. Luckily 'Clerks II' shats all over 'Waiting' and even though it does have some memorable toilet humour it doesn't rely on it. \r\n</p><p>\r\nRecommended for fans of 'Clerks', 'Chasing Amy', 'Dogma' and '40 Year Old Virgin'. Welcome back Kevin Smith.\r\n</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	373	2011-03-26
377	1	15	\N	Saw III	<p>Considering the large number of horror films knocked out each year, classic examples of the genre tend to be something of an endangered species. A precious few stand out as a cut above the rest and survive beyond their opening weekend at the multiplex. \r\n</p><p>\r\nPrevious decades have given us <i>The Exorcist</i>, <i>Halloween</i> and <i>Alien</i>, examples of great horror pictures that have stood the test of time. The horror franchise that defined the nineties was Wes Craven's <i>Scream</i> Trilogy. Until this serial killer made his first sinister phone call, horror was in the doldrums, but then with a sly wink and plenty of scares Craven revitalised the slasher flick for all those jaded by years of ambition-free efforts. <i>Scream</i> was all too aware of the ridiculous nature of most horror films and used this knowledge to its advantage; it managed to mix characterisation, comedy and jumps to decent effect over three films. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWith over half of this decade already gone horror films currently tend to be part of one of two camps, the psychological eastern horrors (and their western remakes) and the splatter films like those made by Eli Roth. Of this second group the <i>Saw</i> franchise, which has now managed to churn out a picture three Halloweens in a row, has been the most successful. \r\n</p><p>\r\nUnfortunately <i>Saw III</i> has none of the attributes that made <i>Scream</i> a good film. Despite some truly hideous deaths it is not in the least bit frightening. Attempts at characterisation have sunk so low that the victims are given one-line introductions before being killed off. And as for laughs, that really depends on whether your find someone drowning in liquefied rotting pig funny? \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe two principal heroes this time around are a grieving father trapped in a warehouse of death and a doctor who is given the challenge of keeping the terminally ill Jigsaw killer alive or having her head blown off. Neither are remotely interesting people nor do their characters develop but then again that isn't surprising since they aren't the film's main characters. \r\n</p><p>\r\nTaking centre stage instead are serial killer Jigsaw (Tobin Bell - um, other Saw films) and his loopy protg Amanda (Shawnee Smith - The Island), who seems to be having some trust issues as the new girl on the block prepares to inherit her bedridden boss' mantle. \r\n</p><p>\r\nRather shockingly <i>Saw III</i> pushes the depravity well beyond the limits set by Roth's Hostel earlier in the year. The first fifteen minutes feature a policeman smashing his own foot to pulp, an ex-convict tearing loose chains that are looped through his skin and finally a woman secured in a harness has her rib cage ripped apart after dipping her hand in acid. Easy viewing this is not and I simply can't see the point of it. It is the cinematic equivalent of watching a child torture insects for an hour and a half. \r\n</p><p>\r\nGood horror films are like theme park roller coasters, they might scare you shitless but in the end you come out having enjoyed the experience. The only quality Saw III shares with a theme park ride is that by the end it might make you want to vomit.\r\n</p>	1	2011-03-26	377	2011-03-26
381	1	20	\N	The Prestige	<p>From the director of <b><i>'Batman Begins'</i></b> comes a dark thriller about rival magicians in nineteenth century London.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAt the beginning of the film we watch as the cold and calculating Alfred Borden (Christian Bale - Harsh Times) sneaks behind stage and witnesses rival magician Robert "The Great Danton" Angier (Hugh Jackman - X-Men 3) drown in a water tank when an illusion goes disastrously wrong.\r\n</p><p>\r\nCharged with murder, Borden finds himself in court. As evidence is heard we meet illusionist engineer Cutter (Michael Caine -Batman Begins) who defends the sanctity of magic tricks so that he may speak alone with the judge. \r\n</p><p>\r\nReminiscing over his career and his frequent confrontations with The Great Danton, Borden reads through the journal of his deceased nemesis and learns new insights into the man's personality. This leads us into a series of flashbacks narrating the life of Angier and his obsessions. Meanwhile in those flashbacks we watch as Angier reads through the notebook of Borden, stolen for him by a mutual acquaintance. \r\n</p><p>\r\nTold in parallel with brief leaps to the present and the past the flow of the film is nicely broken up allowing for some dramatic and unexpected twists. The three principal characters, Borden, Angier, and\r\nCutter are well acted and well developed, dragging the audience into the mystery of each rival's obsessions and magic.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAt first I thought Christian Bale's Cockney accent was a bit off key but soon it settles into your mind and you accept it. Bale is very good at playing cold, calculating characters and with the role of under privileged and misunderstood genius Borden, he gets to further increase his impressive CV. The role of a magician and showman requires flair and style, the role of villain requires animal aggression, and the role of the condemned requires humbleness. \r\n</p><p>\r\nOn the flip side Jackman finally manages to play a leading role that is strikingly dissimilar to his stereotype 'Wolverine' antihero. Essentially the same character as Borden albeit wealthier, Angier suffers a tragic loss early in the film and becomes obsessed with both revenge \r\nand fame. As these desires consume his character Jackman makes a good connection with the audience who at first sympathise but then begin to doubt him, a great performance.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn support there are numerous great stars including the ever beautiful Scarlett Johansson (The Black Dahlia) as each magician's female assistant and Rebecca Hall (newcomer) as the neglected wife of Borden, however special mention must be made for Michael Caine and a certain rock star.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMichael Caine has had a long and excellent career in movies despite many critics ridiculing his choice of parts. In the Prestige Caine offers a unique perspective of each of the two rival magicians and gives an insight into some of the great magic tricks. He is always good and once again he slips into the role like a pair of comfy slippers and you don't doubt that he actually is a magician's engineer. \r\n</p><p>\r\nRock star? Yes, indeed there is a classic rock star in this movie who has previously had a stab or two at acting with mixed success. David Bowie stars as Tesla, the real life famous Serb-American inventor credited with the invention and study of alternating current. In <i>The Prestige</i> Bowie portrays the scientist as a quiet reclusive man with a genius intellect mixed with a philosophical mind. Although it's only a small role, the character is fantastic and Bowie, not famed for his acting, puts in a good stab and manages to become a highlight of the second act along with his sidekick Andy Serkis (King Kong).\r\n</p><p>\r\nDirector Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins, Insomnia) once again demonstrates his ability to call the shots on set. <i>The Prestige</i> is very dark and well paced and even if the audience may see one or two of the twists coming, they will still get surprised by some of the others. Magic tricks have always mystified so a modern movie that doesn't rely on special effects and instead returns to simple illusion is both refreshing and entertaining. Once again the director manages to keep the pace moving and the audience gripped even when he experiments with the chronology of events.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThis is a great movie that thankfully ends what has been a rather dull autumn and bodes well for the winter movies ahead. Dark and atmospheric, this is strongly recommended for fans of <i>Batman Begins</i>, <i>Hitchcock movies</i>, <i>Bram Stoker's Dracula</i> and <i>Frankenstein</i> (but not the woefully inadequate <i>VanHelsing</i>).\r\n</p>	4	2011-03-26	381	2011-03-26
382	1	15	\N	The Queen	<p>\r\nShortly before midnight on August 30th 1997, the car carrying Diana Princess of Wales lost control on a Paris road and crashed. The following morning the world woke to the news that Diana was dead and over the week that followed, amid scenes of growing anger from ordinary people, the monarchy's very future was put in jeopardy by its refusal to respond publicly to the tragedy. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDirector Stephen Frears' The Queen portrays the events of those extraordinary few days, through the eyes of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren - Gosford Park) as well as her newly elected Prime Minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen - Kingdom of Heaven). \r\n</p><p>\r\nQueen Elizabeth, for the first time in her reign, finds herself out of step with her public, unable to reconcile her private experiences of a woman whom she found to be difficult, with the publics' perception of Diana as someone almost approaching sainthood. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe Queen sees her former daughter in law's death as simply a family matter, her first concern is the well being of her grandchildren. Meanwhile the young pretender Tony Blair, much more adept at judging the current public mood, recognises that events have taken on a national dimension that the Queen simply refuses to acknowledge. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAs the crisis escalates Queen Elizabeth turns to her mother and husband for advice rather than following Blair's suggestions while back in London Blair's republican wife advocates that the Prime Minister should leave the House of Windsor to its fate. \r\n</p><p>\r\nMirren, never one to put in an average performance, locks up the Oscar for Best Actress six months early. Her performance respectfully reveals so much about the private character of this very public figure that you will likely never see the real Her Majesty in the same light again. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhile Helen Mirren is rightly receiving a host of plaudits, Michael Sheen's contribution to the film should not be overshadowed. Like the leading lady, Sheen assumes Blair's mannerisms and vocal style but never lets his performance drift towards impersonation. His portrayal is generally flattering, which may infuriate Blair's present day opponents, but like all the public figures that take the stage during this national drama he too is a flawed figure. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe supporting cast is well stocked with forthright and amusing performances further enhanced by the fact that they are all too believable. Prince Philip (James Cromwell - LA Confidential) is a relic of empire who puts his faith in the restorative powers of fresh air above all else while Cherie Blair (Helen McCrory - Casanova) is an intellectual snob who chastises her husband for his growing respect for tradition. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhile The Queen, is a fictional retelling of what went on behind the scenes during one of the most extraordinary weeks in recent history, it bases much of its events on the recollections of some of those who were present. Certainly artistic licence is used at times but the filmmakers can be forgiven for conjuring a film that is both poignant, funny and undoubtedly the British film of the year\r\n</p>	5	2011-03-26	382	2011-03-26
384	1	15	\N	Stick It	<p>The sports movie, frankly, is a tired genre. Invariably whiney teens from underprivileged backgrounds overcome adversity to discover hidden depths of talent in their chosen activity (Gridiron / Ice Hockey / Tiddly Winks / Whatever) and learn important life lessons along the way. It would take something special to make me sit through another tedious rehash of the same-old feel good nonsense. Yes, you've guessed it - leotards! \r\n</p><p>\r\nStick It takes place in the high octane world of female gymnastics, a world where no contortion is impossible and no camera angle too invasive. Haley Graham (Missy Peregrym) is your typical rebellious Amazonian teenage gymnast. Ever since she walked out on team USA during the World Championship Finals she has been a pariah in the gymnastic sporting community and, despite her enormous talent, Hayley now spends her time doing tricks on her bike in empty swimming pools. \r\n</p><p>\r\nHer sullen exile comes to an end however when, after breaking an extraordinarily expensive glass patio door, she is arrested for criminal damage and given two alternatives to juvenile detention, Texas Military School or, even more terrifying, a stay in an elite gymnastics academy run by Burt Vickerman (Jeff Bridges - Blown Away). \r\n</p><p>\r\nHaley naturally picks military school but the judge has a sense of humour and packs her off to Burt and his villainous regime of handstands till your wrists are sore. \r\n</p><p>\r\nYoung teenage girls will love this fluff where the plucky (irritating) beauty (freakishly strong) gets to (irresponsibly) break all the rules and triumphantly find her place in the world (a trampoline). As for everyone else, they probably won't be bored thanks to strong performances from both Bridges and Peregrym and also some fantastic gymnastic sequences where the main characters show some astonishing flexibility. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSadly the last twenty minutes cock up the staple moment in all sports movies, the bit where the main character takes on her strongest adversary on the big stage. Hayley does have to compete against her former world championship teammate at the National Finals but instead of gymnastic armageddon the finale gets bogged down in some confusing protest about the trivialities of competition scoring. No one will care and all the tension generated for the big showdown is flushed away. It's almost as if the filmmakers have never seen <i>The Karate Kid</i>!\r\n</P>	2	2011-03-26	384	2011-03-26
387	1	20	\N	Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny	<p>\r\nAfter a string of successful movies the studio dudes have allowed Jack Black to vent his frenetic comedy and love of Rock. Showcased in the modern classic <i> 'School of Rock'</i> and briefly witnessed in the earlier <i>'High Fidelity'</i>, Jack Black has been giving hints of his musical talent in many of his roles but now he is unleashed.\r\n</p><p>\r\n<i><b>'Tenacious D: The Pick of Destiny'</i></b> tells the story of a nave but gifted guitarist, JB (Jack Black) who rebels against his parents and hits the road on a mission to learn Rock and form the greatest rock band in the world.\r\n</p><p>\r\nEventually drifting onto the laid back broadwalk of Venice Beach, JB stumbles upon a fantastic guitarist, KG, (Kyle Gass - Elf) who at first rejects his pleas for tutelage. After a touching moment with a gang of Kubrick fans, KG decides to take JB under his wing and teach him the ways of Rock.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter exercises, power slides and gig simulations, JB learns that KG is no more a rock genius than he is and that they are both out of cash. Could this be the end of the road? NO! In an effort to raise money they audition for a local talent contest, only one problem, they need material (and talent).\r\n</p><p>\r\nIt is at this early stage that fate gives them a helping hand. KG notices that the lead guitarists of several rock legends all shared the same guitar pick. A brief bit of investigating and they stumble upon an ancient dark secret, the eponymous 'Pick of Destiny'. He who holds the pick will play the greatest music and shall find fame, fortune, sex, drugs, everything they ever wanted.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMotivated and unphased by the challenge involved, KG and JB set off on a madcap adventure to find the pick and win the tournament. Along the way there are numerous amusing mishaps, drug induced flights of fancy and high speed car chases rounded off with a fight to save all humanity.\r\n</p><P>\r\nFans of insane comedy quests such as <i>'Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey'</i> or 'Harold and Kumar get the Munchies' will definitely love this movie. It doesn't take itself seriously and therefore doesn't need to try.  It's just great comedy from start to finish. The musical opening sequence with a young JB confronting his puritan father (Meatloaf) is particularly fantastic.\r\n</p><p>\r\nI've said enough, go and watch it!!!\r\n</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	387	2011-03-26
389	1	16	\N	Flushed Away	<p>\r\nPosh rat Roddy (voice by Hugh Jackman - The Prestige) is living the high life in the leafy suburbs of Kensington.  He has a sparkling gold cage and when his owners leave on holiday, Roddy has the run of the house!  \r\n</p><p>\r\nOne day his tranquil home is rudely disturbed by the unwelcome arrival of dirty rat Sid (voice by Shane Richie - EastEnders [TV]).  Sid decides he now rules the roost and either Roddy can become his personal butler or get out. Roddy has an idea of his own to get rid of Sid once and for all.\r\n</p><p>\r\nUnfortunately Roddy's plan backfires and he is sent hurtling down the toilet towards the mucky and murky waters of the sewers. How is an uptown rat like Roddy supposed to survive with the lowlifes in the sewers?\r\n</p><p>\r\nRoddy is determined to return to his lavish lifestyle 'up top' and he bumps into skipper Rita (voice by Kate Winslet - Little Children) who he is hoping will give him a ride home.  Thanks to Roddy's clumsiness, Rita ends up being captured by a group of thugs who are on a mission to recover a precious jewel.\r\n</p><p>\r\nRita and Roddy are dragged in front of kingpin 'The Toad' (voice by Ian McKellen - The Da Vinci Code) who demands to have the jewel returned.  The Toad triumphs when Roddy gives up Rita's secret.  As the rats escape, Rita grabs a cable lead on her way out.  She is fuming with Roddy for giving The Toad her jewel and he has a lot to do to make it up to her.\r\n</p><p>\r\nRoddy decides to make a deal with Rita.  If she can get him home, he will give her replacement jewels so she can make sure her family are looked after.  Rita agrees and the pair embark on a hair raising adventure to Kensington.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMeanwhile, The Toad is furious that Rita has stolen his prized possession - a cable lead?!  It is part of a bigger dastardly plan to flush away the sewer city and rid his kingdom of the rodent population.  Without the cable, his plan is ruined.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn a bid to retrieve the cable, The Toad orders his trusty French cousin 'Le Frog' (voice by Jean Reno - The Da Vinci Code) and his team of ninja frogs to find Rita and snatch the cable back.\r\n</p><p>\r\nLet the chase commence...\r\n</p><p>\r\nThis film boasts some top names voicing the characters in this fun-filled adventure.  Jackson provides suave sophistication for Roddy while Winslet adds girl power and independence for Rita.  Watch out for comedy character voices from McKellen as bellowing 'The Toad' and witty sharp-tongued dialogue from Reno's 'Le Frog'.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFlushed Away is highly reminiscent of Aardman's previous animation projects and is bound to follow the successful track record.  It is an entertaining movie filled with fun, laughter and singing slugs!  A must see for children and adults alike.\r\n</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	389	2011-03-26
390	1	20	\N	Stranger Than Fiction	<p>\r\nAn everyday tax man, Harold (Will Ferrell - Blades of Glory) lives a dull and unexciting life. One day while cleaning his teeth Harold starts to hear a female voice narrating his life. The voice foretells his imminent doom. Across town a famous neurotic author, Karen (Emma Thompson - Nanny McPhee) is having difficulty with her latest book; she needs to find a way to kill off her latest character creation, Harold.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAs the movie progresses we see these two disparate characters confronting obstacles in their lives as they slowly move toward a conclusion. Harold hopes to find the source of the narration so he may ask for more life and turns to a literary expert Professor Jules Herbert (Dustin Hoffman - Perfume) for help. Along the way he finds love in the unexpected form of a rebellious cookie maker Ana (Maggie Gyllenhaal - World Trade Centre). Meanwhile reclusive author Karen struggles with her neuroses and depression by lashing out at her new persistent PA, Penny (Queen Latifah - Ice Age 2), sent by the publishers to inspire or compel Karen to finish her book.  Karen and Penny share little in common other than a desire to finish the book and soon they strike up a curious friendship.\r\n</p><p>\r\nStranger than Fiction has a simple comedy concept that it deepens with some emotional concepts and a bit of exploration into humanity. The comedy is driven by imminent tragedy and that makes the film both entertaining and thought provoking. If that sounds a little deep and heavy for a comedy, it is a little light on gags in certain places but 'as is life'. This is a nice heartfelt story that translates into great cinema.\r\nCentral to the success of this movie is the acting. Without exception each player performs perfectly making the characters both convincing and engaging. The reality of these characters contrasting with the story's surreal premise makes for a great movie and hence five stars.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWill Ferrell plays the quiet and inward Harold Crick. In a straight role Ferrell shows that beneath his usual madcap antics he has the ability to act. Some of his scenes pack an emotional punch unexpected from his usual lunacy and this film, sadly missed by many, is a career highlight. \r\n</p><p>\r\nEmma Thompson is as always captivating as the nicotine addled Karen and her acidic swipes at defiant Latifah, herself on good form, contain moments of excellence. Completing the exceptional cast, Hoffman proves himself a good choice as Professor Herbert and plays the role so relaxed it is like a walk in the park and Maggie Gyllenhaal adds sex appeal as the love interest for Harold. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhat do you do if you know you are going to die in a few days? Do you quit work and go for a holiday? Do you buy a gun and take your enemies with you? Do you rob a bank and live like a king on the gains? Meanwhile, what do you do when you realise your fictitious creations appear to be real, question your mind? Feel the blood on your hands for all those other characters you killed? Well... you have got to laugh in the end haven't you? Now sing along, "Always look on the bright side of life...."\r\n</p><p>\r\nThis film is a lesser known comedy concept classic that any self respecting movie fan should see. I'd recommend this for fans of <i>'The Life Aquatic'</i>, <i>'I Heart Huckabees'</i> and curiously enough <i>'Bladerunner'</i> and <i>'A Scanner Darkly'</i>. \r\n</p>	5	2011-03-26	390	2011-03-26
391	1	7	\N	Happy Feet	<p>\r\n\r\nGrease on ice? An inconvenient truth about fish? This animated movie aims to provide something to please every member of the family but only just manages to hold its plot together with a toe-tapping baseline.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nSet in the icy world of the Emperor penguin, we learn that music is the way to attract a mate. Sadly our hero Mumble (voice by Elijah Wood - Sin City) cannot sing a note but seems to express himself by tap dancing. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nMumble is an embarrassment to his father (voice by Hugh Jackman - Flushed Away) and ridiculed by his peers.  Only his mother Norma Jean (voice by Nicole Kidman - Bewitched) and childhood friend Gloria (voice by Brittany Murphy - Sin City) have any respect for his "hippity-hoppity" ways.  Mumble is persuaded that his dancing is actually rather cool when he stumbles across a group of smaller and apparently Latino (yes, really!) penguins fronted by Ramon (voice by Robin Williams - RV).  \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nWhen the supply of fish unexpectedly dries up, the leader of the emperor penguins concludes that Mumble must be the cause, angering the gods with his un-penguin habits.  With biblical overtones, Mumble is ostracised from his flock and sets off on a quest to find the real cause of the fish drought.  \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nFrom a jolly coming-of age plot familiar to all American teen movie audiences, the film takes a darker turn as Mumble and his Amigos venture into the unknown to find the 'aliens' whose trawler fishing has depleted the fish stocks.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThe studios behind the animated movies have realised that something new is needed in the format and this movie has both a family friendly coming of age story with a dash of romance, mixed in with a more serious environmental message.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThe vocal talent is on top form throughout especially considering the amount of singing in the early scenes and a special mention should be made for Robin Williams who voiced three separate characters. \r\n</p><p>\r\nFun and at times a little scary, this is an entertaining animated movie recommended for fans of <i>Madagascar</i>, <i>The Lion King</i> and <i>Finding Nemo</i>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n	3	2011-03-26	391	2011-03-26
393	1	16	\N	The Holiday	<p>\r\nTwo girls, world's apart with the Atlantic Ocean separating them, are struggling with similar personal problems.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nBoth Amanda (Cameron Diaz - In Her Shoes) and Iris (Kate Winslet - Little Children) have been duped by their boyfriends who claim to be faithful but it turns out they have been playing away from home.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFilm trailer producer Amanda is a headstrong and independent woman who hasn't cried since she was a teenager so to her the break up is no big deal.  Iris, on the other hand, is much more sensitive and is heartbroken to hear that her ex Jasper (Rufus Sewell - Tristan and Isolde) is engaged to a female colleague.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe women decide to cut their losses and head off on vacation for a fresh start for Christmas.  Amanda comes across a home exchange website and sends an enquiry to check availability.  Iris happens to be the recipient and she decides to stop moping about the house and agrees to the offer.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe women agree to swap homes for two weeks including cars, pets and friends!  Amanda sets off to the snowy English countryside of Surrey while Iris packs her swimming cossie for sunny LA!\r\n</p><p>\r\nBefore they know it the women become immersed in their new lives.  By chance Amanda bumps into Iris' good-looking brother Graham (Jude Law - Alfie).  There is an instant attraction and they waste no time in getting to know one another better.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAcross the pond, Iris is lapping up the life of luxury in Amanda's swanky LA pad.  Not knowing many people, she befriends her neighbour Arthur (Eli Wallach - Mystic River) who has a fascinating career history to share with her.  She also has a visit from Amanda's work friend and musical genius Miles (Jack Black - Tenacious D) who she hits it off with straight away.\r\n</p><p>\r\nLove and friendship were the last things Amanda and Iris were looking for in their new homes but the girls embrace their new surroundings and lives.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWhen the two-week period is up, the women find it very difficult to break away from their new lives and return to the hassles they left behind.\r\n</p><p>\r\nDiaz and Winslet are great in their respective roles.

394	1	15	\N	Eragon	<p>\r\nA beautiful princess steals a precious treasure from the evil Empire that rules over all the land. She tries to spirit it away to the secret base of the rebels who oppose the forces of darkness but is ambushed en route by the Empire's sinister agent, the wielder of an ancient magic. The princess is captured but not before she manages to transport her cargo into the hands of a sheltered farm boy who lives with his uncle. \r\n</p><p>\r\nPursued by soldiers of the King, who have destroyed his home in search of the stolen object, our teenage hero is taken under the wing of a grizzled old wanderer who teaches the boy magic and helps him on his quest to save the princess and reach the rebels. Yes, you're not imagining it. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThis plot does have an eerily familiar ring to it. Author Christopher Paolini was only fifteen when he began to write <i>Star Wars with Dragons</i>, so can be forgiven for making a mint from the undiscerning teens who bought his book and didn't know any better. Exactly what 20th Century Fox are playing at by funding this, considering their association with the Star Wars films, is the real worry. Presumably they saw the phrase 'epic fantasy trilogy' associated with the books and thought they had the next <i>Lord of the Rings</i> on their hands. They don't. \r\n</p><p>\r\nEven though the film presumably cost a pretty penny to make everything about it feels cheap. The landscape that the cast wanders through is strictly small screen, the action pedestrian, and the script appalling. \r\n</p><p>\r\nEdward Speleers is lamentable as the joyless hero Eragon, the farmboy who discovers a dragon's egg in the woods. His acting is dire although John Malkovich (Rounders) gives him a run for his money in the diabolical stakes as the droning emperor. When a supposedly serious actor such as Malkovich can barely hide his disdain for the material you know the film is in trouble. Jeremy Irons (Kingdom of Heaven) lends some theatrical credibility to the Obi-Wan Kenobi figure of Brom, an old dragon rider who instructs Eragon in the ways of the Jedi, or something similar.  Irons certainly puts in more of a performance than Malkovich but sadly it isn't a good one. Only Sienna Guillory (Resident Evil Apocalypse) emerges with any credit as the graceful Arya and Robert Carlyle (Trainspotting) deserves an honourable mention for wearing a particularly silly wig and makeup combination that makes him look like a member of Kiss, and all the while still managing to retain some slight menace. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe dragon Saphira is beautifully designed, a jet propelled blur of blue that majestically sweeps through the skies and occasionally crashes back down to earth with noticeable weight. As an effect she is brilliantly realised and I particularly liked the fact she was feathered rather than scaled, but as a character she has a hideous flaw, Rachel Weisz (The Mummy) provides her with the voice of a middle class parent browsing for groceries in Sainsburys. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAudiences have been treated to a succession of high quality fantasy films over recent years from H<i>arry Potter</i> to <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i>, not to mention Peter Jackson's work on <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. In comparison Eragon is tedious, unimaginative and poorly executed. Don't expect to see further installments to this flop rearing their heads at cinemas in the future.\r\n</p>	1	2011-03-26	394	2011-03-26
396	1	20	\N	Casino Royale	<p>\r\n"Bond Is Back", the familiar cry when the James Bond franchise releases a new movie with a new leading man filling the shoes of 007. I remember when the absence of Bond ended with the arrival of Pierce Brosnan in <i>'Golden Eye'</i> and remember well the speculation leading up to that film's release of whether the star of TV's <i>'Sapphire and Steele'</i> could pull off the 'demanding' role of James Bond. Brosnan quickly wowed audiences and has been ranked by many as the second best Bond of all time after Sir Sean Connery himself (we will not get into a debate about who was the best Bond, I'm writing the review and I say it was Connery). So following the footsteps of Brosnan, MI6 newcomer Daniel Craig (Munich) had a lot to live up to. More of that later, first let me give a quick prcis of the film's story line.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSet shortly after James Bond's promotion to 007, effectively restarting the franchise, <i>Casino Royale</i> introduces a new untested Bond. Fresh from his training and his new promotion, James is in central Africa following a tip and hoping to catch a mercenary bomb maker. After a very exciting free-running chase sequence and some death defying antics Bond barely escapes a fracas at an embassy but manages to find one lead.\r\n</p><p>\r\nA few investigative steps further and following a brief tryst with a villain's informative wife, Bond is hot on the trail of terrorist financier 'Le Chiffre' (Mads Mikkelsen - King Arthur). James quickly thwarts the evil bean counter's plan which forces the financier to find a new and quick way to raise a huge amount of cash before getting killed by his own customers. Le Chiffre organises a high stakes poker tournament at the prestigious 'Casino Royale' and Bond joins the game to ensure things continue to run badly for the villain. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDoes that sound like a good start for the story? Well it continues and I don't want to ruin the film by exposing all the details of the various insidious plans (unlike a clich Bond villain of former years). \r\n</p><p>\r\n<i>'Casino Royale'</i> reinvents the Bond franchise by incorporating many long absent ideas and toning down some of the more fanciful elements that have dominated recent movies in the series. The one liners are still there but not too 'carry on' in their cheekiness; the gadgets are there but not so preposterous as to defy belief; the car is there and remains a car rather than a Swiss army knife on an acid trip. Also returning after many years is a credible story line where, for once, the fate of all humanity does not rely solely on the shoulders of one man, a plot that actually engages the audience. \r\n</p><p>\r\nYou may guess by my tone that I like this movie. I did. For a while I was watching Bond laughing at the absurdity of the plot lines and enjoying the adventures but with half a mind thinking that the series was in trouble. After the release of more realistic spy thrillers such as 'The Bourne Identity' and the successful '24' television series, I vocally hoped that Bond would take heed and sort his act out, thankfully the studio peeps were thinking the same.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe new Bond is not encumbered by countless gadgets and the action sequences return to real stunts rather than the unforgivable CGI iceberg surfing that disgraced the last movie. A combination of free-running (that dangerous stunt of running and leaping over roof tops seemingly immune from gravity or unphased by it) and unconventional high wire antics feature heavily in the early chase sequences. Car chases are still in the mix and remain as good as ever and anyone who enjoys the grittier fighting of the Bourne movies will enjoy Bond's frequent fracas with numerous henchmen.\r\n</p><p>\r\nDonning the dinner suit and taking up the role of Bond, blue eyed Daniel Craig was not everyone's first choice for looks. He is very different from Pierce Brosnan, not only in appearance but in his interpretation of Bond. This 007 is fiercer and more cold hearted than Brosnan yet, at the same time, Craig manages to keep the crucial element of cool needed to keep the role engaging and human. Verdicts will be split on Craig's Bond and where he will rank in the league of actors who have 'shot the camera', personally I think he did a good job and nicely banished my memories of his poor accent in <i>Munich</i>.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn support Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre is suitably cold as the mathematical genius sitting at the poker table and keeping Bond on his toes in more ways than one (ref. a nasty scene to keep us lads crossed legged for a while). Also putting in a small but entertaining performance Giancarlo Giannini (Man on Fire) props the casino bar up while helping Bond with inside intelligence and the cool Jeffrey Wright (Syriana) makes an appearance as Bond's new friend within the CIA, Felix Lieter. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThis leads us nicely to the women. Those lovely ladies that are needed to make any Bond film complete. In first place for acting but not necessarily one for a swimwear scene, Judi Dench (Pride & Prejudice) returns as M pulling the political strings (often to find them cut). Dench has made the role of M completely her own and once again keeps her wit and execution a notch above Bond even if he sometimes misbehaves. In the category for sexy and pointless diversion the winner is newcomer Caterina Murino playing a Latino hottie. Not much acting necessary for her role really, just needed the ability to look sexy in silk and Murino has that in oodles. \r\n</p><p>\r\nFinally, the long lost role of a sexy intelligent woman who steals the heart of Bond irrevocably changing his persona (last filled by Diana Rigg as Tracy Di Vicenzo back in 1969). Young starlet Eva Green stars as Vesper Lynd, a treasury officer assigned to oversee James Bond's gambling habit who finds herself drawn into the mayhem. Eva has already proven she can be sexy with her breakthrough performance in 'The Dreamers' (2003) and her role as Queen Sibylla in 'Kingdom of Heaven' (2005). Some say that Eva 'sold out' by agreeing to star in a Bond movie but I think she brings elegance and intelligence and I am sure her career will not be harmed, only helped, by her latest role.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWe are well into a second page here so I should round this off. Member of the Bond Director Alumni for his work on 'Golden Eye', Martin Campbell has brought a new lease of life to a tired franchise and has undoubtedly made the best Bond film in decades, better even than his first Bond movie. While we nerds go on debating Bond movies, this movie is raking it in at the box office and I hope the next Bond film, slated for 2008, will continue the new trend. Great action recommended to anyone and everyone!\r\n</p><p>\r\n<I> As long as this review is, I could rant about Bond films for hours. Bond movies epitomise the concept of 'Popcorn Cinema'. For my brief rant about Bond please scroll down.</I>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>\r\nMany people moan when they look at cinema listings and see numerous sequels on the menu. 'Sequels are never as good as the original', true in most instances. However these same people get excited about the new Bond movie. Sometimes you practically need to slap these peeps in the face to highlight their hypocrisy. Bond is the ultimate sequel generator currently enjoying the release of its 21st movie! (22nd if you include the original comedy 'Casino Royale' starring David Niven).\r\n</p><p>\r\nWhy so many movies? Which is the best one? Who is the sexiest? Who is the best Bond? We could debate and discuss for ages but as this is a one sided conversation and I'm tired of typing (contrary to the evident length of this page), here are my ratings for Bond.\r\n</p><p>\r\n<b>Best Bond:</B> 1st = Sean Connery, 2nd = Pierce Brosnan<br>\r\n<b>Best Movie:</b> Goldfinger (1964)<br>\r\n<b>Best Bond Girl: </b> Halle Berry (Die Another Day)<br>\r\n<b>Best Villain: </b> Zorin (View to a Kill)<br>\r\n<b>Best Dastardly Plan:</b> Moonraker (A Roman orgy in space to repopulate the earth once it has been decimated by orchids)<br>\r\n<b>Best Car: </b> Aston Martin DB5 (Goldfinger, Golden Eye and Casino Royale)<br>\r\n<b>Best Gadget: </b> Invisible Car (as if)<br>\r\n<b>Best Song: </b> Goldfinger (Sung by Shirley Bassey)<br>\r\n<b>Best Opening Nugget: </b>1st = Tomorrow Never Dies, 2nd = Octopussy<br>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	396	2011-03-26
397	1	15	\N	The Last Kiss	<p>Zach Braff (Garden State) has built his career playing twenty something adolescents struggling to make headway in life. His directorial debut, Garden State, was an indie gem sprinkled with quirky humour that played to the leading man's strengths. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe Last Kiss, with its similar themes, doesn't feel as fresh or inventive but, thanks largely to Braff's charm, it too is a very good picture. \r\n</p><p>\r\nMichael (Braff) is 29-years-old, a successful architect and is experiencing a crisis in his private life. His girlfriend of three years, Jenna (Jacinda Barrett - Poseidon), is smart, funny and Michael loves her but she is also three months pregnant and suddenly he is feeling scared, panicked and trapped.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFreedom presents itself in the smiley form of Kim (Rachel Bilson - The OC [TV]), a nubile college student who locks sight of Michael at a mutual friend's wedding and within two sentences of hello has him touching her chest so he can 'feel how fast her heart is beating.' \r\n</p><p>\r\nUnsurprisingly Michael's head is turned but when his dalliance puts his relationship with Jenna in jeopardy he must make a decision about what he really values in his life. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWomen will hate this film. All the male characters are hand wringing, commitment shy losers who run off to South America at the first sign of an emotional challenge. But the film supports them. It champions the fragile male mind and tells those in the audience that have the XY chromosome that they are not alone in wanting more. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe girlfriends, on the other hand, are portrayed as nagging, clingy or heartless. The only female that has an actual three-dimensional personality is Jenna and it is a very fetching personality as well. Michael is quite clearly a total idiot to even think about cheating on her, although in Bilson the casting director has certainly picked a tempting other woman. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWere it not for Braff's amazing ability to look so utterly miserable in the rain, I doubt he would have generated any sympathy with the audience at all. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe film, however, doesn't just follow Michael and Jenna's relationship. The most important subplot concerns Jenna's parents who are portrayed by Tom Wilkinson (The Patriot) and Blythe Danner (Meet the Parents). These members of the older generation still haven't got their relationship on safe ground even after thirty years of marriage. The pair effortlessly steals scenes from their younger co-stars as they dispense advice from positions of all too recent experience. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe Last Kiss is a gently funny film about relationships and growing up. Unlike most romantic comedies it has no contrived circumstance or ridiculous hook to sell itself with, but what it does have is a very likeable leading couple, a good script and some decent supporting performances. It makes for a good date film although men watching with their girlfriends would be wise to remember when leaving the cinema they should exclaim loudly that Michael is a cheating dog and that Jenna is clearly a saint.\r\n</p>	4	2011-03-26	397	2011-03-26
398	1	12	\N	Pans Labyrinth	<p>On watching the trailer to <i>Pan's Labyrinth</i>, one could be forgiven for expecting a fantasy along the lines of <i>Mirrormask</i>, or the similarly named Jennifer Connolly film <i>Labyrinth</i>. Young female protagonist - check! Fantasy world - check! Disturbing looking creatures - check! Psychotic fascist step-father - che... wait a minute. \r\n</p><p>\r\nGuillermo Del Toro's film is the latest in a series of independent, personal works funded by his occasional forays into Hollywood territory, such as <i>Blade 2</i> and <i>Hellboy</i>. Marking a return to the period of the Spanish Civil War, covered once before by Del Toro in <i>The Devil's Backbone</i>, <i>Pan's Labyrinth</i> could be considered a sister film to its predecessor, sharing certain themes and aspects while mirroring others.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe most noticeable of the inversions is that of the protagonist's gender. In place of a boy, there is Ofelia, a young girl obsessed with books and uninterested in the expectations of femininity placed upon her. Forced to accompany her pregnant mother to meet her new step-father, Captain Vidal, Ofelia discovers a ruined labyrinth and the faun that dwells there, Pan. He tells her that she is the reincarnation of the long-lost underworld princess, and that to return to her realm she must accomplish three tasks before the moon is full. Meanwhile, Vidal is ruthlessly pursuing a group of Loyalists who are hiding in the mountains after their defeat at the hands of General Franco. As the difficulty of Ofelia's tasks increases, so does the intensity of Vidal's skirmishes with the Loyalists, building up to an apocalyptic finish.\r\n</p><p>\r\nContrasting a child's fantasy with the grim realities of war is somewhat on the unique side, a mix of styles that sounds crazy in theory but one that works brilliantly in the hands of Del Toro. Laden with symbolism and metaphor to the point of implosion, the film explores the themes of adolescence, choice and destiny. "A princess who forgot who she was and where she came from", according to Del Toro, Ofelia undergoes a rite of passage involving hardship and difficult decisions, ones that she makes in spite of the restrictions placed upon her by her situation.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe labyrinth symbolises the plight of Ofelia's past life, as well as that of the other characters, such as the housekeeper Mercedes (Maribel Verd - Y tu mam tambin) and Vidal's personal doctor. Both are secretly supporting the rebellious Loyalists at the risk of their own lives, a rebellious choice made in defiance of the institutional lack of choice forced upon them by the fascist state, as personified by Vidal. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIvana Baquero as Ofelia is superb, and she is complemented by the entire cast who all perform admirably. Sergi Lpez, in particular, does very well to bring depth to the one-dimensional character of Vidal, an unrelenting sadist for the film's duration and thus probably the weakest link in an otherwise excellent story. Ofelia's mother is also somewhat underdeveloped, a tragic figure who does little other than to offer an anchor to Ofelia's past life.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe brutal nature of Vidal and his fights with the Maquis rebels is starkly different to, and yet parallels, that of the fantasy underworld that Ofelia explores in her quest. The creatures she encounters are visibly monstrous, but at the same time beautiful and other-worldly, possessing a splendour spawned from the mind of Del Toro's childhood nightmares and brought to life by skilled special effects. The film as a whole is a visually arresting experience, far darker than that of <i>Mirrormask</i> and with a greater sense of solidity and realism.\r\n</p><p>\r\n<i>Pan's Labyrinth</i> is emotionally gripping and powerful, one that seizes the imagination from the very start and refuses to let go even after the final scene. One of the best films of 2006, and well deserving of the Best Foreign Film Oscar.\r\n</p>	4	2011-03-26	398	2011-03-26
399	1	15	\N	Black Christmas	<p>\r\nLittle yellow Billy is not a happy child. His mother's attitude towards him varies between hating him so much she keeps him locked in the attic for a decade and loving him so much she does things that would emotionally scar blood relatives for life. No wonder he has issues and that's even before you take into account that the old dragon who gave birth to him murdered his beloved dad with a hammer right before his beady little eyes. \r\n</p><p>\r\nBilly takes revenge one snowy Christmas by chocking Mum to death with a string of fairy lights and thus gets a one-way ticket to the nut house. This nut house, however, suffers from shoddy construction work and only employs utter idiots, so Billy escapes and heads home to find that his old house has been taken over by a gaggle of buxom sorority girls who won't be having a silent night. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe word 'predictable' often crops up in the reviews for horror films but Black Christmas is so obvious it feels like it was made more than fifteen years ago. Every single horror clich is dragged out screaming into the light and not one of the basic rules of horror is even slightly bent, let alone broken. \r\n</p><p>\r\nUnsurprisingly Black Christmas is a remake, a remake no less of the 1974 original which laid down many of the horror rules that it so carefully conforms to. So yes, one girl does decide to check out that strange noise coming from the attic in the dark, by herself. Yes, those very pointy icicles hanging from the porch will feature later on in the movie (although I suspect an icicle falling from a height of about four feet wouldn't pick up enough velocity to penetrate bone but who am I to quibble at horror film logic). \r\n</p><p>\r\nAt times the acting is atrocious, particularly during the scenes in the prison but the main cast of girls are all decent enough for what is required of them. The problem, however, is there are just so many of them. Slasher films aren't meant to be confusing but for much of the running time I was completely mystified as to whom the gang was actually talking about. "Where's Clair?" one girl asks repeatedly. Which one was Clair, was the question I wanted answered? \r\n</p><p>\r\nDespite all these things I couldn't help but like Black Christmas just a little bit. Perhaps it is because the film absolutely refuses to ever get into the Christmas spirit. Practically every character is mean, bitchy or just plain homicidal. It's a very dark film considering it is set during the season of goodwill. The killers, for instance, (the film has two) have a penchant for eyes and everyone who dies seems to be on the receiving end of a pen, icicle, thumb or ornamental unicorn through the cornea and although the novelty does begin to wear off, the setting never does. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter an hour into the film you wonder how it is that any of the girls manage to find the space to wander off alone inside the festively decorated sorority house? It already has two serial killers, five other girls and four corpses all hanging around inside it. Still the appearance of the second villain is nicely handled, although I would have enjoyed a show down between Billy and his progeny since they clearly had issues with each other. \r\n</p><p>\r\nBlack Christmas is perhaps the seasonally equivalent of that pair of socks you get every year. It's pretty hard to get excited over it, but the film's familiarity is comforting in its own way. \r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	399	2011-03-26
400	1	20	\N	Monster House	<p>\r\nIn a quiet suburban town lives a cantankerous old man named Nebbercracker (voice by Steve Buscemi - The Island) who terrorises any child who steps a foot on so much as one blade of grass in his precious front garden. Any child who crosses the line runs the risk of losing a toy, a bike, anything that Nebbercracker gets his hands on.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAcross the street lives skinny dweeb DJ (voice by Mitchel Musson - Secondhand Lions), our hero, who has been observing the erratic raving old man through his telescope, cataloguing each child's terrible encounter with the loon. Then one day his friend Chowder's (voice by Sam Lerner - Envy) basketball bounces into the old man's garden and DJ reluctantly steps forward to retrieve the ball. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWithin seconds Nebbercracker is on the loose and is waving the terrified DJ in the air while he rants about the terrible fate of anyone who touches his garden. The strain of this encounter is too much for Nebbercracker and he falls to the grass apparently dead while DJ fears he is responsible for the old man's passing. But worse is yet to come for our young hero.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSoon after the loss of Nebbercracker, the old man's house starts to behave strangely. It abducts a stray dog that wet its lawn, it even attacks two police officers who respond to DJ's calls for help. The house is alive and it's a monster (hence the title).\r\n</p><p>\r\nWith only his friend Chowder and a smart girl from school named Jenny (voice by Spencer Locke - Spanglish) for help, DJ and his new team decide to enter the house and stop the evil spirit that has possessed it. However when they get inside they learn a dark truth about the house's past and its evil intent. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIf this sounds quite dark and terrifying for a children's movie, please relax. This latest animated movie keeps the dark content light by including lots of physical comedy from an array of well presented characters. The effects are fantastic and the action is exciting, and being that this is actually a semi-horror story it manages to stand apart from other recent animations such as <i>Hoodwinked</i> and <i>Open Season</i>.\r\n</p><p>\r\nLending vocal talent to this movie is Jason Lee (Clerks 2) as a stoner, Jon Heder (Heaven Can Wait) as the all knowing pizza guy and Maggie Gyllenhaal (Trust the Man) as a rock chick babysitter.  We also get to meet Kevin James (Hitch) as a disbelieving cop, and Catherine O'Hara (Over the Hedge) and Fred Willard (Date Movie) as DJ's preoccupied parents.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFun, exciting, spooky and original, this is a nice animated movie that stands apart from other fun creature features. Recommended for fans of 'The Corpse Bride', 'Shrek' and 'The Goonies'.\r\n</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	400	2011-03-26
402	1	20	\N	Big Nothing	<p>\r\nIn a sleepy remote town a former scientist, Charlie (David Schwimmer - Madagascar), spends his days working on ways to help support his young family. His wife Penelope is a tough detective who is hot on the heels of a psychopath and living in her shadow Charlie feels a little overlooked.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFinding work at a computer call centre, Charlie realises he has to do something radical to kick start a failing career. After a hilarious faux pas and being fired, in a moment of weakness and susceptibility Charlie falls in with new colleague Gus (Simon Pegg - Mission Impossible 3) who has a con planned to make some quick cash.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWith a list of local customers who regularly visit porn websites, Gus hopes to blackmail those citizens whose lives could be devastated if the truth be known. As a first step Gus hopes to blackmail a local reverend and he needs Charlie to provide an alibi. Just as Gus explains his daring plan, they are joined by a manipulative teen beauty queen Josie (Alice Eve - Starter for Ten) who overheard the scam and wants her cut.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFeeling things cannot get worse and with a desire to help his family, Charlie agrees and at the beginning everything seems to be going well. The blackmail call is made by Josie and Gus goes to collect the dough while Charlie provides an alibi at the local bar. It's at that moment when things start to unravel. Charlie realises the alibi is flawed and he must rush to stop Gus before things get out of hand.\r\n</p><p>\r\nCharlie creeps into the reverend's home looking for Gus and instead finds the dodgy vicar dead on the floor. With no sign of Gus, Charlie decides to hide the body. At that point Gus emerges from a toilet and informs Charlie that he has knocked the reverend out.  Charlie realises the enormity of his error and the trouble they are now in. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAs they seek a solution they stumble upon the deceased's dubious video collection that includes several snuff films. At this delicate stage an eager police man arrives to talk with the reverend and Charlie has to try and distract the cop. Just as that potential disaster is avoided, the reverend's angry wife arrives demanding the bag of loot so she can run off with her lover. Charlie and Gus are held at gun point with the unconscious cop on the floor.  Suddenly Josie arrives and dispatches the wife with axe. \r\n</p><p>\r\nBelieve it or not, that is only the beginning of the numerous mishaps and twists that befall the three leads in a constantly changing screwball crime comedy. Set in remote America, but filmed in the UK and the Isle of Man, Big Nothing is one of those fun smaller films that rarely gets the attention they deserve. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDavid Schwimmer is normally quite annoying and finds it hard to shed the 'Ross' image he established in Friends. I'm not going say he completely shifts that stereotype in this movie but he at least offers a bit of variety in a stronger grittier role. Meanwhile our very own Simon Pegg has another great big screen performance and even manages a half convincing American accent throughout. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIn support a variety of stars crop up to deliver small but interesting roles including Natascha McElhone (Ronin) as Charlie's wife Penelope, Jon Polito (Bog Lebowski) as an FBI detective and Mimi Rogers (Lost in Space) as the reverend's angry wife.\r\n</p><p>\r\nReminiscent of <i>'Shallow Grave'</i> and <i>'Very Bad Things'</i>, this is a tongue in cheek comedy crime thriller with plenty of twists and unexpected departures. The quickly changing storyline keeps the audience on their toes but after a while it gets a bit tiring and the gags start to get a bit thin. Luckily the movie doesn't stretch too far and ends well. For new director Jean-Baptiste Andrea this was a great first step into mainstream cinema and more than good enough to ensure bigger and better things to come. \r\n</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	402	2011-03-26
403	1	15	\N	Deja Vu	<p>\r\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms isn't quite as glamorous as the usual law enforcement agencies that onscreen American heroes tend to work for. Still they must be a fairly important bunch since when ATF agent Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington - Man On Fire), turns up at the scene of a major terrorist bombing in New Orleans he has everyone running around after him as he conjures up theories and evidence out of thin air. In fact he is so good he works out vital information about the bomb before other agents have even hung up their coats and then discovers that one dead burn victim pulled from the river was dumped into the water hours before the bombing even took place. \r\n</p><p>\r\nFBI agent Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer - Heat) is so impressed he invites Carlin to join his revolutionary surveillance unit to try and track down the killer. The satellite footage they have is amazing, it covers all of New Orleans and can even see through walls but it takes about four days to process the footage so the team can't look at the explosion itself for several days. \r\n</p><p>\r\nCarlin instead decides to focus on the victim who was murdered early, a rather attractive young lady called Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton). Finally Carlin twigs that this 'satellite' is too good to be true and the geeks running the system reluctantly admit that they have opened a window that sees four days into the past. \r\n</p><p>\r\nCarlin decides instead of trying to simply learn the identity of the bomber, they should try and thwart the attack itself. For twenty minutes Dj vu is a genuinely interesting thriller, with super-agent Washington making meaningful assumptions and uncovering nefarious plot twists,.  Suddenly Val Kilmer turns up, presumably from the catering van judging by his girth, the sci-fi nonsense starts and the film's credibility plummets. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDirector Tony Scott is one of Hollywood's best action directors; just witness his expert handling of the bombing of the ferry at the start of Dj vu, but the plot leaves our hero sitting in front of a bank of monitors watching his (dead) love interest wander around her house for ages instead of engaging in shoot outs and stunts. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhen a car chase does eventually kick off, Denzel has driven around while wearing a silly sci-fi helmet because he is following a car in a different time frame! Frankly it's all faintly ludicrous and you just wish they would get round to sending someone back in time to save the day. \r\n</p><p>\r\nMarty McFly ended up in 1955 within ten minutes of the start of Back to the Future. It takes Doug Carlin about an hour and half just to go back four days. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDj vu isn't actually that bad. It has a dependably excellent leading man, a likable love interest and a creepy villain (Jim Caviezel - The Passion of the Christ). Tony Scott's direction is slick as always, but at no point could I suspend my disbelief and actually accept the film's time travel premise. If you don't worry about such things and are easily entertained then this doesn't really matter but I sat there thinking about how a decent premise could go so strangely off the rails.\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	403	2011-03-26
404	1	20	\N	Apocalypto	<p>\r\nYoung Jaguar Paw spends his days hunting for food with his father and friends in the jungles of South America. He is a Mayan tribesman with a loving wife and young son who stay at home while he hunts for food and plays pranks on his large friend. \r\n</p><p>\r\nLife is simple and rewarding; days spent hunting the tapir and evenings dancing with his wife by the camp fire. But one day while in the jungle Jaguar Paw witnesses the migration of a neighbouring tribe who are seeking a new home. When he asks them why they left their camp, they only answer that their land was 'ravaged'. \r\n</p><p>\r\nUnsettled by fears of an unknown doom, Jaguar Paw wakes early the next day and feels uneasy in his idyllic home for a good reason. On the outskirts of his camp a slaver from the Mayan capital and his band of soldiers are slowly preparing to storm the town. Within minutes the sleeping community is overrun by powerful warriors who beat and tie the men and women down while burning the houses and killing anyone who becomes too problematic. \r\n</p><p>\r\nJaguar Paw manages to steal his family away and hide them in a hidden well but he is spotted and dragged off to join his tribesmen, enslaved, and marched off to the capital as an offering to the gods for deliverance from a famine. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAs Jaguar Paw seeks an escape from his captivity, his young wife and son realise they are trapped in the well. Time is against both husband and wife. After being spared death on a sacrificial alter, Jaguar Paw manages to kill one of his captors and flee back to the jungle. The slaver, witnessing the death of his son at the hands of Jaguar Paw, leads his warriors into the forest to track down and kill the young man. The race is on.\r\n</p><p>\r\nApocalypto is a film unlike any we have seen for some time. At its core it is a chase movie where the characters are on foot with no technology or effects, just raw action and an extreme environment. Overlaying the linear story of a manhunt, we get a detailed glimpse at the lost Mayan world, rarely explored in film. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe history of South America wasn't really part of my education so I can't comment on the authenticity of the film's content but visually the film was very impressive and the fast pace meant that the movie never seemed to drag despite its two hour plus running time.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFilmed entirely in a lost language, many popcorn fans may fear the subtitles but as the dialogue frequently gives way to long action sequences the words are not a problem and often contain the film's numerous jokes.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOn the acting front, the majority of the cast are unknowns speaking an unfamiliar language so it's difficult to comment on their performances. In the lead role of Jaguar Paw, Rudy Youngblood gives an energetic and frantic performance as he spends most of the film being chased through unrelenting jungle with little hope of escape. Similarly the chap who plays the slaver (cannot recall his character name) was very imposing and you got the distinct impression he probably could rip you limb from limb if he wanted. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDirector Mel Gibson (The Passion of Christ) is still recovering from the backlash following his anti-Semitic comments and regrettably this film is suffering for it. That is a sad state of affairs that may be healed in time but probably not soon enough to save this film's box office takings. The film is set entirely in South America, prior to the arrival of Europeans and their religions, but makes no strong comment on either Christianity or Judaism. Please give it a chance.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe film does contain quite a lot of graphic violence but thankfully the most bloodthirsty scenes of human sacrifice are viewed from a distance. The close quarter fighting is intense and frequent but is for the most part no more graphic or unsettling than anything seen in your average 'Final Destination' or 'Saw' movie.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFans of action movies who are brave enough to see a cultural film (well, it does have subtitles) should enjoy the relentless chase and the frequent fisticuffs. Fans of historical dramas such as <i>'The Mission'</i> and <i>'The Last of the Mohicans'</i>, and anyone who can remember the eco-warrior movie <i>'The Emerald Forest'</i>, should enjoy this movie. \r\n</p><p>\r\nOverall this was a visual treat and a great chase movie. Some may have hoped for more exploration of the Mayan world and maybe less violence but then again some may want to watch this film just for the chase. On balance I think this is a good film and more entertaining than you may initially think, three stars, go see it.\r\n</p><p>\r\n</p><p>\r\n**** Scroll down for a minor rant ****\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell educated and respected critics will not view the film because of Mel Gibson's recent anti-Semitic comments, and audiences who respect these critics may avoid the film. \r\n</p><p>\r\nI can sympathise with people taking offence at Mel Gibson for his comments, they are unforgivable, but at the same time I wonder how intelligent people can be so naive as to taint the work of hundreds of cast and crew because of their objections to one man. \r\n</p><p>\r\nTrue, the director's name gets pride of place on the poster and suggests that the film is entirely due to his efforts but anyone with two brain cells knows that any film is the culmination of the creative input of countless writers, producers, actors, historical consultants, costume designers, location scouts, musical composers, special effects, choreographers, runners, gaffers, stunt men, sound technicians, caterers and an army of other people who all contribute to the film. Wake up and stop judging the work of an artistic army based purely on your feelings against one man and actually watch the film.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	3	2011-03-26	404	2011-03-26
405	1	20	\N	Night at the Museum	<p>Larry (Ben Stiller - Madagascar) is a dreamer who believes he will one day start a new and successful business that will make him his fortune. He is separated from his wife and the highlight of his life is the time he gets to spend with his son Nick (Jake Cherry - Friends with Money). \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhat with all the apartment moves and job changes inherent with being a drifter, Larry has to shape up or he will lose the respect of his son forever. To try and make things more stable Larry takes a job as the new night watchman at New York's Museum of Natural History.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter a quick tour of the museum with his slightly crazy predecessor Cecil (Dick Van Dyke - Curious George), Larry is left alone to watch over the enormous museum. After a brief snooze Larry decides to visit the toilet but on his way notices something amiss. The large stone pedestal that supported the T-Rex skeleton is empty; the T-Rex is alive.\r\n</p><p>\r\nRunning through the corridors fearing for his life Larry learns that the dinosaurs are not the only things alive. Everything is alive. Even the huge stone head dragged from Easter Island. Thankfully Cecil has left some handy instructions to help Larry regain some control and a wax work of Teddy Roosevelt (Robin Williams - Happy Feet) helps him calm the chaos.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter some reluctance Larry accepts the job and to help him keep control of the exhibits he swots up on his history. Soon he is getting confident enough that he enjoys his work but a sinister plan is brewing and on the one night he takes his son to the museum, things go awry when someone steals the source of the magic that brings the exhibits to life.\r\n</p><p>\r\nNight At The Museum has been advertised for a long time in advance of its release and some people may worry that this may indicate a poor film. Happily, this movie was really great fun and I'd recommend it to kids of all ages.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBen Stiller is on top form as the ambitious dad swept up in the magic. He combines his characteristic energetic anger with some great physical comedy. My favorite moment is when he consoles an emotionally neglected Attila the Hun. Meanwhile, the supporting cast includes Robin Williams as the courageous but shy president Roosevelt who inspires leadership in Larry while trying to pluck up the courage to talk to his love, the wax mannequin of Sacajawea. Other notable cameos include Owen Wilson (You, Me & Dupree) as a miniature cowboy figurine, Steve Coogan (Marie Antoinette) as his Roman figurine rival Octavius, and Ricky Gervais (The Office [TV]) as the anal retentive museum director. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAdding clout to the already impressive cast, screen legends Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney and Bill Cobbs as the three aged security guards who are reluctantly being laid off to be replaced by Larry. I would list some of the movies these three gents have starred in but they have been in literally hundreds.\r\n</p><p>\r\nNight at the Museum is great fun with action, comedy, minor peril and some fantastic effects. Fans of <i>Jumanji</i> and <i>Zathura</i> will like this film. \r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	405	2011-03-26
408	1	15	\N	Perfume - The Story of a Murder	<p>\r\nJean-Baptiste Grenouille is born into a pile of filth and fish guts and left to die by his pitiless mother. Raised in an orphanage and then sold to a tannery, Grenouille quickly discovers he possesses an extraordinary sense of smell that allows him to identify anything in the world, even over great distances, simply by its scent. \r\n</p><p>\r\nA brief encounter with an intoxicating fruit seller in the streets of Paris leads Grenouille to a gruesome discovery. After accidentally suffocating the terrified young woman, the killer realises the girl's beautiful smell quickly fades from her corpse and is lost forever. Grenouille resolves never to allow such an extraordinary smell to be entrusted to something so fragile and fleeting as life. \r\n</p><p>\r\nTaken on as an apprentice to an old Italian perfumer (Dustin Hoffman - Marathon Man) who exploits his amazing talent, Grenouille attempts to discover the secret to preserving a person's smell, even the process doesn't include preserving that person's life. \r\n</p><p>\r\nClearly time and effort has been lavishly spent on this European-funded film project based on Patrick Suskind's best-selling novel. Any plot that relies so significantly on smell, a sense that is beyond film's ability to transmit, would likely be a disaster, but triumphantly the filmmakers have used vivid colour and sound to convey a huge variety of pungent smells to the audience. \r\n</p><p>\r\nUnfortunately while the cinematography is memorable, the performances are wayward. Our spindly protagonist (Ben Whishaw - Layer Cake) is reminiscent of Gollum and Dustin Hoffman is clearly unsure of what type of picture he is appearing in, pitching his performance towards comedy complete with comedy accent. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhile the scenes in Paris, which track Grenouille's rise from squalor to the most valuable assistant of a fading perfumer, are intriguing. When he arrives in the town of Grasse the character slips into the shadows and becomes, while not your everyday serial killer, at least a more recognisable and less interesting villain. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe focus of the film switches to the daughter of a local nobleman whom Grenouille identifies with his first accidental victim. His role for the next forty minutes is restricted to bumping unfortunate young ladies over the back of the head and spying on the vivacious Laura from alleyways. Rachel Hurd-Wood, who plays Laura, has proved herself to be a talented young actress in her previous roles in An American Haunting and Peter Pan, but here she is squeaky voiced and disappointing as the ultimate object of Grenouille's obsession. The film's other headline star, Alan Rickman (Die Hard), is underwritten as Laura's protective father and appears in only the second half of the film, just as it begins to wobble and lose credibility. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe final scenes, where Jean Baptiste must answer for his crimes, will leave the audience, no doubt already impatient with the film's running time, incredulous at the bizarre turn of events. \r\n</p><p>\r\nPerfume the novel had been previously described as unfilmable and on this evidence the nay sayers were correct. This isn't, however, a film that should be avoided at all costs. For pure curiosities sake it is quite an experience and although the finale may leave you scratching your head, or even laughing, you certainly won't see another film like it.\r\n</p>	2	2011-03-26	408	2011-03-26
409	1	20	\N	Employee of the Month	<p>\r\nZack is a waster hiding from responsibility on the bottom rung of the supermarket career ladder. He rolls his way round the aisles as a box boy with few cares or ambitions and enjoying his frequent confrontations with Vince, the ideal employee and his nemesis, as well as playing cards with his friends.\r\n</p><p>\r\nVince is an arse kissing creep who has won employee of the month for so long that nobody can remember anyone else ever winning it. He is only one month away from breaking the employee of the month record and winning a brand new car. \r\n</p><p>\r\nInto this small world of bargain goods enters a new cashier, the beautiful Amy (Jessica Simpson - The Dukes of Hazzard). Zack is mesmerised and he quickly uses his underhand tactics to get a peek at her personnel file in the hope of finding any clue that may help him win her heart. Unfortunately the file suggests that Amy, wonderful Amy, has a thing for employees of the month. \r\n</p><p>\r\nZack is doubly upset by this revelation as not only has Vince seduced and bedded many a female employee/customer that Zack has fancied, but it means he'll have to win employee of the month himself if he is to impress Amy and save her from Vince. That means more than work; it means a complete change in lifestyle.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMeanwhile Vince has also spotted the wonderful Amy and has plans of his own. He soon learns that Amy has a thing for employees of the month and starts making his move, partly to satisfy his own lust but also to annoy desperate to impress Zack. The last thing Vince expects though is for Zack to start working wonders around the store and stealing the sacred daily gold stars that are used to identify employee of the month,\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe battle is on and each employee fights dirty to get the gold stars and the converted Amy. Vince is assisted by his loyal slave Jorge (Efren Ramirez - Napoleon Dynamite) who starts to feel abused while Zack is assisted by his friends including a blind optician (Andy Dick - Hoodwinked) and an electrical goods rep (Brian George - Cars).\r\n</p><p>\r\nOther than Jessica Simpson, herself fairly new to the big screen, this film is full of relative unknowns but they were all great in their respective roles. As the lead character Zack, Dane Cook (Stuck on You) carried the show well and had some well timed moments of comedy brilliance. However, the movie was dominated by the over the top shameless antics of Dax Shepherd (Without a Paddle) as Vince; ruthless in his pursuit for status and victory over wannabe contender Zack. \r\n</p><p>\r\nHighly recommended for fans of <i>Dodgeball</i>, <i>The 40-year-old Virgin</i>, <i>Anchorman</i> and <i>Talladega Nights</i>, this is a fun comedy with moments of great physical and situational comedy.\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	409	2011-03-26
410	1	15	\N	Smokin Aces	<p>\r\nPart time illusionist and mid-level mobster Buddy Israel (Jeremy Piven) has skipped bail and is on the run. Hiding out in the penthouse suite of a glitzy hotel and casino, Buddy is waiting with his heavily armed protection for his lawyer to secure him a clemency deal with the FBI in return for testifying against a powerful gangster. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe criminal underworld isn't willing to let Israel go without a fight however and a $1 million bounty to deliver Buddy's heart to the mob has been offered. That kind of money has drawn half a dozen rival killers to his hotel, all itching to get at the snitch, while two FBI agents are hot on Israel's heels as well. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSmokin Aces so desperately wants to be cool it's almost embarrassing. With its flashy camera work, ultra violence and snappy script its makers think it's the next Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs or Snatch. It isn't. In fact it doesn't even compare well with Bad Boys II. \r\n</p><p>\r\nFor a supposedly quick draw gunfight flick, the pace is ponderous. The Feds spend fifteen minutes at the start listing the dozen or so groups mixed up in the mess without revealing anything interesting about them at all, and at one stage it takes about twenty minutes (when including cutting to action elsewhere) for two characters to complete a single elevator journey. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWith so many well-armed adversaries all heading for the same place you should expect nothing less than an all guns blazing action finale where the cast are dropped like flies. It's practically the selling point of the entire film but the confrontation never materialises. \r\n</p><p>\r\nInstead two medium gun battles mark the end of the action in the hotel with plenty of the main cast alive and well. Every word of dialogue is spat out at high speed with characters constantly explaining to each other the state of play as it stands. Unfortunately the dialogue is also difficult to understand thanks to a poor sound mix and when you do catch what people are saying it isn't terribly interesting anyway. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe film has managed to attract a big cast of high calibre stars including genre regulars like Ray Liotta (Goodfellas), who was presumably experienced enough in this sort of thing to realise he was appearing in a dud so decided not to bother. Ryan Reynolds (Just Friends), who plays Liotta's FBI Agent partner, seems to be under the illusion that he is in a much higher calibre action flick, perhaps one actually made by Quentin Tarantino, so he tries a heck of a lot harder. Andy Garcia simply looks like he has wandered in from the Ocean's 11 set still in character. Alicia Keys is fine in her first major film role as one half of a female assassin team and Ben Affleck's participation in the proceedings is mercifully short. \r\n</p><p>\r\nJeremy Piven is perhaps the film's biggest disappointment considering his fine television work in Entourage. The role of larger than life Buddy Israel seems tailormade for him but perhaps that's the problem since Israel is simply the loud, brash, bullying Ari Gold from Entourage but with all his charm and wit removed. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIt is not hard to understand why the studio dropped this limp action flick into the cinematic wasteland of January, a bleak landscape where only Oscar contenders usually venture out. Even dodgy twists can't redeem it and I for one would have pulled the plug on this dross far earlier. \r\n</p>	1	2011-03-26	410	2011-03-26
415	1	20	\N	The Fountain	<p>\r\nAfter a six year absence the brilliant, if bizarre, Darren Aronofsky returns with another imaginative and daring piece of cinema. In 1998 Aronofsky shot to fame with the excellent and dark masterpiece <i>'Pi'</i>, followed by the cult but distressing <i>'Requiem for a Dream'</i>. Now Aronofsky returns with a three prong story exploring the feelings of loss and ambition centering on a quest for immortality.\r\n</p><p>\r\nDr Tom Creo (Hugh Jackman - The Prestige) is a medical research scientist desperately trying to find a cure for cancer so that he may save the life of his ailing wife Izzi (Rachel Weisz - The Constant Gardener). Izzi is a writer who has almost finished her latest book, The Fountain, and asks Tom to start reading it.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAs Tom reads the book we see the story played out. The Fountain tells the tale of a noble Conquistador Tomas (Hugh Jackman) in love with the besieged queen Isabel of Spain (Rachel Weisz) who sends her knight on a quest. A monk has returned from South America where he claims to have located the fabled Tree of Life hidden from mankind since the days of Genesis. The tree has the power to grant immortality and the queen, soon to be destroyed, needs that chance.\r\n</p><p>\r\nInterspersed between the story of Dr Tom Creo and his fictional persona Tomas, the Nobel knight, we see some really bizarre scenes of a bald meditative Tommy residing in a glass orb floating through space. Within the orb with Tommy is a dying tree, possibly the tree of life, and as Tommy tends to the ailing tree and talks to it lovingly, he is haunted by images from the past, images of Izzi.\r\n</p><p>\r\nI never managed to watch 'Requiem for a Dream'. I was probably dissuaded by a trusted critic's verdict that it was 'the best film he'll never watch again' which suggests that it was another masterpiece but perhaps as depressing as Deerhunter after drinking a bottle of Absinth. \r\n</p><p>\r\nI personally love thought provoking cinema when it has a good story that rewards the patient viewer and in this respect 'The Fountain' was fantastic. The story struck an emotional chord, the science fiction was well handled and the three tier story line worked well with the subject material. Visually stunning without resorting to CGI, this is a great piece of cinema but sadly one that may be missed by the majority.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFor the casual popcorn viewer lured in by thoughts of 'Highlander with Hugh Jackman', this movie may prove a bit too odd. The opening siege of a Mayan temple cuts sharply to a bald Jackman talking to a tree in space and these sudden leaps can be disorientating unless you are prepared to concentrate. Those with patience to see the film through to its end will be rewarded.\r\n</p><p>\r\nRachel Weisz is beautiful and tragic as the spiritual Izzi finishing her book, The Fountain, as her own life draws to a close. Although she appears in the film more as a ghost than a dramatic character she adds ethereal elegance to the dark emotional proceedings. As great as Weisz is, this movie centers upon the single central role of Tomas/Dr Tom/Tommy played by Hugh Jackman. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAll at once Jackman plays a fearless warrior, a heart broken scientist and a peaceful monk, all three trying to deal in their own way with the impending loss of their one true love. The three characters share a common problem but show different persona's, all three are reflections of one character, that of Dr Tom. Jackman does well to pull off a hat trick as each character is sufficiently independent as not to blur and yet similar enough that the parallels are not lost. I feel this is Jackman's finest performance to date and proves that he doesn't need magic tricks or metal claws to make an impact. Shame this film will receive only a small audience.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBefore visiting the cinema I quickly glanced at the ratings provided by other critics, awards split neatly into either two stars for mediocre madness or four for marvelous movie making, no middle ground at all. With such a split in opinion I was eager to see for myself. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe Fountain is both odd and highly emotional but it is also amazingly imaginative and well acted. This is a four star film for those who enjoy challenging science fiction. Sadly this movie, excellent as it is, may be a bit too much for a wider audience and so may make it as a cult classic rather than a box office smash.\r\n</p>	4	2011-03-26	415	2011-03-26
417	1	20	\N	Blood Diamond	<p>\r\nIn the 1990's, the small African nation of Sierra Leone stood on the brink of civil war. The poor nation was being torn apart from the inside. Blood Diamond tells the remarkable story of three people caught up in the search for a large pink diamond lost somewhere in the wild bush.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSolomon (Djimon Hounsou - Constantine) is a rural fisherman who hopes that his children will benefit from a good education and one day rise above their humble beginnings. One day as he walks back to his village with his son, his world comes undone. \r\n</p><p>\r\nRebel militia storms the town gunning down all in their path except those few men deemed strong enough to work as slaves in the diamond fields. Solomon manages to get his family to safety but he himself gets caught and dragged off to a mining camp.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAt the camp Solomon is put to work sifting river silt in search of diamonds. Any diamonds that are found are used by the merciless Captain Poison (David Harewood - The Merchant of Venice) to buy arms and fuel his rebellion. As Solomon filters the alluvial sludge he happens upon a miracle, a clear pink diamond as big as a walnut. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSolomon manages to bury the diamond in the undergrowth but not before Captain Poison has spotted it. Before Poison can catch Solomon, the government army arrives and both Solomon and Poison are transported back to a prison in Freetown.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMeanwhile on the border between Sierra Leone and Liberia, a destitute mercenary and smuggler named David Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio - The Departed) is trying to steal some diamonds across the border when he is caught and sent to a prison in Freetown.\r\n</p><p>\r\nArcher is a despicable person, hardly a loveable rogue. He is a self serving parasite feeding off the declining situation in Sierra Leone. From Rhodesia, Archer was a trained soldier of fortune who slipped into the black market and is heavily indebted to a fearsome Colonel who demands repayment.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn the prison at Freetown Solomon stands silent hoping for release when Captain Poison is wheeled in. Poison recognises Solomon and demands loudly to know where he buried the pink diamond. Solomon denies knowledge of the diamond but Poison barks louder promising to track down Solomon's family and make them suffer unless he delivers the stone. Poison shouts loud enough to rouse the attention of Archer who is also languishing in the prison pondering how he can buy his way out of hell.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWith his contacts and his small amount of influence, Archer gets out of prison and secures the release of Solomon. While Solomon tries in vain to find his family, Archer keeps heckling him and asking him to guide him to the stone. \r\n</p><p>\r\nUltimately the rebel militia arrives in Freetown and the city falls into violent anarchy. There is no longer any safety and Solomon knows he has little choice but to comply with Archer and find a safe route out of the city. Archer promises to help Solomon find his family in exchange for leading him to the stone.\r\n</p><p>\r\nTo help find Solomon's family, Archer reluctantly calls upon our third primary character, a relentless journalist Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly - Little Children). Maddy is intent on exposing the diamond trade's nasty secrets and the humanitarian disaster that surrounds it. She knows better than Solomon about how treacherous Archer really is but she knows the only hope of stopping the conflict is to draw in the West, and to do that she needs evidence of the West's complicity, evidence only Archer can provide.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe three characters are now joined together in the quest for the diamond and the hope it brings for each of them. All that stands in the way is a war torn country and countless people intent on either killing them or claiming the stone from themselves.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBlood Diamond has a strong story line, well explored characters, and very visceral action sequences that keep you on the edge of your seat. The film is as unrelenting as the conflict it portrays and despite being over two hours long the audience around me was gripped. The film successfully combines popular star actors and action with a more serious political message without becoming too heavy. \r\n</p><p>\r\nCovering similar ground to last year's well received 'The Constant Gardener', director Edward Zwick (The Last Samurai) has made a strong piece of cinema that will appeal to a wider audience without cashing in too heavily on a recent trend of African-based thrillers.\r\n</p><p>\r\nDjimon Hounsou is excellent as the everyday fisherman, Solomon, who has his life torn from him and who has to confront the increasingly violent truth around him and fight to get his family back. Often neglected Djimon has been nominated again for best supporting actor (was nominated for his role in 'In America') and hopefully this time he'll get the accolade. Similarly Leonardo is nominated for best actor in lead role for his portrayal of David Archer, a grittier character with more dialogue and a nasty edge. However I felt the accent slipped a few times and considering he was in nearly every scene he was almost outshone by Jennifer Connelly who had far less screen time. Despite this, Leonardo played a character against type and had some challenges and for that I feel he does deserve credit. Connelly, meanwhile, is as captivating as ever (but I may be biased) and adds a much needed element of humanity to the otherwise blood soaked storyline. \r\n</p><p>\r\nBlood Diamond attacks the senses and combines action with thought provoking material to make a sure fire blockbuster. Some moments are a bit clichd and often lines of exceptional dialogue feel somehow familiar but overall the film is great. For people who enjoyed <i>'The Constant Gardener'</i> but felt it a bit heavy or slow, this film will be of interest. At the same time fans of DiCaprio will not be disappointed. Finally, if you enjoy political thrillers and war filsm such as <I>'Last King of Scotland'</i>, <i>'Shooting Dogs'</i> or <i>'Hotel Rwanda'</i>, this film will be of interest.\r\n</p>	4	2011-03-26	417	2011-03-26
418	1	16	\N	Dreamgirls	<p>\r\nIn the latest Broadway musical adaptation, Dreamgirls tells the story of three women with a dream to become huge musical stars.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSet in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a singing trio called The Dreamettes take a stab at a talent contest in the hope of hitting the big time.  Lead singer Effie (Jennifer Hudson - American Idol fame [TV]) and her talented friends, Deena (Beyonce Knowles - The Pink Panther) and Lorrell (Anika Noni Rose - Surviving Christmas) are lucky enough to be picked from obscurity by wannabe record manager Curtis (Jamie Foxx - Miami Vice).\r\n</p><p>\r\nCurtis, a used car sales man, has high hopes for the girls and he manages to secure them a spot as back up singers for the legendary James Early (Eddie Murphy - Shrek 2).  Despite Effie's dislike for singing back up, the other girls convince her that it could be their big break.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe Dreamettes become really popular and Curtis realises that the trio have what it takes to go it alone.  He starts to promote the girls as their own act, The Dreams.  Along with the lyrical expertise of Effie's brother CC (Keith Robinson - Half & Half [TV]), The Dreams are a huge hit and the audience adores them.\r\n</p><p>\r\nHowever, the band's rise to fame starts to push Effie out as the lead with more focus on Deena as the real star of.  Curtis also turns his affections away from Effie towards Deena when he realises she has more of a pop appeal and look than Effie.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAs Curtis' hunger for more money and a new band image takes over, Effie is forced to leave and without her there the other girls are not strong enough to stand against Curtis. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAs we all know, the path of fame is never straightforward.  Drugs and dodgy money-making tactics soon start to break up the happy trio and James Early's career starts to slide as he gets hooked on coke.  Eventually the band's dream fades and each singer must choose their own path. Effie, forgotten by many, is coming back.\r\n</p><p>\r\nStar performances come from newcomer Hudson who has a spectacular voice and completely outshines Knowles with her strong and sassy personality.  Foxx is superb as the manipulative and aggressive record producer while Murphy is on top perform as the crazy James Early.  Knowles performs well as the beautiful love interest while Danny Glover (Barnyard) returns to the big screen after a lengthy absence and offers an old school character as James Early's schmoozy agent Marty.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe singing performances in the movie are certainly worthy of praise even if, on some occasions, the use of song could be considered slightly cheesy, for instance, when used amid an argument.\r\n</p><p>\r\nDreamgirls will appeal to fans of musical adaptations such as <i>Chicago</i> and <i>What's Love Got to Do with It</i>.\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	418	2011-03-26
629	1	16	\N	Saw V	<p>'Dare you see Saw?' demands the poster, apparently not advertising a new adventure playground but in fact a film that has been branded not only the most gruesome but also the most innovative horror of the Halloween season.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Unfortunately for the film, already burdened enough with expectation, it has been compared favourably to David Fincher's Seven. It isn't in the same league.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>First time writer/director James Wan has come up with a suitably diabolical premise, the Jigsaw killer has been abducting individuals who he believes deserve to be taught a lesson. Each is delivered into extremely unpleasant situations where they have to prove how much they want to live, often at a deadly price.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>One unfortunate victim is revealed to have recently attempted to commit suicide by slitting his wrists. The killer decides to test his resolve by leaving him naked in a room surrounded by thickets of razor wire. If he truly wishes to die all he has to do is sit still and wait to die of thirst but if he fancies a shot at life then he can head for the door. Needless to say death by a thousand cuts shortly follows.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Certainly the film is malicious in its intent but strangely not as gory as might have been expected. Much of the blood letting happens off camera and some victims are spared before the most hideous deaths are dealt.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Much of the film is told from the perspective of the Jigsaw killers' latest victims, surgeon Lawrence (Cary Elwes - The Princess Brides) and photographer Adam (newcomer Leigh Whannell). Lawrence must kill Adam by six o' clock or his wife and child will meet a grisly end. The only problem is that to reach Adam, or even attempt escape, Lawrence will have to cut off his chained foot with a rusty looking hacksaw.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Also along for the ride is Danny Glover as the lead detective on the case who cunningly works out the villain's hide out only an hour into the film. His character comes up with a wonderfully novel reason why only him and his partner should raid the building in the dead of night ("Ah, the darkness will allow the two of us to sneak up on him!"). As soon as I noticed that Danny's partner wasn't Mel Gibson I feared for his long-term health.</p> \r\n \r\n<p>The film can rightly claim it is filled with suitably sick ideas but it isn't going to revolutionise the horror genre simply because the audience was spending too much time laughing at the movies' expense which hardly raised the tension as the clock wound down. Only one sequence was suitably nerve wracking, as Adam investigates his pitch black apartment with nothing but the flash bulb on his camera.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Likewise, a lot of time and thought has clearly gone into constructing a suitably unsettling ending but like everything else in the film, it doesn't hold up when compared to other similar films, especially a certain well thought of example that featured Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and a cardboard box.</p>	1	2011-03-26	629	2011-03-26
9	1	16	Blah	Jersey Girl	<p>Oliver Trinke (Ben Affleck - Daredevil) is a high flying PR executive for the music business who doesn't have much time for family life. After his wife Gertrude's (J-Lo - Out of Sight) sudden death, Oliver is suddenly thrown into single fatherhood. Can he juggle a successful time consuming career while raising his newborn daughter?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After an embarrassing fracas at work, Oliver loses his job and reluctantly moves away from the hectic city life he loved back to his more realistic hometown in New Jersey where he lives with his dad (George Carlin - Dogma). After a shaky start, Oliver soon faces up to his new responsibilities as a father. However, as young Gertie grows up the task of raising a kid doesn't get any easier. Oliver has been single now for seven years and in an embarrassing shopping confrontation, he meets an inquisitive and attractive student, Maya (Liv Tyler - LOTR). Meanwhile Gertie needs her dad to perform a show tune with her to the rest of the school, but preferably not 'Cats'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jersey girl follows the trials, rewards, pain and joy of single parenthood in a relatively light and engaging movie. The script shows the same originality and humour that was present in Director Kevin Smith's earlier films, Chasing Amy and Dogma combined with a more formulaic story thread allowing Smith an opportunity to show his directing skills. The story is not necessarily that original but the combination of the solid story and a good script helps raise this film above other similar kitchen sink dramas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the bad press surrounding Affleck and J-Lo's last film, Gigli, Jersey Girl really kept me gripped with a great comical yet touching performance by both Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler. George Carlin provided a lighter side to the story as the grumpy wise cracking dad while Raquel Castro as young Gertie played her part well as a maturing young girl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jersey Girl is a heartfelt and extremely emotional family flick with a subtle but balanced number of good jokes here and there to lighten the mood. Make sure you take your tissues.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	9	2012-03-08
413	1	15	Blah	Rocky Balboa	<p>The heavyweight boxing division is in trouble. The reigning champ Mason 'The Line' Dixon is aloof, unpopular and has no genuine challengers to face. Ageing two-time champ Rocky Balboa meanwhile is spending his retirement moping around Philadelphia after the death of his beloved wife Adrian.</p>\r\n<p>Hoping to regain a link to his past Balboa applies for a fighting licence just as a televised computer simulation suggests he would have beaten Dixon in his prime. Promoters are interested and the public is fascinated so a special exhibition fight is arranged in Las Vegas between the champ and the old warhorse. Will Rocky rise to the challenge or will the young blood finish him inside two rounds?</p>\r\n<p>If you don't know the answer you have clearly never seen a Rocky film in your life. Sylvester Stallone has been practically retired from the film business since 2003. His last appearance was in the flop Spy Kids 3D and he has had trouble finding good roles as far back as Copland. Stallone, however, clearly believes he still has something to offer the film-going public so he has dusted down his most famous creation for one final shot at the title.</p>\r\n<p>Stallone is responsible for both the direction and the script and Rocky Balboa is better than any sixth entry into a series has any right to be. Stallone even manages to look the part when he steps into the ring. Unfortunately the pace of the film is far too slow. Rocky wanders the streets of run down Philadelphia visiting his old haunts from days gone by and regales strangers in his restaurant with stories from the glory days. Fans of the series are no doubt happy to wallow in nostalgia with their hero, but not for a whole hour. The best word to describe these proceedings is dreary but Rocky was always an underdog who needed to be laid low before he got the chance to rise up again.</p>\r\n<p>What this film sorely needed was a proper rendition of the theme tune and a stirring montage sequence. Thankfully both arrive just in time. While Stallone's portrayal of an aging Rocky is affectionate and endearing, most of the supporting characters fail to live up to top billing.</p>\r\n<p>Rocky starts up a tentative friendship with Marie (Geraldine Hughes), a girl from the old neighbourhood, but she is too much hard work to be likable. The introduction of her son as a companion for Rocky is quickly abandoned when Rocky returns to the ring and this wasted time could have been better spent further exploring Rocky's strained relationship with his own son.</p>\r\n<p>Antonio Tarver portrays Mason Dixon as a nicely conflicted sportsman whose arrogance makes him deserving of a pummelling but he never inherits the same iconic status of Rocky's other opponents, Clubber Lang, Apollo Creed and Ivan Drago. The big fight scene provides Rocky with a fitting send off from the ring but with the character charting almost no new ground perhaps this opportunity should be taken to allow the people's champ to retire gracefully.</p>	2	2011-03-26	413	2012-03-08
364	1	20	Blah	The Departed	<p>Director Martin Scorsese is riding a high after the successful movies 'The Aviator' and 'Gangs of New York' and he has followed these movies with a remake of the recent Hong Kong thriller 'Infernal Affairs' (2002).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Relocated to Boston, the story focuses on two young recruits to the police force. Colin (Matt Damon - The Bourne Supremacy) is one of the two recruits who is secretly a mob insider hoping to work his way into the special investigation unit. Meanwhile Billy (Leonardo Di Caprio - The Aviator) is an excellent rookie who is commissioned to work undercover within the Irish mob headed by vicious boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson - Something's Gotta Give).</p>\r\n<p>After working for years to establish their new identities, each spy learns of the other's existence during a bungled raid on an arms technology deal. The race is on for each spy to find their opposite first because he who finds the mole first may survive.</p>\r\n<p>Breaking from the normal format for a review we have decided to discuss the movie's pro's and con's. The following is a short conversation between myself, Richard (R), and our oriental film expert Lal (L). Please be warned there may be hints to spoilers in our dialogue.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<p>Please Scroll Down</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p><B>L:</B> So, you already know my opinion about remakes of Asian films. What's your take?\r\n\r\n<p><B>R:</B> Remakes can work when they are justified. Not sure this one was though\r\n\r\n<p><B>L:</B> You're being remarkably restrained. I thought it was awful.\r\n\r\n<p><B>R:</B> Give me a moment, I am supressing rage. Shall I continue?\r\n\r\n<p><B>L:</B> We should qualify our opinions. Please do continue.\r\n\r\n<p><B>R:</B> Remakes of foreign films where the culture may be too drastically different can be forgiven. This can't. Hong Kong mob, Boston mob, still a mob\r\n\r\n<p><B>L:</B> That is all very true. I love Asian films but they can be a little daunting for those unfamiliar with the culture, or alternatively those too lazy to read sub-titles.\r\n\r\n<p><B>R:</B> Like Americans you mean.\r\n\r\n<p><B>L:</B> I didn't say that.  \r\n\r\n<p><B>R:</B> I did.\r\n\r\n<p><B>L:</B> To be fair, we both know English people who hate sub-titles. Ahem.\r\n\r\n<p><B>R:</B> Indeed.\r\n\r\n<p><B>L:</B> However, the main point about a remake is that it should be as good as the original, Well, as good as it can be given that it is no longer quite so original. This film failed in that respect quite spectacularly.\r\n\r\n<p><B>R:</B> Or!!! If you're gonna remake something that is fairly recent you should try to do something new with it. For instance, make a new cultural parallel or introduce a new angle, NOT introduce superfluous characters to an already crowded story weakening the already poorly sketched leads.\r\n\r\n<p><B>R:</B> I would like to apologise for my sweeping attack on America. I know many intelligent American's, sadly none of them have control of the dip shits who control the movie studios.\r\n\r\n<p><B>L:</B> Very true. The original film explored such themes as loyalty and identity, in particular, the identity of our conflicted undercover policeman (Leonardo Di Caprio). Why not make it a Philip K. Dick-esque SF film? \r\n\r\n<p><B>R:</B> Philip K. Dick,! Whoops they did, they called it 'A Scanner Darkly'.\r\n\r\n<p><B>L:</B> Damn you for showing up the fact that I have neither read the book nor seen the film.\r\n\r\n<p><B>R:</B> Quick salute to an exemplary American, Richard Linklater, someone brave enough to challenge the norms.\r\n\r\n<p><B>L:</B> Must resist opportunity to slag off America. Okay, what works about the film? Jack Nicholson was quite effective I thought (for 'effective' read restrained) as the mob boss guy whose name I have already forgotten. \r\n\r\n<p><B>R:</B> Indeed, I also think that Leonardo Di Caprio was quite good in the role of the undercover cop. Shame he wasn't given enough character development to connect with the audience.\r\n\r\n<p><B>L:</B> A good actor can only do so much with a bad script. I think you were asking the question about whether the film works on its own, without having to be compared with the original film.\r\n\r\n<p><B>R:</B> Yeah, there were problems. One particular weakness was the women, they introduced a few new characters (all men) and removed a few women leaving only one, a doctor. The problem was the shrink was meant to act as a moral centre to highlight the stain of the other characters. In this film she is a two timing grizzling therapist who looks like she needs counselling herself.\r\n\r\n<p><B>L:</B> There was no real sense of the emotional struggle that Billy was going through working undercover with hardened criminals. He wanted out because it was destroying him as a person, but all of that comes across as childish tantrums in his meetings with his bosses and with the psychiatrist.\r\n<p><B>R:</B> Yeah, that's true. Also the undercover crook, (Matt Damon), was reinvented as a self serving git rather than a criminal who begins to doubt his chosen path and tries to find redemption. Basically they buggered around with the characters and as a consequence ruined an original idea. Sounds a bit like American foreign policy to me.\r\n\r\n<p><B>L:</B> Please don't mention any country in the Axis of Evil please. Another problem was the ending. Well, not to give too much away, the ending of the original was quite a shock - downbeat, yet realistic. This film has about three endings (bloody Lord of the Rings) and it just gets progressively more ridiculous. \r\n\r\n<p><B>R:</B> Apologies again for straying from the point, I don't doubt America's diplomatic efforts have for the most part helped maintain peace around the world. I guess I am just confused in these dark days, and the media leaves me wondering who I should trust. Maybe that's why this film has appeal, a film about picking loyalties through a confused mess of lies. \r\n\r\n<p><B>L:</B> Enough of the bashing. Was there anything good about the film? I thought the direction was quite sharp, though I'm not entirely sure what the point of those strange transitions were (you know, where we could see a small circular portion of the screen and then it expanded outwards).\r\n\r\n<p><B>R:</B> Not sure either, the direction was ok but had some hokey moments like the rat on the fence and the terrible telephone calls interrupting the musical score. Anyway, good points, Nicholson and Sheen (Martin Sheen - Catch Me If You Can). Also they did manage to keep quite a bit of tension in crucial scenes that could otherwise have failed. \r\n\r\n<p><B>L:</B> True, though to be fair those scenes were copied from the original. I think one of the failings is that one feels little sympathy for the crooked cop. He's been put into a situation where he has to regularly betray his colleagues, and there's no sense of conflict within him. He's doing what he is doing because he is ordered to do so by Frank (Jack Nicholson?), and because it is beneficial to him. Whoops, I've just realised that I have returned to being critical of the film. Sorry.\r\n\r\n<p><B>R:</B> It's quite a tricky thing to try to get across. These two guys are essentially the same but on opposite sides of the fence. It is a good chance to compare the conflicts affecting each. Reminiscent of Michael Mann's 'Heat' but sadly the characters didn't really connect. Again I think most of our criticism here is aimed at the script. \r\n\r\n<p><B>L:</B> I suppose the problem facing the makers of the film is that the original was made so recently that things had to be changed. When faced with the prospect of changing a lean script, the only thing that can be done is to add to it. The added material seems to have been partly borrowed from the Infernal Affairs sequels, the scenes with Frank's wife, the addition of Mr French as Frank's brutal deputy, the extended introduction. It's all a bit too much. At two and a half hours, the film is long and it feels it. Scriptwriter William Monaghan was responsible for last year's <i>'Kingdom Of Heaven'</i>, and it's surprising that the man responsible for one excellent film can turn out this turgid piece of rubbish.\r\n\r\n<p><B>R:</B> There must be something good to say. Other critics, respectable well known critics, have awarded this film 4 or even 5 stars! What are we not seeing? I think maybe we are having difficulty looking at this film objectively as we are hooked on 'Infernal Affairs'. With an impartial eye I'd say the acting was good, the story, although weaker than the source, is still good and the filming itself for the most part is great. The script needed to be tighter and the twist needed a bit more tuning, some were good while some where comical.\r\n\r\n<p><B>L:</B> That scene where the police are trying to stop the deal between the Irish mob and the Chinese (who, strangely for mainland Chinese, were all speaking Cantonese not Mandarin) is silly, especially when Alec Baldwin loses it and decides to deck the tech guy. \r\n<p><B>R:</B> That was funny though, not intentionally. Maybe they wanted to get someone 'oriental' in to make a loose link with the original?\r\n\r\n<p><B>L:</B> I didn't recognise anyone from the original. As for that other point, I should know better than to continually put myself through this Asian film remake torture. \r\n\r\n<p><B>R:</B> True. Time to wrap this all up, I think this is an average gangster movie with a great cast that tried too hard to improve on a classic and sadly missed the target. Still worth watching but not a <I>'Godfather'</I> or even a patch on Scorsese's earlier crime thrillers such as <I>'Taxi Driver'</I> or <I>'Mean Streets'</I>.\r\n\r\n<p><B>L:</B> You're just too nice. My view: great cast, adequate direction, godawful script. Avoid like the plague and watch "Infernal Affairs" instead (but don't watch the sequels).\r\n\r\n<p><B>R:</B> Ok, 1 star (Lal) + 3 stars (me) divided by 2 = 2 stars = Adequate.\r\n\r\n<p><B>L:</B> Adequate. It's a nicer word than I would use. You have been warned!</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	364	2012-03-08

383	1	15	Blah	The History Boys	<p>School's out for summer and the A-Level results are in. Eight boys at a Yorkshire grammar school have managed to get exceptional grades and are planning to tackle the entrance exams at Oxford and Cambridge. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhile the group of young men are lively and boisterous, largely thanks to the freedom they are allowed by eccentric teacher Hector (Richard Griffiths - Harry Potter), the school's Headmaster believes the boys require some extra polish if they are to stand a chance of getting in to the top Universities. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe solution is young professional Mr Irwin, whose teaching style is the polar opposite to Hector's unique technique. Slowly the class begins to see the value in Irwin's methods while Hector's career is put in jeopardy after it is revealed he gropes his students when offering them lifts home on his motorbike. Can the boys make the grade without Hector's guidance or is Mr Irwin's approach to learning enough? \r\n</p><p>\r\nAlan Bennett's acclaimed play has made the transition from the boards of the National Theatre to the big screen but unfortunately fails to fill this larger canvas. The hugely entertaining script remains and the cast, who have followed the project from its earlier stage incarnation, are superb but the plot feels confined to the conventions of a play. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe ideas that are toyed with seem too big to be trapped in the four walls of the boy's classroom and as a result they lose something in their delivery. The classroom does witness some very funny lessons, particularly Hector's role-playing French oral exercise which takes place in an imaginary brothel. \r\n</p><p>\r\nHector's take on education is that anything and everything should be absorbed and it is the boys who should take the lead in determining what they want to study. Mr Irwin's approach is more practical with results more important than facts. He challenges the students to look at questions from unusual angles to get them noticed, whether their arguments are particularly valid or not. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThese opposing views about the real purpose of education make for a fascinating debate and both Griffiths and Stephen Campbell Moore (Normal for Norfolk), who plays Mr Irwin, are both very persuasive. The characters of the teenagers themselves are entertaining, although some get more attention than others especially as the film deviates from academic studies near the end to its detriment. The problem is that it all goes a bit, well, gay. While it isn't beyond the realm of possibility that one boy in the class is openly homosexual, even considering the coincidence that his teacher happens to have a weakness for young men, but the film's credibility is stretched to its limits when, as the final curtain approaches, even more characters reveal their true sexuality and the previous theme of what really is important about education is superseded by the potential coupling between some of the leads. \r\n</p><p>\r\nBeyond the humour, The History Boys has much to recommend it, not least the question of what exactly our children should be taught in schools. Ultimately, however a film such as this stands or falls on the strength of its characters and in the end several of them simply don't ring true.\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	383	2012-03-08

Meet uptight and straight-laced Meredith Morton (Sarah Jessica Parker - Sex and the City [TV]) who accompanies her boyfriend Everett Stone (Dermot Mulroney - The Wedding Date) to meet the Stone clan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meredith is so nervous and really wants to make a good impression, especially after her first encounter with younger sister, Amy (Rachel McAdams - Red Eye), had not gone so smoothly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only does Meredith have to sweet talk Amy but she also has to win over the open-minded yet cynical mother Sybil (Diane Keaton - Something's Gotta Give).  Thankfully the rest of the Stone family are pretty easy to get on with but even though they are all accommodating, Meredith still manages to put her foot in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To the Stone family, Meredith comes across as opinionated and uptight and somehow she always seems to say the wrong thing at the wrong time.  If only she had someone with her who knew the real her.  Cue Meredith's sister Julie (Claire Danes - Terminator 3) who is called in for emotional support after Meredith takes a bashing from the Stone family. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Julie seems to fit the Stone family's mould perfectly, Meredith only manages to get on with Everett's brother Ben (Luke Wilson - Anchorman).  Likewise, Everett has taken a shining to Meredith's sister Julie.  As you can imagine, this is where the fun begins and relationships get even more complicated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sarah Jessica Parker performs well, and against her stereotype, as the uptight and classy businesswoman who could not be more different from the Stone family.  Dermot Mulroney is his usual dapper and suave self as the love interest and Claire Danes is suitably sweet as the popular sister.  Meanwhile Luke Wilson adds some much needed humour to what is principally a sad and emotional film.  Diane Keaton plays the central character in all the emotional scenes and puts in a heartfelt performance as Mrs Stone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Family Stone is a festive family drama with plenty of emotional scenes and sparse humour mixed in.  Watch it if you are looking for a heartfelt family movie but avoid it if you are looking for a family comedy.  You will enjoy this movie if you liked <i>"In her Shoes"</i> but minus the funny factor.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	239	2011-03-26

427	1	20	\N	Ghost Rider	<p>\r\nLegend tells of many a man who sold his soul to the devil and the invariably nasty things that happened afterwards. The art world has also grasped this with classics such as <i>'Faustus'</i>, through to country songs such as <i>'The Devil Went to Georgia'</i>, and of course the comedy <i>'Bedazzled'</i>. Hidden among these was the comic book series <i>'Ghost Rider'</i>, now transformed into a big budget action movie.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn brief the story centers on a motorcycle stunt rider, Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage - National Treasure) who sold his soul at a young age to try and save his ailing father. Years later the devil in the form of Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda - Easy Rider) learns that his demonic son is searching for a powerful evil artifact. To stop his son he transforms Johnny Blaze into the Ghost Rider, a demon with a flaming skull and hands, and agrees to return his soul in exchange for tracking down his evil progeny. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe Ghost Rider is a powerful dark spirit that posses Johnny Blaze and rides a huge flaming motorcycle at speeds that shatter nearby windows and with fire from the wheels that melts tarmac on contact. Hardly a very subtle form of transport, Johnny's first night ride makes the evening news and the police are soon on his tail.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWhat follows is a paint it by numbers comic hero movie including regular features such as the tormented love interest who learns the hero's dark secret, the wise old man who offers advice and back story, the comedy sidekick who may or may not survive the movie, and of course tones of action and imaginative stunts.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSo is it a brilliant <i>'Batman Begins'</i> or a lame <i>'Elektra'</i>? \r\n</p><p>\r\nSadly, despite some potential for really dark storytelling, this film is aimed for the "wider" audience and became a clich ridden action flick that didn't really do anything new. Before I sound like I am slagging it off too badly, this is a fun entertaining film, just a bit...average.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe crucial elements in this type of film are the central hero and villain, the special effects and the action sequences. While Nicolas Cage was impressive and witty as Johnny Blaze, his character wasn't that enigmatic and his fiery alter ego, cool to look at, didn't really connect in any way. He is just a growling big bloke with a chain, which leads us onto the effects. Meanwhile the baddie, Blackheart (Wes Bentley - American Beauty), looked like he strayed from an episode of Buffy and wasn't really that frightening or threatening.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWay back in 1999 in Tim Burton's <i>'Sleepy Hollow'</i> the special effects minions made a fine gruesome job of imitating flesh, skin and muscle creeping back over the horseman's skull until finally the face of Christopher Walken (even more terrifying) was fully formed. Eight years on you would hope for some improvement in effects but sadly no. The skull and fire of Ghost Rider look obviously grafted on and did not always work well with the live action body movements. Maybe in a further eight years developments in computer effects will rejuvenate this demon but for now he is so-so. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAs for action sequences, there are some fun motorcycle stunts at the beginning that are so absurd that they generate laughs rather than suspense and a few good flaming bike rides through darkened city streets breaking windows and melting tar but other than that the fight sequences were generally short lived and unoriginal.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOn the plus side Eva Mendes (Trust the Man) puts in a busty performance as the love interest and marvel alumni Sam Elliott (The Hulk) adds more gravel vocals as the know-it-all graveyard caretaker who educates Nicolas Cage about his demonic problem.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nAt the end of the day this is another of those guilty pleasure movies like 'Con Air', 'National Treasure', 'The Rock'...hang on, I think I see a pattern forming. \r\n</p><p>\r\nGhost Rider is a good laugh with some thrills but otherwise fairly forgettable. Think of it as a cross between <i>'Constantine'</i>, <i>'Sleepy Hollow'</i> and <i>'Con Air'</i>.\r\n</p>	2	2011-03-26	427	2011-03-26
428	1	12	\N	Curse of the Golden Flower	<p>\r\n'Gold and jade on the outside, rot and decay on the inside', goes the Chinese proverb that inspired Zhang Yimou to take a famous play set \r\nin the 1920s and transpose it a thousand years to the days of the \r\nlatter Tang Dynasty. His adaptation of Cao Yu's <i>Thunderstorm</i> \r\nreplaces a wealthy industrialist family with the Chinese Imperial \r\nfamily, but the underlying tale of incest, deceit, ambition and \r\nbetrayal remains largely the same. The play is considered to be one \r\nof China's finest works of literature and lends considerable weight \r\nto the film's narrative, something that was notably lacking in both \r\n<i>Hero</i> and <i>House Of Flying Daggers</i>. More Shakesperian \r\ntragedy than the action of his previous two <i>wuxia</i> (Chinese \r\nmartial arts) films, <i>Curse Of The Golden Flower</i> is quite \r\npossibly one of Yimou's finest films.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOn the eve of the Chong Yang Festival, Prince Jai (Jay Chou - \r\n<i>Initial-D</i>) returns home to celebrate the holiday with his \r\nfamily. He is joined by the Emperor (Chow Yun Fat - <i>Bullet-Proof \r\nMonk</i>), but this seemingly joyful reunion masks the intrigue that \r\nhas been going on in the court during the Prince's three year \r\nabsence. His elder brother, the Crown Prince (Ye Liu), has been \r\nhaving an affair with his adopted mother the Empress (Gong Li - \r\n<i>Hannibal Rising</i>), but wants to leave the palace to be with his true love Chan (Li Man). The Empress, on the other hand, is behaving \r\nstrangely, besotted with the Crown Prince and obsessively sewing \r\nchrysanthemums (the titular golden flower). She takes medicine for a \r\nchronic illness, but discovers that her recent decline in condition \r\nis the result of deliberate poisoning on the orders of the Emperor. \r\nUnable to defy him openly, she instead instigates her own plot to \r\ntake revenge. Which side will Prince Jai take, and what of the \r\nyoungest son, Prince Yan (Junjie Qin), who appears to be the most \r\nobedient and filial yet lurks in the shadows of the palace, listening to all of its secrets?\r\n</p><p>\r\nContrasting the grandeur of the Imperial family with the ugliness \r\nhidden beneath, the gold and jade of the proverb are represented with incredibly ornate sets and costumes. If you thought that the Peony \r\nPavilion of <i>House Of Flying Daggers</i> was extravagant, <i>Curse \r\nOf The Golden Flower</i> takes it up to 11. The colour gold is used \r\nextensively throughout the lavish Imperial Palace set, and also for \r\nthe elaborate costumes, hand-crafted by a team of 40 seamstresses and embroiderers. Iridescent glass is used to off-set the gold in the \r\npalace for a stunning visual effect, but it all comes across as gaudy in comparison to the wonderfully co-ordinated colours of <i>Hero</i>. Yimou has chosen to emphasise the opulence in order to literalise the proverb, but even with this knowledge in mind the overall effect is \r\nof hallucinogenic overload. Burned-out retinas may also result.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAn excellent story is nothing without the acting to back it up, and \r\nYimou scores on two counts with his leads. Chow-Yun Fat has come a \r\nlong way since his days as Hong Kong's king of cool, and his \r\nperformance builds on his efforts in <i>Crouching Tiger, Hidden \r\nDragon</i> while at the same time providing a stark contrast to the \r\nnoble and heroic character of that film. The Emperor's role may have \r\nbeen difficult for an actor who is almost always a hero, but he plays an utter bastard with ease. His mental breakdown towards the film's \r\nend is nothing short of masterful. As for the Empress it is doubtful \r\nthat Yimou had any actress in mind other than Gong Li, but for all \r\nthat this film marks the first collaboration between Yimou and his \r\nformer lover/muse in over 11 years. In interviews, Li said that \r\nspending about four hours each day getting into her costume prepared \r\nher for playing the Empress, and she is more than a match for Yun- \r\nFat's Emperor. The Empress is the most complex of all the characters \r\nand has the most emotional range, but Li covers all the bases from \r\nregal and sexy to obsessive and manipulative. Her Hollywood career \r\nseems to be finally taking off, but she is still at her best in her \r\nnative language.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIt should be a universal rule that pretty-boy singers are more often \r\nthan not lousy actors, but the decision to cast Jay Chou was \r\nblatantly a commercial one to bring his legion of (mostly female) \r\nfans to the cinemas. While he was merely adequate in <i>Initial-D</i>, in this film he is up against Chow Yun-Fat and Gong Li and he \r\nfares badly. To be fair to him, most actors would have had their work cut out for them, but the role should really have gone to \r\nsomeone who could have done it justice. The rest of the cast play \r\ntheir parts in deference to the stars of the show, but Li Man \r\nprovides a surprisingly accomplished performance for a debut film.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe action scenes are confined to the epic battle on the grounds of \r\nthe Imperial Palace at the end of the film, but there are a couple of other notable scenes such as the superb duel between Prince Jai and \r\nthe Emperor, and the ninja-esque ambush later on in the film. The \r\nlatter scene stands out since it takes place at night and there is \r\nvery little contrast between the black of the attacking ninjas and \r\nthe dull colours worn by their victims. This provides a welcome \r\nrespite from the sensory battering of the rest of the film, but soon \r\nenough this leads into a climatic battle between thousands of golden \r\nwarriors and silver defenders in the grounds of the palace. The \r\nbattle has the same kind of jaw-dropping scale of those seen in \r\n<i>Lord Of The Rings</i>, and CGI is used at certain moments but kept to a minimum with up to a thousand extras drafted in from the Chinese Army. It provides a suitably apocalyptic finale for the destruction \r\nof the Imperial family at its own hands.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOn a par with <i>Hero</i> and far better than the farcical <I>House \r\nOf Flying Daggers</i>, <i>Curse Of The Golden Flower</i> marks a \r\nreturn to form for Zhang Yimou and shows Tsui Hark and Chen Kaige how to do a proper epic <i>wuxia</i> film. Highly recommended.</p>\r\n\r\n	4	2011-03-26	428	2011-03-26
431	1	15	\N	The Number 23	<p>\r\nJim Carrey admirably likes to test his acting range and has given several excellent performances in films such as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and The Truman Show that aren't simply variations on his usual physical comedy routine. \r\n</p><P>\r\nThe Number 23 represents his most radical departure yet from the slapstick films on which his success has been based. Carrey plays Walter Sparrow a dogcatcher who, thanks to an encounter with a particularly bad tempered canine, is late collecting his wife Agatha (Virginia Madsen - Sideways) from work. \r\n</p><P>\r\nWhile she waits Agatha purchases a self-published book called 'The Number 23' for her husband, an ominous tale of obsession. Walter becomes engrossed in the story of a detective and the deaths which surround him, deaths which all hinge on the mysterious number 23. Walter however soon notices eerie similarities between the protagonist and his own life, frightening his family as he begins a quest to track down the book's author and the book's connection to him. \r\n</p><P>\r\nThe film eventually boils down to a fairly mundane murder mystery but never has a plot taken a more circuitous, not to mention ludicrous, route to get to its conclusion. Along the way the audience is expected to swallow bizarre revelations and astronomical coincidences because they have been told that the number 23 has special significance in the universe and connects everything in Walter's life. As a plot device it is handy to say the least. \r\n</p><P>\r\nSparrow frequently finds himself in a dream world based on the book's plot, where all the central characters have been replaced by figures from his real existence. While some of this fantasy imagery is stylishly executed it often feels superfluous to the plot and Carrey frankly has too much comedy baggage to portray a reticent hard-boiled detective without inadvertently raising a smirk with his audience. \r\n</p><P>\r\nVirginia Madsen joins Carrey in the ranks of the miscast in her duel role of patient and caring wife in the real world and sultry femme fatale in the novel. She's perfectly good playing the first but she doesn't have the glamour to pull off the second. \r\n</p><P>\r\nWith a running time that stretches audience's patience and a plot that breaks all notions of credibility <i>'The Number 23'</i> is car crash cinema at its best. It is a film where talented people have clearly lavished time on a project that despite their sincerest efforts still manages to be totally abysmal.\r\n</p>	1	2011-03-26	431	2011-03-26
432	1	15	\N	The Last King of Scotland	<p>This film would score at least a 4 out of 5 if an extra 10-15 minutes of script/film had been added. Co-written by James Marsh and Milo Addica (Monsters Ball, The King is striking and shocking. However, what it lacks is depth and background to the reasons behind Elvis Sandow's (Gael Garcia Bernal) actions. Though slight revelations to Elvis' background are made throughout the film these are non-revelatory and lack substance. Elvis' history is not painted early on and what results is a film that wanders from the sweet and sensual to the brutal and bloody, leaving the audience throughout with more questions than answers.\r\n</p><p>\r\nStrong, if not outstanding, performances are displayed throughout by the four lead characters: Elvis Sandow (Gael Garcia Bernal - Bad Education), Pastor David Sandow (William Hurt - A History of Violence), Malerie Sandow (Pell James - Uptown Girls) and Paul Sandow (Paul Dano - Taking Lives), it is a pity they are let down by the omissions within the script. Perhaps the strong influences of religion, the story of Cain and Abel and the theme of redemption play a part in this omission, what can't be forgotten however are the strong musical talents of Pell James and the twinkly eyes/bewitching smile of Gael Garcia Bernal. \r\n</p><p>\r\nUnless you are a budding actor, wait for the DVD release and with it a Director's Cut that hopefully will fill the gaps presented in its cinematic release.\r\n</p>	4	2011-03-26	432	2011-03-26
434	1	23	\N	Rescue Dawn	<p>\r\nThere is a simple moment towards the end of Rescue Dawn that sums up the lunacy of the Vietnam War more effectively than the sum total of brilliant but misguided epics like Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter. \r\n</p><p>\r\nHaving been shot down, tortured, imprisoned for six months and ravaged by the Laotian jungle, navy pilot Dieter Dengler (Christian Bale - The Prestige) spots some US helicopters and builds a fire to attract their attention. As he joyfully waves his hands, confident of imminent rescue, they shoot at him. "Why are they shooting at us?" he shouts, expressing the dismay that a simple, practical man must feel in the face of such chaos. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIt's an understated bit of filmmaking, but says far more about the war than all the napalm, Russian roulette and obese Marlon Brando mumblings of the two, arguably, most famous cinematic depictions of 'Nam. The anguish with which Christian Bale delivers this simple line encapsulates the 'can this really be happening' dismay that must have been felt by the participants of a war without glory, justification or an enemy that could be fought on any conventional terms. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThis is what makes German director Werner Herzog's (The Wild Blue Yonder) take on Vietnam so satisfying, it doesn't use bombast or cynical emotional manipulation to make its points, it just tells a remarkable true story as it happened. \r\n</p><p>\r\nChristian Bale's central performance is unsurprisingly excellent, and, equally unsurprisingly, he clearly suffered for the role. The emaciated Dieter we see being lifted aloft by his adoring shipmates at the film's conclusion is a far cry from the white teethed naval aviator being briefed before the fateful opening mission. Werner Herzog is notorious for putting his cast and crew through real dangers comparable to those experienced by his characters, but you can bet Bale was more than up to the challenge. His almost Jackass-esque desire to put himself on the line for his art sees him being sucked by leeches, hung upside down with dung strapped to his face, put in a well and flung down a jungle hill by a deluge of water. Steve Zahn (Sahara) also delivers a moving turn as Dengler's frail fellow captive and escapee Duane. The bearded actor's usually irritatingly whiny Minnesota drawl is softened to create a real sense of the dehumanising effects of a year and a half in captivity. The emotional bond he forms with Dieter, in and out of the prison camp, extends way beyond necessity and forms the emotional core of the film. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIt does not spoil Rescue Dawn's conclusion to say it is Duane's fate that lingers in the mind longer than Dieter being held aloft by his shipmates upon his return. It is in this moment lies the real nature of war, not heroism, rescue or honour but thoughtless, manic, brutality.\r\n</p>	4	2011-03-26	434	2011-03-26
436	1	15	\N	Zodiac	<p>\r\nThe release of a David Fincher film is always an event. The director responsible for <i>Seven</i> and <i>Fight Club</i> almost guarantees quality by his very participation in a project and true to form Zodiac continues his winning run of grown up intelligent thrillers. \r\n</p><p>\r\nBased on Robert Graysmith's book <i>Zodiac</i>, the film meticulously follows the true story of the police investigation, and later Graysmith's own attempt, to solve several murders in and around San Francisco carried out by a publicity seeking serial killer known as the Zodiac. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWith extraordinary attention devoted to period detail the film focuses on the key investigators over 25 years as they sacrifice their careers and personal relationships to catch the murderer. All of Fincher's classic movie trademarks are present and correct. One ill fated taxi is followed from high above as it winds about the city in a long tracking shot that is reminiscent of Fincher's work in Panic Room. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe usually tranquil scenery of San Francisco is transformed into the kind of threatening urban environment more often associated with New York. An atmosphere of panic and paranoia grips the city and this tension holds the attention of the viewer during the picture's considerable running time. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWith such a long film, especially one so packed with essential dialogue, it is vital the characters delivering the facts are engaging. Zodiac himself, at least in his form as a masked killer, doesn't put in an appearance until after the film's first half hour. It is the efforts of his pursuers that drive this film forward. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAll three of the principal protagonists give excellent performances. Jake Gyllenhaal's (Jarhead) schoolboy enthusiasm for the investigation never falters even as he neglects those around him. Mark Ruffalo's (Just Like Heaven) easy going policeman becomes increasingly jaded and weary by the fruitless pursuit until he loses all faith that the killer will ever be caught. Finally hotshot journalist Robert Downey Jr (A Scanner Darkly) self destructs in a haze of drugs and booze after he is personally threatened by the Zodiac.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSince the Zodiac murders remain officially unsolved and in some districts are still under open police investigation to this day, a two and three quarter hour film on the subject must prove to be an infuriating watch if the killer is never caught? To the film's great credit, when the trail goes cold or hits dead ends the disappointment and frustration of the police are matched by those of the viewer. \r\n</p><p>\r\nUltimately when the revelations come and the breakthroughs occur the audience is swept up in the triumph of Graysmith's investigation. Zodiac doesn't answer every question conclusively but the pursuit of those answers is never anything but gripping. The film does put forward a compelling case for a prosecution that will never be made and I found that satisfying enough.\r\n</p>	5	2011-03-26	436	2011-03-26
438	1	23	\N	The Hills Have Eyes II	<p>Cross-country trips always seem to end in disaster in America. You would think city folk wouldn't keep on trying to take that short cut through wild country just because the toothless hick with the squint at the gas station says so. The not-happy-for-long campers this time are the Carter family who are driving across the New Mexico desert to get to San Diego and Dad Bob (Ted Levine - Memoirs of a Geisha) just can't resist that dirt track.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If this all sounds familiar it's because The Hills Have Eyes is a remake of Wes Craven's 1977 original or maybe because House of Wax and plenty of other films very much like it have followed exactly the same premise. Where this remake tries to differentiate itself from its predecessor is by offering up a nuclear fallout explanation for the bloodthirsty mutants that wait in the wilderness for their prey. This idea gives the film a few nice touches but what actually sets it apart is that the victims aren't a bunch of college jocks but a family, and the cast are made up of people who can act and aren't just taking time out from a stalling pop career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The principal reason this film is largely successful is because it invests enough time at the start of the movie in setting up a group of characters whose fate you do at least take some sort of interest in. Aaron Stanford (X2) is the pick of the bunch putting in a strong performance as the mild mobile phones salesman and young father who must fight for the first time in his life to protect his family. Teenager Bobby (Dan Byrd - A Cinderella Story) also gets to have some fun playing the resourceful boy scout as he sets up traps to discourage the freaks up among the rocks from approaching the shelter of the family's broken down trailer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hills Have Eyes represents part of a new gush of American horror flicks that are rejecting recent trends for tame bloodless 'horror' that younger audiences are allowed to watch and instead are forgoing the lower cinema certificates (and thus higher grosses) so they can push the boundaries of what is acceptable. A splash of colour, preferably red, certainly livens up proceedings and The Hills Have Eyes is a considerably more interesting two hours than the recently released, and appallingly bland, remake of <i>The Fog</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, while a storyline that features someone being hit in the head with a pickaxe and an ice cream freezer stuffed with severed limbs couldn't be described as easy watching for the squeamish, if the filmmakers' intention was to shock its audience it largely fails. Gory films, even though recently out of favour, are nothing new and the sexual assaults that take place during the initial attack on the family mostly take place behind the closed door of their silver trailer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film, while at times tense, is never frightening resulting in an end product that could be described as a competently made but very violent action film. Certainly the last 45 minutes, as the survivors of the first attack set about taking the fight to the enemy, is an exciting watch. It is hard not to cheer on each act of nasty retribution, although eventually I began to feel sorry for the unsuspecting mutants with their wonky teeth and old fashioned values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end the question must be asked whether remaking the film was worthwhile. It adds nothing to its genre that hasn't been witnessed a dozen times before but is still probably the best horror release of the year so far. Perhaps if everyone involved had devoted their talents to something original the film would have had more of an impact but the end result is a movie that in the future will struggle to cleave its way from the rest of the crowd.</p>\r\n	1	2011-03-26	438	2011-03-26
440	1	12	\N	TMNT	<p>\r\nGiven Hollywood's propensity for taking advantage of nostalgia trips\r\nby raping pretty much everyone's childhood memories, the jaded film-\r\ngoer won't look too deeply into the whys and wherefores of remakes.\r\nNonetheless, curiosity won out and a quick Google revealed that this\r\nlatest cinema excursion of the heroes in a half-shell was prompted by\r\na reboot of the cartoon, resurrected four years ago as a much closer\r\nadaptation of the original comic. Thus, things are darker and more\r\nrealistic - well, as realistic as things can get when you're dealing\r\nwith giant turtles.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWe're going to assume that you're familiar with the concept. If not,\r\na one-line summary follows: giant turtles fight crime. Taking place\r\nafter the three live-action films (no, I don't know what happened in\r\nthe second two and you don't really need to know - the third film\r\ninvolved going back to feudal-era Japan, so you truly are better off\r\nnot knowing), the Turtles have fractured as a family. Leonardo, the\r\nteam's leader, has been sent on a training trip to the jungles of\r\nSouth America by the Turtles' adopted father and teacher, Splinter,\r\nwhile the other three have made their own lives and careers back in\r\nNew York. Meanwhile April O' Neil (voiced by Sarah Michelle Gellar - <i>The\r\nGrudge 2</i>), a friend of the Turtles, has been scouring the very\r\nsame jungles on behalf of the wealthy industrialist Max Winters\r\n(voiced by Patrick Stewart - <i>X-Men: The Last Stand </i>), in search of\r\nancient warrior statues that Winters is collecting for some seemingly\r\nnefarious purpose. Tracking down Leonardo, April convinces him to\r\nreturn to New York and reunite the Turtles, just in time to team-up\r\nwith April's vigilante boyfriend Casey and take on Karai (voiced by Zhang Ziyi\r\n- <i>Memoirs Of A Geisha</i>) and the Foot Clan ninjas, some giant\r\nmonsters, Winters's stone generals, and Winter himself.\r\n</p><p>\r\nEschewing costly live-action in favour of CGI, Kevin Munroe's reboot\r\nof the franchise is a surprisingly accomplished effort. Zero points\r\nare awarded for originality, but writer and director Munroe has\r\ndone a very good job of introducing the characters to a new audience.\r\nFollowing the recent cartoon's lead, the extraneous baggage\r\nintroduced for the original cartoon have been ditched, streamlining\r\nthe cast and allowing focus on the Turtles themselves. Fans of the\r\ncomic will be rejoicing about the return to gritty realism (if\r\nbemoaning the lack of fatalities), while fans of the original\r\ncartoon may be wondering what happened to Bebop, Rocksteady et al.\r\n</p><p>\r\nLuckily the darker nature of the film does not rule out any humour;\r\n<i>TMNT</i> is absolutely hilarious at times, with a wide variety of\r\nsituation comedy and sharp dialogue. Munroe demonstrates an\r\nunfortunate tin-ear for the more emotive dialogue between Raphael and\r\nLeonardo, as well as in scenes towards the film's close, but the\r\ngreat one-liners more than make up for the cheese, helped along by\r\ncompetent voice-acting.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMichaelango and Donatello suffer in much the same way as always,\r\nplaying second-fiddles to the core pair of Turtles, which is a shame\r\nas all four have distinctive personalities but these two are\r\ncardboard in their respective personas as team clown and team boffin.\r\nIf a sequel does rear its head in the future, Munroe would do well to\r\nflesh-out all of the characters. Worrying about characterisation in a\r\nkids film could be viewed as a needless concern, but if the sublime\r\n<i>Monster House</i> and <i>The Incredibles</i> can do it, then there\r\nis no excuse for playing dumb just to keep the kids happy.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWith those films in mind, <i>TMNT</i> shares a similarly striking\r\nvisual style in the narrow limbs and angular faces of its characters,\r\nWinters bearing more than a passing resemblance to Mr Incredible with\r\nhis incredibly square jaw and huge frame. Munroe's direction is\r\nengrossing and makes full use of CGI's advantages over film, with\r\nscenes such as Michelangelo's dizzying skateboard run through the\r\ntunnels and sewers of New York and a cool tracking shot of Raphael\r\nplunging off the top of a building, while in the background his\r\nbrothers descend <i>through</i> the building on the back of a monster.\r\n</p><p>\r\nNot quite on a par with <i>Monster House</i> and <i>The Incredibles\r\n</i>, <i>TMNT</i> is still head and shoulders above the deluge of\r\nanthropomorphic nonsense being spewed out with no sign of abatement.\r\nEntertaining for fans and non-fans alike, the Turtles are, to\r\nparaphrase the first film's tag-line, lean, green and back on the\r\nscreen.

441	1	15	\N	Music and Lyrics	<p>\r\nThis year's big Valentine's Day release sees Hugh Grant (Love Actually) playing fading eighties pop star Alex Fletcher, whose performances at school reunions, theme parks and state fairs are becoming fewer by the year. A career lifeline presents itself when writhing teen superstar Cora Corman (Haley Bennett) reveals herself as a fan of Alex's eighties hits and asks him to write a song for her new album. The catch is it has to be done by the end of the week and Alex, while a master at writing music, hasn't a clue when it comes to lyrics. \r\n</p><p>\r\nEnter Sophie (Drew Barrymore - Fever Pitch) who has been employed to water Alex's plants and by a coincidence of astronomical proportions just happens to have an untapped talent for writing a brilliant verse. The pair embark on a hectic working schedule which quickly leads to mutual attraction as they bicker their way to a great song. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe comedy in Music and Lyrics tends to be gently amusing rather than laugh out loud funny but as least the film doesn't contain any of those embarrassing moments where you end up looking like a pervert for taking someone on a first date to a film featuring an unexpected orgy or extended bestiality sequence. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe film, however, does follow the a-z of romantic comedy plotting from start to finish without variation or alteration. For instance Hugh's character is cynical but comes to see the error of his ways thanks to Drew's good nature, Drew's character has crazy foibles that Hugh ends up finding endearing and most importantly, at the end of the third act, Hugh acts like an arsehole and loses the girl but ends up winning her back by making a spectacle of his feelings during the finale. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIf that all sounds infuriating then Music and Lyrics probably isn't the film for you, but if you are tolerant of tried and tested romantic comedy conventions then it may well leave you feeling all warm and mushy inside.  The jokes tend to be gently amusing rather than laugh out loud funny but as a date movie it won't offend anyone's tastes\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	441	2011-03-26
443	1	15	\N	Notes on a Scandal	<p>\r\nPlaying the hero can be a bit dull. All the really plum roles in cinema are the cackling, scene stealing villains. Figures such as Darth Vader, Hannibal Lecter, Cruella De Vil and almost any character ever played by Alan Rickman loom larger in the public perception than their goody-two shoes adversaries. \r\n</p><p>\r\nNow add to their intimidating number Barbara Covett, secondary school history teacher and manipulative monster. Judi Dench (Casino Royale) has earned herself a worthy Best Actress Oscar nomination for playing Barbara in director Richard Eyre's Notes on a Scandal. Her performance is so good that she completely overshadows such seasoned veterans as Cate Blanchett (Elizabeth) and Bill Nighy (Underworld). \r\n</p><p>\r\nSheba (Blanchett) is the attractive, but inexperienced, new art teacher starting work in a London comprehensive school. She quickly becomes friends with lonely Barbara, a teacher feared by staff and pupils alike. Life long spinster and closet lesbian Barbara sees something alluring in the new arrival and begins to insinuate herself into Sheba's life, dreaming they can have a future together where they are more than just colleagues. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSheba, however, has another relationship on her mind. Shackled in marriage to an older man (Nighy) and saddled with two difficult children, she longs for something new and exciting. Foolishly she embarks on a passionate affair with a fifteen-year-old pupil but prying Barbara soon discovers the liaison. Obsessed Barbara confronts her friend but decides not to reveal her crime to the authorities, preferring to use the information to further leverage herself into Sheba's confidence. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAs events spiral beyond either woman's control, Sheba begins to realise just how sinister her 'friend' really is. Both Blanchett and Nighy provide excellent supporting work but it is Dench who gets to have all the fun as the Machiavellian Barbara, a cold calculating woman who has no friends and no personal relationships of any kind. Her character's diary provides the amusingly biased narration to the plot. The film might have the scale of a BBC television drama but as an acting master class its only recent match has come from the lead performances in <i>The Queen</i>. The plot never quite develops into a thriller but it's a testament to Dench's performance that it is Barbara who emerges as the villain of the peace when it is in fact Sheba who has committed the crime.\r\n</p><p>	4	2011-03-26	443	2011-03-26
444	1	23	\N	Alpha Dog	<p>\r\nWhen a popstar makes the crossover to film us critics tend to sheath the knives and rev up the chainsaw. But, what is most surprising about <i>Alpha Dog</i> is that Justin Timberlake's (Edison) English cinema debut film performance is one of the best things about this rabid movie. His turn as Frankie, a vacuous stoner and hanger on to teenage LA drug dealer John Truelove (an average Emile Hirsch - Lords of Dogtown), at least communicates a little more depth than the rizzler-thin characterisations on offer elsewhere. \r\n</p><p>\r\nFrankie's as up to his neck as anyone in the horrific - and factual - crime of the abduction and murder of an innocent fifteen year old, but Timberlake imbues the character with just enough dumb charm to suggest he just doesn't see the dark chasm events are sliding towards. The rest of the young ensemble cast give passable performances, but the wide range of characters means you never get to know or care for any of them. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAnton Yelchin (Fierce People) is respectable as the hapless kidnapped-teen Zack, who is snatched because his volatile brother Jake (Ben Foster - The Punisher) owes Truelove money. He is at his best in the scenes when Truelove and his inept crew don't quite know what to do with their captive, so let him get stoned and party with them. However, Yelchin's good work is ruined by the clunky script, having Zack deliver a cringe-worthy speech about 'wanting to start again' just as he is being driven unbeknown to his death. It's not far from that old cinematic chestnut of the cop who seals his own fate by having pictures in his wallet of his boat/motorbike/condo in Florida and is 'two weeks from retirement'. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWriter/director Nick Cassavettes (The Notebook) tries so hard to create a sense of tragedy that he forgets that audiences don't need to be preached at. For example, a film like Larry Clark's <i>Kids</i> captures the amoral causality of America's MTV generations' attitudes to sex, drugs and death without having to get up on its soapbox. Also, Alpha Dog's script whimpers whereas Kids barks. Clark's use of slang and wince-inducing language works because it's creative and feels totally authentic. For all Alpha Dog's racism, homophobia and incessant mo' fo' ing, it still comes across like an episode of The OC with more blunts. \r\n</p><p>\r\nVeterans Sharon Stone (Catwoman) and Bruce Willis (Lucky Number Slevin) can do little to salvage this dog's dinner with what are little more than extended cameos, albeit interesting ones. \r\n</p><p>\r\nMost of Willis' performance as Sonny Truelove, Johnny's shady businessman father, is seen in mock interviews regarding his blatant knowledge of his on-the-run offspring's whereabouts. Intentionally or otherwise, he always does smug and deadpan well, so these snippets are some of the movie's most accomplished moments.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSharon Stone also does fine as the hysterical mother, until an ill conceived interview scene about her son's death where any emotional resonance is undercut by prosthetics that look like someone has attached Jabba the Hut to her face. The fact it is based on a true story makes sloppy moments like this even more annoying; when the audience should be most sucked into the drama, you are too busy chuckling at unintentional hilarity. The dog's bollocks; just not in a good way.\r\n</p>	2	2011-03-26	444	2011-03-26
447	1	27	\N	Meet The Robinsons	<p>Before the great empire that is China was formed, there were seven independent nations constantly at war. In Qin, one of the seven countries, the King desired peace through the unity. Alas, the only way to achieve unity was to conquer all seven nations. Of course this threw up more than a few enemies even if the King's motives were sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hero tells the story of the nameless warrior (Jet Li - The One) who arrives at the palace of the King of Qin (Daoming Chen) to report the death of the four most feared assassins from one of the neighbouring countries. The nameless warrior is cordially welcomed into the royal palace and invited to tell the emperor how he, one man, had succeeded against the most ruthless killers when so many before had failed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the nameless warrior tells his story we get to see flashbacks of his confrontations with the solitary spear wielding warrior, Sky (Donnie Yen - Blade II), the beautiful but tragic Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung), the young and passionate Moon (Zhang Ziyi - Rush Hour 2) and the thoughtful and wise Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu Wai - Infernal Affairs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With each part of the story told, the king allows the nameless warrior closer but the warrior may have underestimated the wisdom of the great king. The stories do not ring true in his mind and as the king searches through the warrior's tales to find the truth, we also see the layers of deception revealed. The truth is a powerful hidden story and when finally fully told is both tragic and inspiring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Director Yimou Zhang has created a visually rich film combining the stunning landscapes of China with tremendous wire fighting sequences that, although far fetched in western cinema, are an art form in their own right.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The severe and beautiful natural landscapes of China, the large armies and the location settings such as the royal palace and the besieged school of calligraphy, give a sense of scale to the movie that acts as much more than just a backdrop for the action. There is a strong attention to detail in each scene and this combined with a rich colour pallet gives the movie a great visual impact.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Jet Li is his usual quiet yet intense character in the lead role of the nameless warrior who narrates the various tales. In support, Tony Leung Chiu Wai has probably the most engaging character as assassin Broken Sword who has to choose between his various loyalties to either help the warrior or betray his love. Also worthy of special mention is Daoming Chen as the King of Qin who slowly unravels the tales of the nameless warrior. Although he spends most of his screen time seated, he displays a presence that gives his role as a King an air of sincerity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hero is a beautiful and artistic film set in the time before China. It is understandably filmed in Chinese and has English subtitles. The story, subtle at times, is also quite powerful. Why then should this artistic movie, this fine wine, be presented on 'Share My Popcorn'? A website devoted to the big budget crowd pleasers such as Collateral and Wimbledon? The answer is more complicated than the question but is full of hope, as is the movie.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The story of Hero and the cinematic style are truly artistic yet the film also contains excellent wire fighting sequences and kung fu. The casting of Jet Li in the principle role will attract western audiences who have enjoyed films such as 'The One' and 'Kiss of the Dragon'. In addition the popularity of 2000's Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon shows that there is a large and growing UK audience for artistic and thought provoking action movies from the Far East. Popcorn movies are above all other things popular, and whereas that used to suggest action films full of thin plots and big budget car chases, thankfully times are a changing.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>If you enjoyed Romeo Must Die, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or Kill Bill 1, I would recommend that you see this movie and more importantly see it on the big screen so you can get the most out of the great landscapes.</p> \r\n	9	2011-03-26	447	2011-03-26
448	1	27	\N	The Hitcher	<p>After a few years of fighting killer robots, Cuban drug lords and even swimming with sharks, Will Smith (Shark Tale) returns to his comedic roots in a great new romantic comedy. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smith plays Alex Hitchens, a godsend to desperate men looking for love. Branded as the 'date-doctor', Hitch acts as a 'cure for the common man'. His aim is to see decent and almost invisible men win the hearts of some of the most unobtainable women in New York.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hitch's natural charm works wonders with women and his methods of seduction are a sure fire hit. Well, at least for everyone else's love life. Hitch soon finds out that his cocky self assured philosophy doesn't seem to work so well in his own personal life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Hitch meets beautiful gossip columnist Sara (Eva Mendes - Stuck on you), he has a tough job on his hands to melt through her icy man-hating exterior. But once he has overcome that hurdle, things just seem to go from bad to worse as the couple encounter mishap after embarrassing mishap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a dedicated news hound, Sara never lets an exclusive story pass her by and when she discovers Hitch's true profession she is determined to bag the scoop regardless of the consequences. As the dating consultant and the gossip queen are set to collide, the stage is set for a classic romantic crisis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right now Will Smith can do no wrong and every film he features in is sure to be a huge box office success. Hitch is no different and gives Smith the chance to relive his Fresh Prince days and show us all what he does best, comedy.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Mention must also be given to Smith's most ambitious client to date, Kevin James (The King of Queens) as Albert, a chubby modest accountant with eyes for a wealthy and stunning celebrity way above his social ranking. Don't miss an array of unforgettable dance moves from this guy. Not forgetting Eva Mendes as the beautiful, if cynical, love interest to complement Smith's smooth talking and charming attributes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hitch has everything you would expect from a romantic comedy, although I must admit I was expecting a little more comedy from Smith's character. I forgive him though, Smith never disappoints and I will always be a huge fan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This film is great for the family, couples and especially teenagers who will probably appreciate the fantastic soundtrack (including my Usher fave, 'Yeah!'). If you liked 'How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days' or 'Shallow Hal' you will love this movie.</p>\r\n	9	2011-03-26	448	2011-03-26
449	1	15	\N	Sunshine	<p>\r\nThe Sun is dying, the light and heat it emits is fading away, condemning Earth and its entire population to a frozen death. One last chance remains, the space ship Icarus II and its crew of eight scientists and astronauts are heading straight to the very edge of the Sun's corona to deliver a massive stellar bomb that could create a new star from the embers of the old. \r\n</p><p>\r\nBeyond the reach of Earth's communications the crew pick up a new signal, the distress beacon of the Icarus I, the first attempt to reignite the Sun, lost without a trace seven years earlier. Thoughtful physicist Capa (Cillian Murphy - Batman Begins) decides to alter the ship's course to rendezvous with Icarus I and salvage its bomb, but the mission goes disastrously wrong forcing the ship's survivors to weigh the lives of their comrades with Earth's very survival. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSunshine's central premise seems to be cobbled together from films such as The Core and Event Horizon, hardly pictures that seem worthy of imitation. However, director Danny Boyle and his long time collaborator, writer Alex Garland, have history in reinvigorating tired formulas. In 2002 the pair conspired to produce the heart pounding zombie horror <i>28 Days Later</i>, which remains one of the all time highlights of what was previously a shambling genre of clichs. They perform a similar trick again. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIn <i>Sunshine</i> the familiar parade of lesser known actors meeting their demise in a variety of space accidents en route to saving the world somehow never makes one think of Armageddon. Why? The film has pretensions of serious science fiction with hints of philosophy, psychology and theology thrown in. Somehow Boyle and his fellow filmmakers largely manage to juggle these elements without detracting from the film's central blockbuster plot. That the film never looks or feels like a big budget Hollywood popcorn flick isn't to say that the production design and special effects aren't top quality.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe star of the show is undoubtedly the Sun itself, which is breathtakingly realised, beautiful and yet quite lethal. It is easy to see why so many of the crew become transfixed by it. Among the human performances Michelle Yeoh (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) is sadly wasted as the ship's botanist but Chris Evans (Cellular) is riveting as the realist who never loses sight of the mission, a man willing to make the tough decisions to ensure its success. Given the right role Evans has the potential to become a massive star in Hollywood. \r\n</p><p>\r\nPerhaps the film that Sunshine owes its greatest debt too is Ridley Scott's <i>Alien</i>, which is echoed in everything from the music, the claustrophobic cinematography through to the crew interaction. Eventually even the narrative resembles Alien's cat and mouse finale when the Capa discovers the Icarus has a guest onboard. Unfortunately it is in this last twenty minutes, when the deaths come in quick succession and the mission reaches its critical phase, that the artistic flourishes start to detract from the plot. In particular the blinding distortions accompanying one sun-drenched figure whenever he appears on screen makes the action difficult to follow. \r\n</p><p>\r\nNevertheless Sunshine proves to be much more than the sum of its parts making it the most satisfying grownup sci-fi film in a very long time.\r\n</p><p>	4	2011-03-26	449	2011-03-26
454	1	20	\N	Spider-Man 3	<p>\r\nPeter Parker is having a good time after a few years of stress but the recent popularity of his lycra clad alter ego is going to his head. The conflict between his nerdy photographer lifestyle and his web slinging crime fighter persona has steadied since the whole Doc Octopus saga and now he hopes to pop the question to understanding girlfriend Mary Jane.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAll this sweetness has to have a tinge of tragedy for us to be interested and it soon arrives in a bucket load. A mysterious meteorite crashes conveniently close to smooching Parker and MJ that contains a symbiotic alien entity that has the ability to heighten the reflexes and feeds on the emotions of its host. However, before the black parasite has a chance to latch onto Parker, he has enough time to confront another new foe, the Sand Man. \r\n</p><p>\r\nFlint Makro is an oafish thief who is accidentally atomized when he falls into an experimental device hidden in a poorly fenced off field (an insurance claim waiting to happen). Said fiend finds that his body has been turned into sand that he can manipulate with his mind hence the imaginative name 'Sand Man'. The motivation for this granular baddie is to raise enough money through theft to pay for the medical treatment his ailing daughter needs. Before that sounds too noble we are reminded that this guy was the one who shot Parker's uncle, even though that doesn't sit nicely with Spider-Man but the scriptwriter will wing that glitch later in the movie.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter a few bouts with Sand Man, some emotional tantrums with MJ whose career is on the skids and an aerial confrontation with his former best friend and new nemesis Harry Osborn, Parker needs a nap. He lays down for snooze and his body gets attacked by the slumbering alien parasite that feeds his rage and senses and transforms Parker into a darker edgier vigilante. He easily becomes addicted to the new powers his slick black suit offers and relegates his old red and blue fetish outfit.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nAdding to his wardrobe problems, Parker has one other small problem brewing. A rival photographer, Eddie Brock, is moving in on his job. Empowered by his black suit and suffering few fools, Parker soon ruins the career of Brock while also flirting successfully with Brock's blonde love interest. Brock, in response, blames Parker for his sudden fall from grace and shattered life.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThis all sounds good doesn't it? Well on paper it is. Sadly the movie itself doesn't come across as great as the content would suggest, at least not for me. Sam Raimi (Spider-Man 2) is an excellent director and he does manage to cram quite a bit into the movie but sadly this content isn't really explored and as there is so much to get through it all gets a bit weak and watery. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe action sequences are great and the effects are good and I have no doubt that the younger audience absolutely loved it, but as a big kid I was hoping for something darker and edgier. Maybe I am no longer the target audience, or maybe the film was as weak as piss. That's for you to decide.\r\n</p><p>\r\nTobey Maguire (The Good German) returns as Parker/Spider-Man and similar to earlier movies comes across as a bit wet. Similarly James Franco (Tristan & Isolde) as Harry Osborn is wooden and comes across more like a moody teenager waiting in the bushes with water bombs rather than an evil millionaire with heat seeking grenades. The acting highlight of the movie is actually Kirsten Dunst (Elizabethtown) as MJ. She gets to cry and laugh and is the only character who really connects with the audience. Meanwhile, on the villain front Topher Grace (In Good Company) is fairly annoying and Thomas Haden Church (Sideways) is a little lumbering as Sand Man.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAt the end of the day this film isn't about acting, it's about action and merchandising. The film has some entertaining moments but generally fails. I would like to see Spider-Man bow out of the cinema on a high note rather than this formulaic flop and maybe the rumoured Spider-Man 4 will deliver that fantastic finale...but I doubt it. \r\n</p>	2	2011-03-26	454	2011-03-26
455	1	15	\N	28 Weeks Later	\r\n<p>\r\n28 Weeks Later is set, well, twenty eight weeks after the initial outbreak of the Rage virus that completely devastated the population of Great Britain as seen in 28 Days Later. The infected have long succumbed to starvation and British survivors are moving back into the safe green zone centred on the high-rise towers of Canary Wharf under the close supervision of the United States military. \r\n</p><P>\r\nThe youngest of the new arrivals are children Tammy (Imogen Poots) and Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) who are reunited with their shifty father Don (Robert Carlyle - Trainspotting), a man who survived the initial outbreak by abandoning his wife to the virus. \r\n</p><P>\r\nBeyond the heavily fortified green zone all of London stretches out completely deserted and the two inquisitive children decide to return to their old home to retrieve some valued possessions. What they don't expect to find is their Mum Alice, alive and seemingly well upstairs. The military's decision to bring her back into the green zone proves to be a catastrophic error. American doctor Scarlet (Rose Byrne - Sunshine) discovers that while Alice is immune to the virus, she is in fact a carrier and quickly the Rage spreads through the green zones civilian population. \r\n</p><P>\r\nWith the brutal military response not differentiating between innocent and infected, Scarlet tries to lead Tammy and Andy across London to safety with the help of a lone American sniper. \r\n</p><P>\r\n<i>28 Days Later</i> made big bucks upon its release in America despite its shoestring budget and unknown cast. This sequel may have been slow to materialise but it has finally arrived with a much bigger budget to match its far greater ambition. The original's big money moment was a ten second camera shot of a tranquil river Thames winding through central London with not a moving car, cab, boat, bus or pedestrian in site. This sequel features the carpet bombing of the Isle of Dogs, the mass mincing of a hoard of the infected by a helicopter rotor and the first motion picture to make use of the new Wembley Stadium. Sadly all this extra dosh has cost the sequel the relentless kinetic energy which made 28 Days Later such a bruising cinematic experience. \r\n</p><P>\r\nThe glossy action is very professionally executed but it was the raw nature of its predecessor that made it so memorable. At times it feels the filmmakers are too concerned in commentating on current American military interventions around the world to the detriment of the film's actual plot. \r\n</p><P>\r\nCertainly the infected become somewhat lost in the mix during the chase across London with the men in uniform posing the larger threat. The film's two child stars do a commendable job but Robert Carlyle is wasted in his surprising role and Rose Byrne's doctor is underwritten. The film sorely misses a central everyman figure such as Cillian Murphy portrayed in the original that the audience can root for. \r\n</p><P>\r\n28 Weeks Later proves to be an enjoyable zombie horror that is a cut above most efforts in its genre. Unfortunately it just isn't as good as its predecessor.\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	455	2011-03-26
456	1	16	\N	Goodbye Bafana	\r\n<p>\r\nDuring the oppressive apartheid regime in South Africa, one man more than any other was determined to have his voice heard for the black population regardless of the consequences.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nNelson Mandela was fighting for freedom and equality for black people in what was then a white-dominated South Africa. But the reigning government did not agree with his political preaching and sentenced him to imprisonment on remote Robben Island. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nMeanwhile an aspiring white prison guard, James Gregory, (Joseph Fiennes - Running with Scissors) has high hopes for his career and family. In a once in a lifetime opportunity he is promoted to head the censorship department at Robben Island prison and secretly ordered to get close to Mandela and report back on his encounters.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nJames can speak fluent Kafa following his earlier childhood friendship with a black kid Bafana who worked at the family farm. The prison authorities are keen for James to use this ability to translate conversations between Mandela and his wife Winnie and learn more about his influence on the outside world.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nAt first James is caught up in all the reports about Mandela's fight against the whites and he too joins his fellow colleagues in berating the political leader. The system is designed to demean and demoralize the black political prisoners and James willingly helps.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nIt is only once he discovers some anomalies in his translations and gets hold of a banned document that Mandela spoke of that he realises that he, and white South Africa, have been duped by their superiors. As James gets closer to Mandela and becomes more sympathetic to his cause, the further he and his family will be pushed out and attacked for being traitors to the white population.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nFiennes is on top form as the strong willed and determined prison officer who will go as far as it takes to get justice for Mandela and his own family. He also puts on a very convincing South African accent for the part. Diane Kruger (National Treasure) is sweet but nave as James doting wife Gloria while Faith Ndukwana is her complete opposite as Winnie Mandela with a more defiant and independent attitude to life. Dennis Haysbert (The Unit [TV]) is superb as the intellectual and inspirational Mandela but his excellent acting skills are wasted with little dialogue or opportunity to really shine.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nGoodbye Bafana is an interesting take on the struggle of Nelson Mandela's fight for freedom. Nevertheless, the focus is more on the plight of the white population who feared the blacks than on the fight by Nelson Mandela against the oppression of the black population and his fight for equality and democracy. This movie, thought provoking as it is, only taps the surface of a wealth of possible stories and experiences from this recent era in history but remains a solid piece of cinema that'd recommend for fans of historical drama's such as <i>Gandhi</i>, <i>The Insider</i> and <i>Catch a Fire</i>.\r\n</p><p>\r\n<i><b>"No one is born hating another person because of the colour of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite."</i></b></p>\r\n<p><b>Nelson Mandela</b>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	456	2011-03-26
458	1	20	\N	Pirates of the Caribbean - At Worlds End	<p>\r\nAt the end of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Mans Chest, Captain Jack is dead; fed to the vile Kraken to appease vengeful Davy Jones and ensure safety for Elizabeth Swann and her wooden fiance Will Turner. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIn the closing moments of that movie we saw the remaining crew visit voodoo witch doctor Tia Dalma who offered them a way to rescue Captain Jack from the afterlife. As proof of the impossible she reintroduced our heroes to grizzled pirate Captain Barbossa who they last saw dead upon a pile of cursed gold. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWe rejoin Elizabeth and Barbossa as they visit the hidden den of a fearsome Chinese pirate who holds the key to safely visiting the land of the dead. As they haggle as best they can for the assistance of Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat - Curse of the Golden Flower) across the ocean the evil Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander - A Good Year) is hunting down all the world's pirates assisted by the enslaved Davy Jones. \r\n</p><p>\r\nBeckett is driven and determined to exterminate all piracy to secure the oceans for his beloved company and a monopoly on trade. Meanwhile in a third thread, antihero Captain Jack finds himself in the maddening afterlife and has his own ideas on how to escape.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAs with the two prequels this third movie is looooong. At 168 minutes it is stretching the patience of any person's buttock muscles. Thankfully this movie, similar to the first, is crammed with action sequences and shifting allegiances that manage to keep the audience attentive. The second chapter was quite slow in places and appeared to meander. This final chapter tries well to tie these random threads back together and make up for that turgid yet underrated second instalment. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSome highlights include the delusional hallucinations of Jack Sparrow in Davy Jones' locker, a thrilling plummet over the edge of the world and the comedic election of a pirate king. New set pieces, plenty of sword fighting, unexpected betrayals and deaths combined with plenty of jokes, this film is a fitting, if lengthy, end to the trilogy.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWith regard to acting the main characters remain on similar form as before; Johnny Depp is ever impressive as Jack Sparrow, Kiera Knightley is still as sexy but skinny, and Orlando Bloom remains pretty and wooden. That last comment may be unfair, I think Bloom has improved in this movie over his last pirate outing but still cannot compete with his co-stars. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAs with its predecessors, this movie's most memorable performances (other than Depp) come from the more minor characters such as Tom Hollander as the Machiavellian Lord Beckett, and Naomie Harris (Miami Vice) as Tia Dalma.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nNew introductions to the already numerous cast include Chow Yun-Fat as the Singaporean pirate lord Sao Feng and aged rocker Keith Richards (The Rolling Stones) in a surprising cameo as Captain Sparrow senior. Chow Yun-Fat typically fills his character with gravitas and is quite intimidating. His curious dwelling and the confrontations that occur there quickly establish him as a strong villain, or hero? In comparison to the aggressive Sao Feng, Keith Richards offers a more laid back yet equally impressive turn as Jack Sparrow's father.  Many rock stars have tried to leap the divide between music and movies and in this instance Richards managed to find his feet and deliver a memorable character. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSo now, after three lengthy pirate adventures, are we at the end of the saga? As with any self respecting blockbuster there remains the possibility for further adventures. Yo ho ho... and a bottle of rum.</p>\r\n\r\n  \r\n	3	2011-03-26	458	2011-03-26
459	1	23	\N	Flyboys	<p>\r\nStunning aerial jousts clash with predictable plotting and characters in this World War I fighter pilot epic. Flyboys comes alive when the fighters battle for supremacy over the trench warfare on the Western front. The fight sequences are a breathtaking rush of open skies, roaring engines and blazing machine guns. To say they are as good as anything ever filmed is no exaggeration. <i>Topgun</i> is the only real modern point of comparison, but the exhilarating precariousness of aerial tussles in planes that have only just been invented makes Flyboys' dogfights all the more satisfying. But, unsurprisingly, things on the ground are not nearly as exciting. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe film follows the fortunes of a group of Americans who sign up for the Lafayette Escadrille, a French airforce unit comprised mainly of their compatriots, as their country continues to pursue isolationism. Although some are supposedly based on real life Lafayette Escadrille pilots, the onscreen depicitons are rooted heavily in type. \r\nThe world-wearly fighter ace, the cocky square-jawed Texan, the shady type running from his past, the spoilt rich kid; all seem to have been cut-and-pasted from other war films. In a supporting role as the unit's commander, Jean Reno (The Da Vicini Code) continues his self perpetuated trend of being 'the Frenchman' in American films and delivers a workmanlike 'where's my cheque please' performance. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe love plot between former Texas rancher Blaine Rawlins (James Franco - Spider-Man 3) and local French girl Lucienne also doesn't convince. Newcomer Jennifer Decker gives a charming perfomance as the pretty waif, but the sequences are just there to fill in time for some more 'chocks away' aerial combat. But, when the engines rev and the propellors are hand-spun into life, Flyboys justifies its existence. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe unit's attack on a hulking zeppelin and it's fighter escort will surely go down as a landmark in onscreen depiction of the rush and terror of the war in the air. The sterility of the characters and script hold this back from being anything more than entertaining, but its fighter action means the long 140 minute running time zips and roars by.\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	459	2011-03-26
460	1	20	\N	Oceans Thirteen	<p>\r\nIn 2001, <i>Ocean's 11</i> was a smash hit con movie. A great cast, cool characters with a cool style taking on a nasty villain in a great con. The movie spawned several lesser contenders and then in 2004 the cast returned for an eagerly anticipated sequel, the imaginatively named <i>Oceans Twelve</i>. The expectation was high and the new movie changed the format completely and hence lost most of its audience. After a critical mauling it looked like the end for Danny Ocean and his team but now they return. Can they pull of a scam as miraculous as their plots and win back the audience? \r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nFatherly figure and mentor Ruben James (Elliot Gould - Oceans 12) strikes up a new business deal with industrious hotelier Willie Banks (Al Pacino - The Merchant of Venice) only to be stitched up and cut out of the contract. Financially ruined and manhandled by the mob, Ruben suffers a physical and emotional collapse.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nOn hearing the news that Ruben has been shafted protg Danny Ocean (George Clooney - The Good German) reassembles the team for a revenge job; a complicated sting to break both the reputation of Banks as well as his financial power.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter the lucrative heist in Ocean's 11 and the difficulty avoiding retribution from their victim in the second, Danny and his team do not intend to rob their latest mark. Instead they intend to let the general public do that by allowing everyone a three minute window when they simply cannot lose. With thousands of the public winning, their latest foe will soon see his bank balance fall through the floor and while Banks tries to regain control in the chaos, the lads will also work on ruining Banks reputation.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nThis latest heist movie in the franchise once again tries to reinvent "the big con" to keep the format fresh while retaining the elements the public loves. More akin to <i>Ocean's 11</i> (2001) than its more convoluted sequel <i>Ocean's 12</i> (2004), Ocean's 13 returns to Vegas and has a clear cut villain but wastes no time in laying out the detailed plan. Most con movies keep the scam a secret till the final showdown but Ocean's 13 instead lets you know the plan instead and then tries to throw a few spanners and red herrings into the mix to keep you attentive. This idea works well for the most part even if a cynic like me may feel it leaves little suspense or anticipation.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe new villain Willie Banks is suitably nasty but doesn't really intimidate like his predecessor Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia - Smokin' Aces) who returns this time to help Danny and company. This weakness in the film is not really through any fault of the ever-impressive Pacino but rather due to a lack of character development. Other than a brief nasty exchange with Ruben we don't get too strong an idea why Willie is so bad. These small oversights are easily forgotten as this is a popcorn movie at best. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nDirector Steven Soderbergh has clearly got a winning formula here that he can use to fund his other projects such as "The Good German". With the Ocean movies it looks like the cast are having fun and even the script shows flourishes of homage and comedy. In one scene we see Danny confronting Banks and stating in his Sinatra cool "What I want, what is most important to me...", a direct quote from the Godfather and a reference to Pacino in his breakthrough role. Similarly we see ailing Ruben in bed talking to Danny, "I hear cars coming and going, I hear Linus crying. I think you should tell me what everyone seems to know," in another Godfather quote. These are but two of many references for film fans to spot.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe visual style, the musical score, and the locations are all now as familiar and as welcoming as the hotels that feature so prominently (even if they don't actually exist). The format is well presented and the characters are like old friends we hope to see again. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nReturning in the central role as Danny Ocean, Clooney once again adds his smooth voice and cool nerves while Brad Pitt (Babel) resumes the sidekick character Rusty who, for the most part, runs the scams. Alongside the deceptive duo the original nine co-conspirators return and each again gets their small moment of drama. Notable among the supporting con artists are Don Cheadle (Reign Over Me) as the cockney demolition expert who at one stage dons extravagant teeth to mimic a disgruntled motorcycle stunt artist and Matt Damon (The Departed) as the former rookie who by now is a professional con artist and dons an absurd nose and dubious pheromones to woo and deceive Banks' ice queen assistant Abigail (Ellen Barkin - Trust the Man).\r\n</p><p>\r\nOverall this is a still a really nice movie and although it'll be more popular than the poorly received <i>Ocean's 12</i>, it may be the end of the franchise. It is a fitting end to a nice little trilogy and I hope they don't flog the already tired horse with a fourth instalment and opt instead to "quit while they're ahead".</p>	3	2011-03-26	460	2011-03-26
462	1	12	\N	Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer	<p>\r\nAfter dispatching (Doctor) Von Doom at the climax of the last film, the Fantastic Four of Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd - <i>Amazing Grace</i>), Sue Storm (Jessica Alba - <i>Into The Blue</i>), Johnny\r\nStorm (Chris Evans - <i>Sunshine</i>) and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis - <i>Fantastic Four</i>) are getting on with their new lives as superheroes in the public eye. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nReed and Sue are trying to get married, Ben is settling down with his girlfriend, and Johnny is still making\r\nfull use of his powers and looks to woo the ladies. Naturally a spanner in the works appears, in the form of a T-1000 lookalike alien dubbed the Silver Surfer. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThe Surfer is causing disruption on a planetary scale, creating huge craters in the Earth's surface and emitting bursts of the same cosmic radiation that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, but he is only the herald of a much deadlier threat.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nOn the face of things, Marvel has been getting it right with their superhero films. Barring the odd misstep here and there, they have far less to be ashamed of than Warner/DC, and they continue their run of\r\ngood superhero films with the latest Fantastic Four film. More of the same is no bad thing and this sequel does what all sequels should do, and that is to produce a more refined effort that builds on the foundation laid by the earlier film(s). So, more sharp dialogue, more CGI action sequences and more Jessica Alba looking less attractive as a blonde. Damn.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nMost of the issues with the first film have been sorted out - Gruffudd has had that pole removed from his arse, Evans is less of a cocky git, the team acts more like a team in the action sequences, and the story actually goes somewhere. The banter between the team members is as witty as before, with genuinely hilarious ribbing going on between Chiklis and Evans, and the CGI aids rather than overwhelms the various action sequences, which take place from Antarctica to London and China\r\n- a most impressive chase winds around the Great Wall of China at vertigo-inducing pace.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nDoug Jones as the Silver Surfer does an impressive job of being metallic and coldly inhuman, helped in part by an almost unrecognisable voice-over by Laurence Fishburne, and he is more than enough as the film's antagonist. Unfortunately Hollywood fails to learn from its mistakes and insists that more is better, so we are\r\ntreated to the return of Von Doom as foreshadowed at the end of the first film. Appearing first in his traditional metal suit and cloak, a plot contrivance means that Von Doom's ravaged body heals and so\r\nJulian McMahon gets to show his naked face and frankly he is far less menacing for it.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nIn addition to Von Doom being a rubbish villain, other issues follow. The Thing doesn't really get to clobber anyone or anything in the same way as before, and more irritatingly has been reduced to the role of team clown, which is probably the worst bastardisation of the original comic. Ben Grimm was the tragic figure of the team, and thus its emotional core, but here he is the butt of jokes (some of which were admittedly brilliant) and slapstick situations. Let us not dwell too long on the non-existent chemistry between Gruffudd and Alba, but at least Alba gets to look pretty if verging on a Matthew McConnaughy-shade of orange.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIt's not quite in the same league as the big-hitting superhero films, but then it isn't competing on the same level. This is a film that doesn't take itself too seriously and doesn't overstay its welcome with a three-hour running time. There is already a Silver Surfer spin-off planned, which seems faintly premature, but the sequel seems to be doing well enough to justify it in hindsight. Based on other spin-offs that have been inflicted upon the faithful, my only wish is\r\nthat it is less dire than <i>Catwoman</i>. Let's face it, it could hardly be worse. In the meantime, enjoy a film that is pure popcorn.\r\n</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	462	2011-03-26
464	1	16	\N	Shrek the Third	<p>\r\nShrek and his buddies return for a third chapter of mayhem and mischief in this royal tale.\r\n</p><p>\r\nShrek (voice by Mike Myers - Austin Powers) and Fiona (voice by Cameron Diaz - In Her Shoes) are trying to enjoy wedded bliss despite the usual disturbances from Donkey (voice by Eddie Murphy - Dreamgirls) and his fire-blowing dragon/donkey offspring.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBut one day in Far, Far Away Shrek and Fiona are summoned to the royal chambers by the news that King Harold is dying.  In his last words the king passes on his crown to Shrek and Fiona as the next in line for the throne.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe couple decide to give it a shot and don the appropriate royal attire to take their places as the new ogre King and Queen.  However, Shrek's natural ability as a klutz does not make the royal transition go smoothly and disaster strikes as usual.  Instead Shrek decides to renounce his royal title and find the next rightful heir to the throne, Arthur (voice by Justin Timberlake - Alpha Dog).\r\n</p><p>\r\nWith his loyal sidekicks Donkey and Puss in Boots (voice by Antonio Banderas - Take The Lead) in tow. Shrek and the gang set off on a voyage to find Arthur and bring him to Far, Far Away to stand as King.\r\n</p><p>\r\nJust as Shrek departs on his adventure, Fiona drops a bombshell - she is pregnant!  Shrek is hardly father material at the moment and the news begins to make him feel unsettled.  He is haunted by dreams of multiple ogre babies running havoc and crying and pooping all over the place!\r\n</p><p>\r\nEventually the trio arrive at the university town and find Arthur, a skinny unpopular kid, hardly King material.  Nevertheless, Shrek is determined to avoid taking up the royal seat and he sets out to win the heart of the kid and convince him that he is the rightful heir to the throne.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAs always, whenever it comes to affairs of the throne Prince Charming (voice by Rupert Everett - Shrek 2) is never far away.  Determined to become King himself, Charming will do whatever it takes to stop Shrek from ruining his dream.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nCharming teams up with a gang of villainous has-beens to capture Fiona and her friends to lure Shrek and Arthur back to the kingdom.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMyers is fantastic as always as the likeable ogre and he has a particularly entertaining scene when he tries to adopt 'street speak' to relate to Arthur.  Timberlake puts in a good performance as the young unpopular kid and a brief yet funny appearance from Eric Idle (Ella Enchanted) as Merlin adds some extra humour and hippy nonsense to the proceedings.  Praise must also go to Murphy and Banderas who are on top form as always.\r\n</p><p>\r\nShrek The Third is a hilarious family film with jokes aimed at children and adults alike.  With a stellar cast and comedy sketches this movie is a sure-fire hit in an already successful franchise.   \r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	464	2011-03-26
465	1	15	\N	Hostel - Part Two	<p>\r\nThe popularity of violent horror films that revel in the torture of innocents epitomised by the <i>Saw</i> trilogy appears to be finally on the slide. The poor box office performances of recent releases such as <i>The Hills Have Eyes 2</i> and <i>Captivity</i> may finally do more damage to the genre than outraged critics have ever managed. \r\n</p><p>\r\nLooming on screens just as audiences are getting bored is the sequel to perhaps the best film of the grisly bunch, <i>Hostel</i>. Released in 2006 and directed by the controversy courting Eli Roth, the original saw three boisterous backpackers stumble into a charnel house in Eastern Europe where rich businessmen were paying for the privilege to kill. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe sequel's rather unnecessary opening sequence reveals the fate of the only original cast member lucky enough to survive. Unfortunately Paxton (Jay Hernandez - Torque), now back home in America, turns out not to be that lucky after all. This prologue to the main plot merely provides the obligatory bloody opening scene to remind audiences that they are in fact watching a horror film and haven't wandered in unexpectedly on an animated comedy from Pixar. The fact that this prologue falls so flat is perhaps explained by the woeful characterisation that hindered the first film. \r\n</p><p>\r\nEach of the three main friends were so overwhelmingly unpleasant that it was almost impossible to root for their survival at the time, let alone care about their fate more than a year later. Thankfully this problem has been addressed and the new characters do actually have distinct personalities that aren't immediately repulsive. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIn a revolutionary development the three boys of the original have been replaced by a cast of three girls. Beth, Lorna and Whitney are also on a backpacking tour across Europe but instead of easy sex these young ladies are hoping for a relaxing stay at a spa in Slovakia. An improbably leggy Eastern European model offers to guide them to a pleasant hostel while occasionally throwing theatrically devilish looks to the camera. The girls soon find themselves in seemingly benign Slovakia, a country apparently populated by stern hairy men, grubby street urchins and only gorgeous women. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSwiftly, however, the travellers are spirited away to crumbling torture chambers set up in the bowels of an abandoned factory. Much of the original's unsuccessful quirky humour has been pruned away making this bigger budget sequel a slicker, more professional affair. The film's best addition is a subplot which sees two American men, one nervous and the other eager, bid at an internet auction to murder the protagonists. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe story follows the two groups' simultaneous journeys until torturer finally meets victim face to face over a selection of rusty power tools. Despite the criticism that is often levelled at him, director Eli Roth once again proves himself to be a genuinely talented filmmaker and not simply a purveyor of cheap shocks. He creates several memorable scenes including an eerie sequence amid the steam at an outdoor spa. \r\n</p><p>\r\nHis greatest achievement, however, comes during the film's climatic moments by which time he has humanised his killers to such an extent that the audience must be questioning with whom the filmmaker's sympathies actually lie. \r\n</p><p>\r\nEven though Hostel 2 is executed in some style and, despite being superior to its predecessor in every way, it offers precious little that is actually original. It's worth watching if you can stomach its excesses but with luck Roth will now move on to better things and this sub genre of horror will be put out of its lingering misery before this critic has to sit through <i>Saw IV</i>.\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	465	2011-03-26
466	1	20	\N	Die Hard 4.0	<p>\r\nAn ambitious nasty terrorist, Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant - Catch and Release), has come up with a great plan to bring America to its knees and also make some money at the same time. \r\n</p><p>\r\nUsing a small army of geeks to develop the computer code he needs, a stylish but unhinged ex-IT professional can essentially hack into all the government systems and cause a massive nationwide system crash. While the USA goes into meltdown, said maniac can move freely and play different government departments off each other while stealing all the information he or his hackers ever need.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe well dressed villain with a hot ninja girlfriend Mai (Maggie Q - MI3) has factored in every response from the government, the CIA and the FBI. He has meticulously planned every facet of their multi stage plan but being an evil genius he forgot one small rogue element, Detective John McClane (Bruce Willis - Sin City).\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter securing all the computer code he needs, Gabriel sends his mercenaries to bump off all the nerds he hired so that nobody can unravel his little plan. Unfortunately the FBI has got wind of some possible IT hackers and has dispatched local police to round them up.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOne such little nerd, Matt (Justin Long - Accepted), happens to be working late and doesn't manage to detonate the slabs of C4 explosive that the baddies kindly strapped under his desk. Before Matt gets a chance to barbecue himself, Detective McClane arrives to take him into protective custody. Realising that the explosive option hasn't worked, the nimble mercenaries instead try the traditional shoot 'em up method and storm the flat. Good old John McClane saves the nerd in a fantastic early action sequence. The key word in that sentence is 'old', McClane is getting old but that doesn't mean he's getting soft.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWhat follows is the slow disintegration of the USA as Gabriel puts his plan into action and essentially hijacks the entire country. With one nerd and a lot of determination, McClane takes on the task of tracking down the seemingly untraceable Gabriel and you can be sure that there will be many an action sequence along the way.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIt has been 12 years since the last Die Hard movie (Die Hard with a Vengeance) and the format still works even if it is unchanged. This is both a strength and a weakness. In the movie's favour it has a very good idea (albeit far fetched) in the threat of technological terrorism and it explores the realities of the electronic age even if it gets farcical (very real). The action sequences are impressive especially in the first half of the movie and the build up and initial attacks by Gabriel are well presented and engaging. Sadly, halfway through the film sort of loses its way and tries to compensate by pushing things too far.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMore than any of its predecessors this Die Hard has some CGI explosions and blue screen action sequences. In particular there is a woefully exaggerated action sequence involving a harrier jet that is reminiscent of the absurd ending in "True Lies". The movie also breaks a cardinal rule of Die Hard movies by casting an American as a villain rather than a polite Brit. Ask a hundred action fans which of the three Die Hard movies was weakest and ninety nine of them will say Die Harder; the one with an American actor playing the villain. Coincidence? I think not! I feel these regrettable excesses weaken what was otherwise a great action movie.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAs Detective McClane, voted one of the best movie cops of all time, Willis is so comfortable it isn't long before we have all forgotten how much he has aged and are fully enjoying his sarcastic attacks and relentless fisticuffs with henchmen at least twenty years his junior. Joining the movie as the latest sidekick, Long provides his own comedy element and also emphasises the age gap between the cop and the crook as his conversation often leaves McClane in the dark depths of confusion. Long has been in many a comedy but this is his first step into the blockbuster world of action movies and he makes the transition well. \r\n</p><p>\r\nMeanwhile Olyphant, who has slowly been appearing in more and more movies, gets his first big role as the latest villain. Sadly Olyphant never really feels as threatening as his predecessors even if he does rack up quite a body count. This is not necessarily his fault, he is American. Nothing against Americans but they rarely come across as threatening as European thespians such as Alan Rickman or Jeremy Irons.\r\n</p><p>\r\nGo see it, enjoy it, laugh along with the jokes and cringe with the suckerpunches. This is a good dependable action movie that makes a nice change from Lycra clad superheroes or suited and booted secret agents. Popcorn action at its best.\r\n</p><p>\r\nI rank this above <i>Die Hard 2</i> (1 star) but behind <i>Die Hard</i> (4 stars) and <i>Die Hard with a Vengeance</i> (4 stars) . So although it's the fourth film it isn't fourth place. \r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	466	2011-03-26
426	1	12	Blah	Hot Fuzz	<p>When top Met officer Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg - <i>Shaun Of The Dead</i>) starts making his colleagues look slack, he is promoted to sergeant and banished to Sandford in Gloucestershire. Partnered with Danny Butterman (Nick Frost - <i>Shaun Of The Dead</i>), he realises that life in Sandford is rather quieter than in London, where the Neighbourhood Watch Alliance's only concerns are the prevalence of hoodie-wearing youths on the streets and the occasional unwanted street performer. However, for a town with no crime, people seem to keep dying in mysterious accidents. Angel is soon on the case and his  investigation leads him to the manager of the local supermarket, Simon Skinner (Timothy Dalton - <i>The Living Daylights</i>), but the truth turns out to be far simpler than his elaborately determined motive. Gunplay ensues.</p>\r\n<p>Referencing more action films than even a hardcore fan could be expected to recognise, Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg have once again taken an established genre and subverted it. Setting a buddy-cop action film in rural England was a stroke of genius, except for the minor problem that for two thirds of the film nothing remotely action-worthy takes place. This might sound bad, but things are kept moving by the situation comedy of the straitlaced Angel getting to grips with rural life, and his eager, yet hopelessly naive new partner. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>Both Pegg and Frost are excellent in their respective roles, Pegg this time playing the straight man, but again with that homoerotic tension between the two seen in both <i>Shaun Of The Dead</i> and Wright and Pegg's TV series <i>Spaced</i>. This could simply be another reference to <i>Point Break</i>, but it is now a recurring theme that is starting to look faintly odd with each new production.</p>\r\n<p>Speaking about references, it's fun to spot them even if most will go sailing by. This won't diminish enjoyment of the film, but it does mean that it's difficult to see exactly what Wright contributed to the film in the way of direction not blatantly stolen from elsewhere. There's the explicitly foreshadowed <i>Point Blank</i> scene, some less overt but obvious <i>Bad Boys 2</i> plagiarism (one of the last action films that I expected to be referenced), plus, well, any one of John Woo's Hong Kong era output, but all of these and more are in such a gloriously over-the-top finale it's hard to complain.</p>\r\n<p>The sophomore effort is always a tricky one, since one has to prove that the first success wasn't a fluke while at the same time doing something different. <i>Hot Fuzz</i> does well to achieve this feat, and promises much for the dynamic duo of Wright and Pegg. 'By the power of Greyskull!'indeed.</p>\r\n	5	2011-03-26	426	2012-03-08
467	1	20	It's better than the book at any rate	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix	<p><b><i>A quick recap of the franchise.</b></i></p>\r\n\r\n"Hello this is child line, how can I help?"<br>\r\n"Hi, my name is Harry and it's all so unfair."<br>\r\n"Oh there, there. You sound so unhappy. What seems to be the problem?<br>\r\n"My parents were killed by a maniac when I was a tot and every year he comes back to try and kill me again. Last year he came back from near death and killed my friend."<br>\r\n"Well that's awful, did you tell the police?"<br>\r\n"No, also the only person I can turn to is a convicted mass murderer who is on the run and my two best friends who don't even write to me anymore."<br>\r\n"Well you do seem to be in the doldrums, maybe a nice cup of tea and a few verses of kum bay yah might cheer you up"<br>\r\n"Are you kidding me! Two dementors have just tried to suck out my soul, the media is calling me a delusional homicidal maniac and now I think I am being possessed."<br>\r\n"Kum bay yah my lord, kum bay yah"<br>\r\n"It's soooo unfair"<br>\r\n"Kum bay yah my lord, kum bay yah"<br>\r\n"Are you even listening?"<br>\r\n"Of course I am, you're Harry Potter."<br>\r\n"So can you offer any advice?"<br>\r\n"No"<br>\r\n"Why not"<br>\r\n"Dumbledore told us not to."<br></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is basically a quick recap for anyone who has been living in a sound proof box at the bottom of a deep cave. Every Harry Potter book gets more mature and every Harry Potter movie gets darker than its predecessor. The recently released 'Order of the Phoenix" continues this trend and is yet another great addition to the franchise.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn this latest instalment Harry is attacked in sleepy Surrey and gets dragged into the ministry of magic for using magic to defend himself. It transpires that while Harry has been out of the loop the Ministry of Magic has been using the media to debunk Harry and Dumbledore's claims that Lord Voldemort has returned.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWhen Harry gets back to school he soon realises he is as popular as a cowpat sandwich and that the new ministry appointed dark arts teacher, Professor Umbridge, has a serious case of megalomania. His mind is being invaded by Voldemort and the link between Harry and his nemeses makes him question himself and all those around him. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDirector David Yates is best know for his political thriller series 'State of Play' and in this movie he brings a more mature element of characterisation to the HP franchise. The world of magic forms a backdrop to the drama and the emphasis is very much on Harry's feelings and his relationships as his mind crumbles. Thankfully Yates also manages to get the best acting yet from his teenage cast and the movie stands up well when compared to its predecessors. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe action sequences and set pieces are very true to the book and the feel of the movie remains gritty and dark yet also as fantastic as expected for a fantasy movie. There has been quite a bit of pruning to get the X page story into a single movie and many book fans may lament the loss of certain crucial scenes. The loss of these subplots does often leave poorly patched holes but on speaking with a non-reader HP fan, these are not too noticeable. The film itself stands up well but on weak legs if you have read the book. \r\n</p><p>\r\nOn the acting front a big nod to newcomer Evanna Lynch who is fantastic as Luna 'Looney' Lovegood, a distant dreamy girl with occasional lucid moments of brilliance and Imelda Staunton as the ever cheerful, yet nasty as sin, Delores Umbridge.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSo after a year and half wait I've finally seen HP5 and can report it is a good addition to the series and one of the strongest of the movies yet. The acting is top notch, the story is well paced and the setting is suitably menacing. The emotional wallop may not hit as hard but it is a good foundation for chapter six due out in 2008.  \r\n</p><p>\r\n</p><p>\r\n</p><p>\r\n<< <b><i>Scroll down for mild rant and some spoilers</b></i> >>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Fans of the book may need to have patience with this movie as many a story thread gets a bit mangled in this movie. Delores is faithfully portrayed but her involvement in certain earlier scenes is never confirmed while the importance of the prophecy is a little diluted in the movie compared with the book portraying Dumbledore more as an onlooker than an architect. I suspect that this is meant to add an element of wisdom to Harry over his headmaster but ultimately may clash when we get into the next movie. Then again they'll probably gloss over it quite easily.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFew questions for those who have seen the movie:\r\n</p><p>\r\n1.\tWho sent the dementors to attack Harry?<br>\r\n2.\tHow do Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Neville manage to fly the Thestrals if they can't see them?<br>\r\n3.\tWho replaces Trelawney?<br>\r\n4.\tWhen Harry hears the prophecy, whose voice does he hear?<br>\r\n5.\tWhat happened to the death eaters?<br>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	467	2012-03-08
479	1	15	\N	Captivity	<p>\r\nIn a rather uncharacteristic defence of moral standards the Motion Picture Association of America recently banned the poster campaign for torture porn flick Captivity in the United States because the adverts featured star Elisha Cuthbert (House of Wax) being restrained, tortured and finally murdered. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAmid all the sermonising its release date has been repeatedly put back and as a result UK audiences now have the chance to see this movie before our transatlantic cousins. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAll this negative publicity and hype will no doubt reward Captivity with an over inflated box office return in America, proving again that there is no such thing as bad publicity. Those in search of an extreme experience that breaks the limits of taste and decency, however, will be sorely disappointed, several gorier and seedier horror films have slipped past the censors unimpeded. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWorst of all, the film is not just short of shocks, it's also complete utter rubbish. Jennifer (Cuthbert) is a successful model / actress who doesn't display even a hint of personality before she is drugged and kidnapped within five minutes of the film starting. \r\n</p><p>\r\nShe wakes to find herself in a plushly decorated cell that has been stocked with nothing more threatening than an extensive wardrobe of designer outfits. Her abductor observes her every action via cameras and periodically storms into the room to drug her and then threaten her with horrible death. \r\n</p><p>\r\nMuch of Jennifer's time is spent wailing and begging and getting testy. Occasionally candid interviews from before her kidnap are played revealing her to be such a dull heroine that it becomes completely inconsequential as to whether she lives or dies. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThankfully something approaching a plot eventually begins to develop when Jennifer discovers she isn't the only person being held. Dashingly handsome Gary (Daniel Gillies - Spider-Man 2) is on the other side of a glass screen to provide moral support during this difficult situation. Eventually they get in the same cell together at which point Jennifer tosses all caution to the wind and shags Gary. \r\n</p><p>\r\nConsidering the kidnapper watches her every move on video monitors and repeatedly walks in to her cell fully armed you might have thought she would have some sense of restraint and maybe a little bit of decorum? \r\n</p><p>\r\nAnyway the film fumbles along to its inevitable and painfully obvious plot twist after which Jennifer gets to exact her revenge but makes such a painful hash of it you wonder how anyone could be so stupid? Captivity is torturous in every respect except the way in which it was intended.\r\n</p>	1	2011-03-26	479	2011-03-26

511	1	20	\N	30 Days of Night	<p>\r\nVampires are the most stylish of the classic monsters due largely to the over powering effect of Count Dracula, source material for most bloodsucker stories. There have been countless vampire movies over the years (152 for Dracula himself) and recently we have seen some greats (such as Blade), some not so great (Underworld) and some down-right awful (Dracula 2000).\r\n</p><p>\r\nYep, the vampire movie has had more revamps (pardon the pun) than Madonna and often has acting almost as bad as the pop diva herself. To make a truly memorable vampire film these days you need to offer something new. <i>30 Days of Night</i> manages to stick in the mind thanks to some rather nasty scenes and an intelligent take on the villains themselves. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe story itself, a group of people being picked off one by one, isn't the most original but it is played out with a good script, some action and oodles of blood. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSet in a small remote Alaskan town, the plot follows the town sheriff Eben (Josh Hartnett - The Black Dahlia) as he prepares the town folk for the eponymous <i>30 days of night</i>. As the citizens stock up on baked beans and warm socks, Eben follows a mysterious series of minor events including the destruction of mobile phones and the slaying of the local huskies. Meanwhile on the outskirts of town Eben's estranged wife, Stella (Melissa George - Paradise Lost) misses her flight to sunlight and returns reluctantly to town.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAs the last day of light fails Eben's investigations lead him to a mysterious stranger who forebodes death, and Stella, the source of the human drama any horror needs.\r\n</p><p>\r\nNight falls and then the attacks begin. The power is knocked out leaving people in darkness and then the phone lines are cut leaving the town completely cut off. Now the baddies can attack and this is when things get good.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe vampires are dressed contrary to the weather in thin suits and jackets, while their faces are distorted and their teeth needle like. Through tidbits of subtitled information we learn that these vampires have lived for centuries and that they survive by culling the weak and leaving no survivors of their attacks. They are as intelligent as they are ruthless and they enjoy the hunt. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSpanning the 30 days of darkness and bad weather we watch as the remaining survivors try to wait out the night and escape the hell that has descended on their town.  The savagery of the attacks is quite graphic for a 15 and the filming style is gritty using bleached sets and a mainly black night or white snow canvas livened up only by the impressive quantities of blood.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThis movie isn't horror excellence, the human interest is particularly weak, but the nastiness of these particular vampires adds gravitas to an otherwise clich plot. The stylising and the unexpected, and in one instance hilarious, death scenes keep things moving along and make for a great piece of blood soaked entertainment.\r\n</p><p>\r\nNo need to dwell on the acting in this movie as for the most part it was as wooden as the absent 'stakes' that often frequent such proceedings. However praise must be bestowed on Danny Huston (The Kingdom) who is particularly nasty as Marlow, the head bastard bloodsucker.\r\n</p><p>\r\nI strongly recommend this movie to fans of the <I>Saw</i> and <i>Hostel</i> movies as well as fans of <i>Blade</i>, <i>28 Weeks Later</i>, and <I>Assault on Precinct 13</I>. \r\n	4	2011-03-26	511	2011-03-26
468	1	16	\N	Hairspray	<p>\r\nSchoolgirl Tracy (newcomer Nikki Blonsky) dreams of becoming a dance star on the Corny Collins TV show.  She spends most evenings dancing in front of the box with her best friend Penny (Amanda Bynes - She's The Man).\r\n</p><p>\r\nCorny Collins and his regular team of dancers are led by Amber (Brittany Snow - John Tucker Must Die) and her boyfriend Link (Zac Efron - High School Musical).  Conveniently Amber's mother Velma (Michelle Pfeiffer - Grease 2) is the TV channel's station manager so Amber is always guaranteed to have a spot in front of the camera.\r\n</p><p>\r\nTracy spends most of her time at school daydreaming about Link and yearning to be part of the Corny Collins dance team.  Her lack of attention and taunts by Amber mean she ends up in detention most days.  Here she has the perfect opportunity to pick up some new dance moves and groove away with some of the hottest dancers in town.  Seaweed (Elijah Kelley - Take The Lead) and his gang are regulars on the show's 'negro day' presented by Seaweed's mother Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah - Chicago).\r\n</p><p>\r\nOne day an unexpected opportunity arises and Tracy has the chance to audition for a spot on the Corny Collins show.  Despite her mother's reservations, Tracy takes a shot at fame on the small screen.  Unfortunately Tracy can't quite match up to the stick thin image of the regular dancers and she is laughed out of the building by Amber and her mother.\r\n</p><p>\r\nLuckily for Tracy, Link has spotted her potential and Corny Collins (James Marsden - Superman Returns) also agrees that Tracy has an impressive talent.  Soon Tracy's mother (John Travolta - Grease) and Christopher Walken (Pennies From Heaven) are seeing their little girl dancing on the TV.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBut fame and popularity comes with a price and Amber's jealousy turns to conspiracy as Velma does everything in her power to push Tracy out of the limelight in order to guarantee Amber's success at the Miss Teenage Hairspray contest.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAn all-star cast, led by newcomer Blonsky, offers some excellent acting, singing and dancing performances.  Blonsky is such a likeable character and delivers some good dance moves and vocals. Travolta is funny and loveable as the ample-breasted Edna even managing some impressive dance moves despite the extra weight he is carrying.  Walken's character is more subdued and nave making a nice balance of personalities between the two.   Other great musical and dance performances come from Queen Latifah and Kelley.  Marsden and Efron are also suitably cast as the slick and cheesy dancers with smooth hairstyles and immaculate shiny teeth.  Keep an eye out for a cameo from the original Tracy, Ricki Lake (Cry Baby).\r\n</p><p>\r\nHairspray is a fun-filled comedy with great singing and dancing.  The tunes are contagious, the acting is superb and the story is pure entertainment.  Fans of <i>Grease</i> and <i>Dirty Dancing</i> are sure to enjoy this modern remake of the 1988 original.  It will have you dancing and singing along in the aisles!\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	468	2011-03-26
469	1	20	\N	The Simpsons Movie	<p>\r\nThe Simpsons television show has become a worldwide phenomena showing in almost every country. It is an inescapable show that I imagine is always showing on at least one channel at any given time. This bombardment of yellow pigmented animation begs the question, why make a movie?\r\n</p><p>\r\nThere are so many episodes and so many characters in the world of The Simpsons that many true fans are beginning to tire of reruns and the new shows are somehow less hilarious than their predecessors. Is 'The Simpsons' franchise running out of steam, is this movie the last gasp of a dying megafranchise?\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe movie, like the show, concentrates on the everyday madcap adventures of the Simpson family. After a particular tragic concert at the heavily polluted Springfield lake, Lisa Simpson feels compelled to act by petitioning the government. As she canvasses the streets of Springfield she meets a fellow activist and falls giddy in love. Meanwhile Homer and Bart are having father son issues after Homer adopts a pig and fails to defend Bart when a game of dare gets out of hand. Homer seemingly cares for his new pet pig more than his son and Bart is forced to concede that do-gooder neighbour Flanders may in fact be a better dad. Back at home Marge is consumed with worry after Grandpa had a momentary spasm in church and prophesised the destruction of Springfield.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nThese small stories soon merge when Homer inadvertently causes an ecological disaster and a reactionary president decides it'd be better if the city of Springfield were to disappear. Chased by an angry mob Homer does the only thing he knows and leads the family into hiding but soon things go awry and Homer is forced to confront his responsibilities and so heads back to Springfield to save the day.\r\n</p><p>\r\nPacked with the well known mix of physical, sarcastic and satirical humour we have become accustomed to plus the usual number of movie references this is a good family movie. Essentially a protracted episode, it may fall short of some people's expectations but what do those people expect when the show already tries so much?\r\n</p>	2	2011-03-26	469	2011-03-26
470	1	15	\N	Transformers	<p>\r\nA film based on a 1980's cartoon based on a toy line should never have been this good, but thanks to a healthy dose of childhood nostalgia, an enormous budget and plenty of thrills Transformers is the best brainless movie of the summer. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf - Bobby) is a typical teenager dealing with typical teenage problems. He is struggling to raise the money to buy his first car and he is unable to get the attention of Mikaela (Megan Fox - Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen), the hottest girl in school. All his troubles, however, are put into perspective when his ramshackle yellow Camaro transforms into a gigantic alien robot who wants him to help find a lost artefact that, in the wrong hands, could lay waste to all of mankind. \r\n</p><p>\r\nClearly Transformers is not a complex film but for it to succeed it did have to deliver for fans some truly astonishing fights scenes, which, after all, is what everyone has come to see. Thankfully special effects house Industrial Light and Magic are on excellent form. The robot transformations between their various guises are particularly well executed and they interact with their real world surroundings flawlessly. Much of that interaction is the Transformers demolition of buildings and other vehicles. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe big finale provides this blockbuster season with its most extraordinary action sequence as the Autobots and Decepticons go toe to toe in downtown Los Angeles. The mayhem the giant robots wreak is impressively wide both on land, as a villainous tank trades volleys with both human soldiers and the Autobots alike, and in the air where a Decepticon dogfights with F22 Raptors. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAt times director Michael Bay, as he has in his previous action films, takes us too close to the heart of the action often making fight scenes disorientating and difficult to keep up with. In his other films, however, he has also often dispensed with detailed characterisation and plot in order to get to the next explosion but here he has largely restrained himself, or been restrained by executive producer Steven Spielberg whose influence is often clear. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAlthough everyone watching the film obviously wants to see fifty foot tall robots knock dents into each other, the principal actors involved deserve a mention since, rather commendably, they hold their own against a tide of special effects. Star of the show Shia LaBeouf has been hailed as Hollywood's latest hot ticket, tomorrows Tom Hanks and Harrison Ford's future co-star in next summer's fourth Indiana Jones adventure. I for one couldn't see quite what the fuss is all about. He isn't especially handsome, his chatterbox delivery of dialogue is irritating and cocky Sam is difficult to like. \r\n</p><p>\r\nLove interest Megan Fox meanwhile is so eye wateringly attractive that I feared for my eyesight every time she writhed onto the screen. I have absolutely no idea whether she can act in the slightest but if you're male (and watching a film like Transformers probably means that you are) you probably won't care either. \r\n</p><p>\r\nMaking up cast are the US Rangers who first encounter the trigger happy Decepticons amid the sand dunes of Qatar. They are led by Josh Duhamal and Tyrese Gibson but their roles boil down to little more than pointing at monolithic robots, running away from said robots and occasionally stopping to fire back to little effect, all the while managing to look good with designer dirt smeared across their brows. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAt times logic completely deserts the film although I doubt many in the audience cared. I did wonder why when trying to escape the pursuing villains the army decided to make a fight in the most populated place they can find instead of making their stand in the desert? Someone offers an explanation along the lines of hiding from the baddies will be easier to do in the city but I couldn't help but fret about all the unnecessary civilian casualties that would have been prevented if only they had used their brains. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAlso very distracting but for a different reason is the subplot set in the Pentagon following the lead computer geek who cracks the Decepticons' communication code. Surprisingly Maggie (Rachael Taylor) isn't a social misfit riddled with acne but a blond Australian stunner who makes Elle McPherson look like Treebeard from Lord of the Rings. At least you can't accuse the filmmakers of stereotyping nerds but the scenes did slow down the main plot and I was sceptical every time her character uttered a stream of techno babble. \r\n</p><p>\r\nClearly Transformers isn't flawless but it is a lot of fun. Besides I was willing to forgive it a multitude of sins the moment the blue truck of Optimus Prime rolled up engine rumbling and original voice actor Peter Cullen gave the command, "Autobots, roll out!"\r\n</p>	4	2011-03-26	470	2011-03-26
471	1	16	\N	Evan Almighty	<p>\r\nEvan Baxter (Steve Carell - The 40 Year Old Virgin) is no longer an ordinary man.  He has just been appointed as a senator and with this new responsibility comes a huge mansion, brand spanking new set of wheels and a new lifestyle.\r\n</p><p>\r\nEvan's wife and children are upset at having to leave behind their hometown and friends but are supportive of their patriarch and their sorrow soon disappears when the family sets eyes on their new lavish home.\r\n</p><p>\r\nEvan is even having the same kind of luck at the office.  With his new position he gets a bigger office!  Who would have thought that being neighbours with Congressman Long (John Goodman - Cars) would reap such benefits?  Evan's assistant Rita and colleagues are certainly not complaining about their new office environment and quickly align themselves with their new benefactor.\r\n</p><p>\r\nLife is just perfect for the Baxter family and Evan couldn't ask for more. Soon their happy existence is disturbed by numerous unwanted deliveries of tools and wood.  Evan is confused until he has a visit from God himself (Morgan Freeman - Lucky Number Slevin) who sets him a huge task.  Evan must build an ark to prepare the town for a devastating flood.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWith numerous reservations, Evan refuses to take his orders and decides to carry on with his life as normal.  As a punishment God does everything in his power to torment and ridicule Evan until he devotes himself to the monumental task. \r\n</p><p>\r\nOnce Evan starts to build his ark, nothing and no-one will stop him and he must complete it before his given deadline.  He carries on despite rejection from his family and his peers. Will Evan finish his ark in time? Will there really be a flood during one of the hottest summers on record? Why is congressman Long so over friendly? And more importantly, will he be ostracised by the local community and branded a freak?\r\n</p><p>\r\nCarell puts in a good performance as a contemporary Noah but it is not a patch on his rib-tickling role in <i>The 40 Year Old Virgin</i>.  Freeman is cheeky and mischievous as God and there is excellent comedic support from Wanda Sykes (Barnyard) as Evan's feisty personal assistant Rita.\r\n</p><p>\r\n<i>Evan Almighty</i> is a much more child friendly and toned down version of <i>Bruce Almighty</i>. The gags are still funny and thankfully do not retread the same ground as <i>Bruce Almighty</i> but the story is still as thin as a Barbie doll's legs. Considering the potential for environmental messages about conservation and deforestation this film played it just a bit too safe. Then again if you consider an environmental message centring on a saviour constructing a gigantic ark out of innocent trees as a bit of a paradox that's probably understandable.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nIt's a good movie for children and young teens and if you enjoy films such as <i>Ace Ventura</i> and <i>Dr Dolittle</i> you will probably love this movie.  Evan Almighty is a feel good, laid back movie that will guarantee a few laughs but may be the end of this small franchise.\r\n</p>	2	2011-03-26	471	2011-03-26
472	1	16	\N	Rush Hour 3	<p>\r\nThe comedy crime-fighting duo Carter (Chris Tucker - Rush Hour 2) and Lee (Jackie Chan - Rush Hour 2) are back on our screens to tackle a new adventure in Paris.\r\n</p><p>\r\nDuring their adventure in the first movie, the duo were entrusted by the Chinese ambadassor Han (Tzi Ma -\r\n24 [TV]) to keep his daughter Soo Yung safe.  The tables have turned and now the grown up Soo Young is begging Carter and Lee to keep her father alive when an evil gang of Triads attempt to assassinate him.\r\n</p><p>\r\nCarter and Lee are reunited, six years since the last film, and this time take a trip to Paris to follow the Triad trail and locate the head honcho of the mysterious criminal underworld.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAs usual, the duo face endless obstacles including a frisking by immigration (Roman Polanksi - director of <I>chinatown</i>), an American bashing cabbie called George (Yvan Attal - Munich) and an obscenely tall Asian dude.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAs in all the Rush Hour films, there is a principal baddie who is determined to wipe out our heroes and of course shares a history with one of team, as well as mysterious secretive crime lord who will reveal themselves toward the end (not literally thank god). Another must is of course the beautiful love interest, this time in the guise of an informant called Genevieve (Noemie Lenoir - After The Sunset) who makes Carter go weak at the knees.  She holds a dark and precious secret that the criminals want to destroy.\r\n</p><p>\r\nTucker and Chan are on top form for the third time running as the black and asian comedy duo making numerous jokes at the other's expense.  Don't miss the array of fantastic one-liners and hilarious jokes that are the trademark of the Rush Hour franchise. Expect laughs a minute, fantastic stunts and fight scenes and an great chemistry between the two leads.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIt's very rare to say it but this movie tops off a fantastic trilogy.  Well done boys!  Fans of the Rush Hour movies and Starsky & Hutch are sure to love this comedy escapade.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n	4	2011-03-26	472	2011-03-26
473	1	20	\N	The Bourne Ultimatum	<p>\r\nThe latest 'Jason Bourne' movie arrives and once again breaks the rule that sequels are never as good as their predecessors. Packed with chases, violence and edge of your seat action, Bourne's latest, and possible last, adventure is simply fantastic.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFound adrift in the Mediterranean sea an amnesiac Jason Bourne slowly started to piece together his identity in the aptly named, <i>The Bourne Identity</i>, with the assistance of a supportive free spirit Marie. After confronting his former employer and delivering a clear warning not to interfere, Bourne and Marie went into hiding. Sadly in <i>The Bourne Supremacy</i> an unscrupulous Russian tycoon scuppered Bourne's dreams of peaceful retirement when he killed a CIA informant and framed Bourne for the murder. The same Russian also got his puppet killer to try and dispose of Bourne but he missed and instead killed Marie. \r\n</p><p>\r\nLesson one from the school for suicidal stupidity; if you ever want to piss off a retired mentally unstable assassin, knock off his only source of happiness and emotional support.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAt the end of <i>The Bourne Supremacy</i>, Bourne has avenged Marie and exposed the corruption that dragged him from peaceful solitude. <i>The Bourne Ultimatum</i> follows on seamlessly and we meet Bourne as he decides that to truly be free he must confront those who made him who he is but to do that he must first learn the truth about his past.\r\n</p><p>\r\nConveniently a keen journalist for the Guardian, Simon (Paddy Considine - Hot Fuzz), has made contact with a secretive CIA snitch who has divulged details of Bourne's past. Writing some strong articles that may topple certain CIA megalomaniacs, Simon soon becomes a target for the so called 'good guys' at the CIA. Fortunately Bourne has been avidly reading the articles and intercepts Simon just as the wolves close in for the kill.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWith a few scant details to go on Bourne starts to track down the elusive CIA snitch with the evil elements of that organisation hot on his heels. With few friends and little information Bourne is in a race to find both the truth and redemption before the mighty CIA catch up with him.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe Bourne Identity was a 'small' film by public perception as it didn't boast any huge stars and was released in the sleepy autumn of 2002 that didn't offer much to the movie fan (The Adventures of Pluto Nash, for example). It opened fairly quietly but soon gained a massive fan base. The slow burning but intelligent plot mixed with a strong element of realism (except for one or two scenes in the final five minutes) and the ferocity of the action was a winning cocktail. No cackling evil geniuses, no madcap plots for world domination and no guns with endless bullets; I remember thinking "this is how Bond should be". \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe sequel continued to up the pace as it no longer needed the lengthy "who am I" fumbling that slowed down the first half of <i>The Bourne Identity. The Bourne Supremacy</i> was a little dumber plot-wise but was still rollicking good fun and had even more action. Now we have the final (possibly not) instalment and it caps things off brilliantly.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWith little dialogue and little redeeming wit, it may be surprising that the cold killer Bourne is so popular but the realism and the sheer brutality of his actions make him more 'real' than any of his rival action heroes. Echoing that sentiment it seems Bond has shed some gadgets and lunacy to focus more on plot and conviction. Has Bourne saved Bond? \r\n</p><p>\r\nTo bring such a strong but silent character to screen and earn that kinda cred needs a good actor. Matt Damon embodies the role of Jason Bourne and emanates a very cold and menacing character on screen that is a far cry from his neurotic Ocean's 11 character, or even his renegade Angel of Death in Dogma. In recent interviews Damon has rejected the idea of returning for more Bourne films. This may be a marketing tactic to boost his already lofty salary but if true this is a good movie to end on.\r\n</p><p>\r\nNew to the movie and adding high acting clout David Strathairn (Good Night, Good Luck) joins the CIA baddie list as deputy director Noah Vosen who has his own merry band of murderers who want to do away with Bourne and Albert Finney (Ocean's 12) as...\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn support Julia Stiles returns as Nicky and this time gets to play a more pivotal role filling in for Bourne's female psychological support following the demise of Marie in The Bourne Supremacy. Nicky's character, only a cameo in the two prequels, has some big decisions to make in this movie and Stiles regains some credibility following the abysmal "The Omen" remake last year. Also returning is Joan Allen (The Upside of Anger) as Pamela Landy, the CIA lady who won our trust in The Bourne Supremacy but like Nicky finds that politics are leading her astray. \r\n</p><p>\r\nEnough review now, tired of typing, I obviously liked the film and you are getting the hint. Go see it and I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did and those loud and enthusiastic press peeps who cheered for more as the now familiar Moby track "Extreme Ways" signalled the end credits.\r\n</p>	5	2011-03-26	473	2011-03-26
474	1	15	\N	Paradise Lost	<p>\r\nSometimes it feels like Hollywood is trying to tell you something. After watching Paradise Lost and being well aware that Eli Roth's Hostel 2 is only a few short weeks away from release it seems that the studios message this summer is stay at home. Don't even consider getting on that flight to sunnier climates because the natives are waiting and they are out to get you. Perhaps you would be safer spending your time, and your money, at the local multiplex instead? \r\n</p><p>\r\nParadise Lost follows a group of white, western tourists around the backpacking trail in Brazil where they are assaulted, murdered and harvested for their organs. All the sort of things you wouldn't expect if you've just booked two weeks in a static caravan on the Isle of Wight. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe western tourists are a cosmopolitan group. There are three physically flawless Americans, a pretentious hippy Australian (Melissa George - The Amityville Horror), two annoying geezer Brits and two Swedes who are swiftly consigned to the category of dead meat. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe tourist's loco coach driver feels comfortable taking hairpin turns at close to warp speed while halfway up a mountain and before you can say 'unattended goat herd' the bus is taking the quick route down a precipice. \r\n</p><p>\r\nStranded in rural Brazil near a beach hut paradise that quickly turns sour, the gang flee to a jungle refuge run by a glum doctor whose policy on international fair trade include kidneys and livers. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDespite the subject matter and marketing, the film doesn't develop into a standard horror. No one goes off for a wander, alone, at night, to investigate a mysteriously deserted building or strange noise in the jungle. Nor do any characters pop up out of nowhere during tense moments accompanied by a full philharmonic orchestra. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWith all the obvious scare generating conventions of the genre missing, Paradise Lost turns out to be a reasonably enjoyable thriller. Just because the film isn't frightening, however, doesn't mean it isn't bloody. One character is essentially hollowed out for her organs and someone else is stabbed in the eye with a meat skewer. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe filmmakers, however, don't revel in the gore unlike the similarly plotted Hostel, which wallows in its numerous torture scenes. Paradise Lost never sinks to that level although consequently, by playing it safe, it won't share Hostel's level of notoriety or linger as long in the memory. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhile the film lacks originality and won't win itself any friends at the Brazilian tourist board it does have a standout chase sequence set among some beautifully filmed underwater caverns to recommend itself to the undemanding viewer. It also has the best looking bikini clad cast since Jessica Alba made me forget whether Into the Blue even had a plot?\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	474	2011-03-26
476	1	1	\N	Waitress	<p>\r\nAdrienne Shelly's final film, The Waitress, is a romantic comedy based in the deep South and centres on a talented pie-making waitress (Keri Russell - Mission Impossible 3) who is down on her luck and unhappy with her lot.  Her husband is the main cause for disappointment in her life, he is particularly abhorrent, manipulative and needy, and is excellently played by Jeremy Sisto  (Thirteen).\r\n</p><p>\r\nJenna (Russell) works with her 2 best (and only) friends in the diner. Shelly plays Dawn, a shy small town girl who is just looking for love and is willing to go on 5 minute dates to try and find her Mr Right. Then there is Becky (Cheryl Hines) who is quite the glamour-puss (for a diner waitress) but stuck with an invalid husband. Neither have it great but they would never trade places with Jenna either.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe story begins with Jenna finding out that she is pregnant by her louse of a husband and it scuppers her plans to run away with the little money she has been able to save from Earl (Sisto) who snatches all her earnings as soon as she is in the car. She visits the town doctor, Dr Pomatter who has just moved to town and is young and some would say rather good looking. Her enlightenment begins, in ways that I am sure you can imagine.\r\n</p><p>\r\nA lot of the action (not just between Jenna and the Dr) takes place in the diner with the constant presence of the old owner Joe (Andy Griffith) who is an absolute delight to watch. The grumpy man doesn't give an inch to anyone, complains at every opportunity and no one seems to give him the time of day, apart from Jenna who is forced to serve him on every shift. You slowly fall in love with him as the film goes on, he is one of the few characters that you might well really run in to in an old diner and that really shows through.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThis film offers few surprises but serves up a good dose of feel good scenes and leaves you with a warm tingly feeling as you leave the cinema, and guaranteed panging for the gorgeous pies that grace the screen many times. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIt's a lovely film shot with great sensitivity, incorporating\r\nAdrienne's own unique style and slightly (but deliberate) stereotyped characterization and framing with empathy, understanding and grace.\r\n</p><p>\r\nNow for the not so good bits - Jenna is such a strong, intelligent and thoughtful person but there is no justification as to why she would end up with an idiot such as Earl. It doesn't quite seem to fit. The chemistry between Jenna and the Dr is also a little dubious at times and the film also very much glosses over the adultery that is key to the story without ever saying that it is wrong but these minor criticisms are easily overtaken by the good points.\r\n</p><p>\r\nShelly was sadly killed in October 2006 only a few weeks after finding out that this film was to be featured in the Sundance Film Festival (to critical acclaim).  Therefore this film probably has received more attention that it otherwise would, but it absolutely doesn't just ride on the coat tails of a tragic behind the scenes story. It justifies the extra attention it received and the excellent reception from the Sundance Festival. It is a witty, sensitive film and one that makes the film-going public realise the potential of a director (and talented actress), sadly just a little too late.\r\n</p>	4	2011-03-26	476	2011-03-26
480	1	23	\N	Michael Clayton	<p>\r\nA corporate lawyer, who is used to cleaning up his clients' messes, ends up trying to salvage a case against an agrichemical company after a fellow litigator suffers a potential breakdown and drags the case down with him.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWrongdoings in the corridors of power are clearly an obsession of Michael Clayton director Tony Gilroy. Although this is his debut behind the camera, his previous efforts as a screenwriter include the CIA-shadiness of the three <i>'Jason Bourne'</i> films and the satanic courtroom ham-fest that was <i>The Devil's Advocate</i>. \r\n</p><p>\r\nMichael Clayton also concerns shady legal dealings by men with loose ties in harshly lit offices, but is thankfully a little more subtle than the undeniably fun, but ludicrous <i>'Advocate'</i>. \r\n</p><p>\r\nGeorge Clooney (Ocean's Thirteen) gives a superb central performance as the eponymous 'hero', a jaded, poker-addicted former prosecutor who has spent the last 15 years widening the hole in the soul to epic proportions as a fixer for a top New York corporate law firm. Clayton deals with the firm's back-alley jobs; if a valued client is involved in a hit-and-run, a wife gets caught shoplifting or a manic depressive senior firm partner strips naked in a meeting, he gets the call. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIt is this last assignment that drives the slow-building plot of Michael Clayton, as top litigator Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson - The Exorcism of Emily Rose) breaks down very publicly from the stress of an ongoing case involving the defence of a company, U North, which is knowingly selling carcinogenetic weedkiller. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWilkinson should go one further than his Oscar nomination for <i>'In The Bedroom'</i> for his remarkable work as the manic, childlike but fiercely intelligent man who is destroyed by his conscience. His ravings are hilarious, incomprehensible, poignant and, at times, deeply resonant. The skill of Wilkinson's performance is that he never lets you forget that Arthur may be loosing his mind, but he is also still a legal genius. In his mental breakdown at the sheer scale of corporate skulduggery going on in his case, he is more human than those that keep their suits on. \r\n</p><p>\r\nRepresenting the other side of the corporate coin is Tilda Swinton's (The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe) icy and awkward Karen Crowder, U North's in house legal council, who is all too aware of what her company's products are doing. Although Swinton does sterling work giving some humanity to Karen in the scenes showing her rehearsing her speeches and self-consciously dressing for meetings, the character feels a little thin. You get the feeling that cuts had to be made to move the plot along. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIt is interesting to see how the man that brought the all-action antics of <i>Jason Bourne</i> to screen chooses a more sedate pace for his directorial debut. Michael Clayton slowly builds up, showing little snippets and insights into the complex characters while the plot gradually acquires momentum. When some action - in the Bourne sense of the word at least - does arrive it is chilling in its everyday matter-of-factness. This approach is what makes Michael Clayton such a successful debut for Tony Gilroy. It doesn't go for brash over the top styling and is all the more disturbing for emphasising the calculated, mundane nature of corporate murder. \r\n</p>	4	2011-03-26	480	2011-03-26
482	1	1	\N	Death at a Funeral	<p>\r\nOK, so we've got a mainly British cast, full of faces you recognise but it takes you the whole film to work out exactly where you've seen them, it's a comedy, and it has got 'funeral' in the title. Remind you of any other well known British film? Yep. And that was exactly what I thought when I sat down to watch it. Not that I don't like that film, but I didn't want to watch it again, just with a new generation of young-ish British hopefuls.\r\n</p><p>\r\nHaving settled down in the knowledge that this would be a pleasant but been there, seen that kind of a film, I walked out at the end having thoroughly enjoyed myself.  I actually laughed out loud, as did all the other people in the screening, on numerous occasions. That is not something I do regularly, so I have to give it some credit.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe opening title set you up for a dated comedy, the music is that of a 70's sitcom or some delightfully forgettable lift music, sedate, comforting and lengthy. These are 3 words you can't associate with this film from the opening scene onwards. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe lead character is Daniel (Matthew MacFadyen - Pride and Prejudice), the son of the patriarch whose funeral we are attending. He has always been in his brother Robert's shadow. The prodigal son, Robert (Rupert Graves - V for Vendetta) now lives in New York as a 'successful' author and really, why isn't he doing the eulogy? The film follows their father's funeral and all that it entails.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOne of the particular highlights of the very strong cast is Andy Nyman (Severance). He plays Howard, Daniel's friend.  Nyman, an intriguing mix between Ricky Gervais and that geeky guy from Peep Show, except shorter and harbouring a much higher voice, is great. We also have Simon (Alan Tudyk - Serenity), the fiance of a cousin of the family who desperately wants to impress his soon to be father-in-law. He is so worried about making a good impression that he ends up taking valium. Except it isn't valium but a home brewed hallucinogen from his fiance's brother, accidentally administered... the farce now begins. The coffin moves, there is a strange steely eyed dwarf lurking around, Uncle Albert needs a poo, but he can't do it himself, the vicar is totally desperate to leave and there is a naked man on the roof. Mix all that up, add a few more chucklesome ingredients and you get the gist of the story. Fun and frolics in middle England.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAll in all, it's a fun film, and one that is written with a bit of an edge to it, modern humour in a tried and tested formula. It really does work. If you'd just like a film to make you giggle, then this is the one to go for. Good cast, good script, good stuff.\r\n</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	482	2011-03-26
506	1	20	"Do you want to win the war on terror? This is the quintessential question of our time."	Lions for Lambs	<p>The Oscar season is looming and we the audience can expect many moody movies over the next few months as studios and stars alike position themselves for praise. <i>Lions For Lambs</i> is probably one of the outsiders and rightly so. </p><p>\r\nRobert Redford (The Horse Whisperer) returns to the big screen as both actor and director in this thought provoking look at America. The movie has three separate story lines that each help explore the current war on terror. </p><p>\r\nIn a richly furnished office in Washington young ambitious Senator Jasper Irving (Tom Cruise - MI3) explains to professional journalist Janine Roth (Meryl Streep - Rendition), his bold new plan to bring victory to the US in Afghanistan. Meanwhile across country in an unnamed university Professor Malley (Robert Redford - Spy Game) has a frank discussion with one of his most promising yet most reluctant students, Todd (Andrew Garfield), about life and the young lad's waning interest in study. </p><p>\r\nLinking these two dissimilar threads is the story of two young US soldiers, Ernest (Michael Pena - Shooter) and Arian (Derek Luke - Catch a Fire) who find themselves alone on a godforsaken mountain under attack from the Taliban who are camped there. These two soldiers are former students of Professor Malley and wound up on that mountain thanks to Senator Irving's latest military plan. </p><p>\r\nThe movie structure is great and the topics discussed are both relevant and well balanced. In a thought provoking piece such as this the movie should make no judgement itself and leave the audience to make its own conclusions. For the most part this film succeeds in this challenging task but at times did sway strongly to one side of the argument. </p><p>\r\nThe acting is uniformly brilliant as you'd expect from such heavyweight stars yet none of the three principal leads really shone out or put in a career defining role. Most probably the best performances are from the relatively unknown actors Andrew Garfield as Todd, Michael Pena as Ernest and Derek Luke as Arian. </p><p>\r\nThe movie had a good heart and did manage to tackle many issues surrounding the central theme of Afghanistan including political propaganda, the apathy of the well off and educated youth, the mistakes of the past and the doubts over the future. These weighty topics do make you think but after an hour they also make your head ache and you realise that yes, your ass is going numb. </p><p>\r\nDespite best intentions this film is just a bit too slow and heavy for the average audience and while it'll win praise for its intelligent content it doesn't stand out above the other similarly themed movies we have seen in the last few years. </p><p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	506	2012-03-08
486	1	20	\N	Shoot em Up	<p>\r\nIf there is an award for the highest body count in an action movie (not including acts of terrorism etc) then <i>'Shoot ''em Up</i> must be a contender. From the first minute to the last there are bullets flying, blood spraying and undertakers rubbing their hands with glee.\r\n</p><p>\r\nClive Owen (<i>Children of Men</i>) is Mr. Smith, a no-nonsense maniac sitting at a bus stop enjoying an organic carrot when a screaming pregnant lady stumbles past pursued by a madman with a gun. Ruthless as he is, the attempted murder of a pregnant lady is enough to spur Smith into action. He saves the girl and helps her deliver her baby while he kills the first wave of attackers. During their escape from the scene the lady is killed and Smith reluctantly snatches the baby and goes on the run.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWhy are seemingly dozen of paid cannon fodder trying to kill the innocent baby? Why do they all have top of the line firepower? Why does Smith hate almost everyone and everything? All good questions that will be answered while Smith and his only trusted ally, Donna (Monica Bellucci - <i>The Brothers Grimm</i>), a lactating prostitute, search for safety and more bullets. So we have our reluctant hero, who is the ubiquitous villain? Is it some muscle bound kung fu fighting assassin? No, it''s a podgy bearded Paul Giamatti (<i>Lady in the Water</i>), who is highly intelligent and cold as stone but not without some humour.\r\n</p><p>\r\nNo need to dwell on the Shakespearean plot or the dramatic locations as this film is intended for one thing only, fun needless violence, delivered in oodles. Where else will you see not one but three men killed by organic carrots? The movie is packed with imaginatively choreographed shoot outs, a quick bout of full on rumpy pumpy, and many a great one liner or visual gag to keep you chuckling at the absurdity of it all.\r\n</p><p>\r\nDeciding on a rating for this movie isn''t as bad as I thought it would be. I weighed up the thin story and cliche cool characters against the well designed action pieces and the frequent humour. Then I remember it is called <i>Shoot ''em Up</i>. Anyone attracted to such a blatant and unimaginative title (fans of the say <i>Snakes on a Plane</i>) are not expecting anything other than a guilty pleasure and for those peeps this film is great. \r\n</p><p>\r\nStrongly recommended for fans of <i>Hard Boiled</i>, <i>Rush Hour</i>, and the <i>Die Hard</i> movies.   \r\n</p>	4	2011-03-26	486	2011-03-26
487	1	15	\N	3-10 to Yuma	<p>During the late nineteenth century the United States' emerging railways were bringing prosperity to the harsh lands of the arid western states. The large profits involved attracted criminals, bandits and gunmen who would kill to get their hands on such sums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>None were more ruthless than Ben Wade (Russell Crowe - A Good Year) and his notorious gang of robbers. Dan Evans (Christian Bale - Batman Begins), a civil war veteran who is barely making a living for his family as a cattle rancher, witnesses the aftermath of Wade's brutal assault on a stagecoach transporting railway profits and is deprived by the outlaw of his horses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evans, whose drought suffering land is under threat from the expanding railway network, eventually arrives in the local town of Bizby and reveals that the coach has been robbed but is surprised to see that Wade, now without his gang, has remained in the town's saloon to celebrate his success with a woman. The killer is duly arrested and the railway operator offers up a cash reward for anyone willing to help escort Wade to a nearby town's station where he can be put on the 3.10 train to trial in Yuma.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Despite the very real danger posed by Wade's gang and the slippery man himself, Evans knows that $200 could save his ranch and earn him back his self respect so volunteers to be part of the escort.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Firstly I must admit to having never seen the original 3.10 to Yuma, which starred Glenn Ford and was released in cinemas in 1957. I am aware that the remake does follow the original's plot quite closely although it also deviates at key points. As a result of this I can only judge this modern version on its own merits without reference to an inspiration, which I suspect very few modern cinema goers will be familiar with.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The plot may be taken from the golden age of Hollywood westerns but the producers have updated the setting to reflect an existence more reminiscent of the hard, violent, frontier lifestyle as shown on the foul mouthed television series Deadwood than anything ever experienced by John Wayne. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Audiences may have fallen out of love with Westerns and their old fashioned values but 3.10 to Yuma reminded me most of Michael Mann's crime thriller Heat. Both films pit two fascinating characters into psychological and physical struggle for supremacy in a world they have approached from diametrically opposite directions. It helps that the two leads are played by such accomplished performers.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Russell Crowe's Ben Wade is a charming assassin as quick with his tongue as with his guns. Well aware that what he does is wrong, this seemingly educated man appears to revel in his notoriety but follows a peculiar code of honour and respects other honourable men.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Humble Evans is just such a man. A simple farmer, who has himself lost the respect of his son, begins to see his journey to the station as a path to redemption both for his family and his honour.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>These two men must negotiate the dangers of the West together en route to a destination where death must wait for one of them. Although the central pairing of Bale and Crowe dominate proceedings, the film's most memorable performance comes from Ben Foster (Alpha Dog) as Wade's doggedly loyal right hand man Charlie. Separated from his master he assumes the leadership of Wade's band of killers and embarks on a ruthless hunt to track down the posse escorting his boss to the train. Foster's reptilian eyes mesmerise and his icy demeanour gives his every scene palpable menace. To think that this is the same guy who once played the romantic lead in teen comedy Get Over It is bizarre considering he now seems to have cornered the market as extremely believable psychos.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The sense of foreboding that accompanies Evans as he attempts to complete his mission builds up some serious anticipation as he finds himself barricaded in a Yuma hotel room with Wade, while Charlie prowls outside and all his allies' desert him.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>To say that 3.10 to Yuma is the best western you will see all year isn't saying very much but it is a genuinely exciting action film where the characters have real depth and the story grips all the way to the memorable shootout finale.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	487	2011-03-26
488	1	1	\N	SuperBad	<p>\r\nThe summer is drawing to an end, the blockbusters are starting to fade away, and it's time for the rom-coms and the stupid high-school coming of age rubbish. This is what we come to expect of in the closing summer months, to be lightly entertained as the nights draw in and the temperature goes down (well, sort of). So how happy was I when I went to see SuperBad, a high school comedy (groan) about 2 inseparable boys graduating and their final party before they, well, separate for college. Directed by Greg Mottola and produced by Judd Apatow (Knocked Up, The 40 Year-Old Virgin), it was the funniest movie I'd seen in ages. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSeth (Jonah Hill - Evan Almighty) and Evan (Michael Cera - Veronica Mars [TV]) aren't our typical film students. They are real, funny and hugely believable. The casting is absolutely spot on and it was only through reading the background behind this great film that I found out that Seth was as old as the writers who were deemed too old to play their own parts. The writers Evan Goldbert and Seth Rogen (Knocked Up) have been school friends and co-writers for many years and they started the screenplay when they were just 14. They claim it isn't purely them but lots of the things that happened on the night in the movie actually happened to them, or at least someone they knew. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThere are shining performances throughout, one of the strongest being Christopher Mintz-Plasse who plays Fogell. He is completely new to acting and was plucked from obscurity due to the challenge of finding just the right person, and not finding him through the normal audition procedure. Probably the closest to the clone high school stereotype of biggest school geek, but yet, oh so much better. How can you think you are James Bond, a magnet to the ladies, while being the biggest geek in the world but also being liked by the audience? I'm doing him no justice. Go see him to see what I mean. As you can see, this certainly isn't a film just about Seth and Evan, it goes far beyond those expectations and in fact some characters come very close to eclipsing the two leads. That is nothing to do with any weakness in the acting or casting of the characters, they are perfect for the parts and I loved watching them. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThere are 2 more characters worthy of special mention, and not just because one of them is the script writer (Evan Goldbert, Seth Rogen) It is the cop duo, they were a real breath of fresh air, and are the epitome of how every boy in the world would like to play at being a cop. Having these two characters in the film really is a masterstroke. They are pretty much the only adults in the entire film but they don't really count as such.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWith all these crazy shenanigans going on you could be forgiven for thinking that this film is shallow. It manages to balance the adolescent jokes and stupidity with real moments of sensitivity. It manages to get that balance right, never straying in to cringe territory for too long and giving us characters that we really do like.  Oooh and a cracking 70's funk-soul soundtrack to boot.\r\n</p><p>\r\nI feel I have gushed a little too much and don't want to have built this film up more then I should have, it's not going to change your life in any way and lots of people will find it too crude for their liking, but if you want a film to put a smile on your face and you have a mental age of between 15 and 21, then this is the film for you.\r\n</p>	4	2011-03-26	488	2011-03-26
489	1	20	\N	Run, Fat Boy, Run	<p>\r\nIt's Dennis' big day and his bottle is gone. Downstairs his super hot and heavily pregnant fiance, Libby, is finishing off the final decorations on the wedding cake while his best man, Gordon, is waiting at the door to escort him to the church. The enormity of the day, of the responsibility, is too much. What does he do? He runs.\r\n</p><p>\r\n<i><b>"Run Fatboy Run"</b></i> is the directorial debut of David <i>"Ross Geller"</i> Schwimmer of <i>"Friends"</i> fame who succeeds in making a nice feel good comedy. Set in London (always guaranteed to gain extra stars from this reviewer), Schwimmer reunites with his <i>"Big Nothing"</i> co-star Simon Pegg and manages to pull together an impressive cast for this jolly jog through Rom-Com territory. <i>"Four sets of italics in one sentence; I must stop this font based foolery."</i>\r\n</p><p>\r\nFive years after bunking his wedding and Dennis (Simon Pegg - Hot Fuzz) is a fat, single, pathetic man who works each day as a security guard defending a woman's lingerie store from transsexual shoplifters. His only ray of light is the few moments each week he gets to share with his five year old son, Jake, while thinking of ways to win back the respect of Libby (Thandie Newton - Norbit).\r\n</p><p>\r\nOne day while collecting Jake, Dennis encounters his new nemesis; Whit (Hank Azaria - The Simpsons Movie), an American banker who is making moves on Libby and highlighting with his perfect manners and motivation all the things lacking in Dennis' character. Whit is wealthy, he is ambitious and he runs marathons for charity. \r\n</p><p> \r\nDennis realises the woman he ditched, the woman he loves, could be lost forever if he doesn't do something. What does he do? He runs. Fatboy signs up to run a marathon alongside Whit to prove to his love and his son that he can commit to something, that he can be honourable and dedicated. One small problem; he's a useless slob. Enter Gordon (Dylan Moran - A Cock and Bull Story).\r\n</p><p>\r\nGordon is Libby's cousin and Dennis' best friend. He is also a shameless gambling addict who sees a chance to clear his debts by placing a large bet on Dennis to complete the marathon. Losing the bet may mean losing some limbs so Gordon has a vested interest in helping his friend across the finish line. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhat follows is your underdog story as the feeble Dennis tries to quit the fags and fast food and summon the stamina and strength to run the marathon. Along the way Dennis' friends provide some back story and sub plot and mixed in with the comedy we get a few heartfelt moments that raise this film above expectations.\r\n</p><p>\r\nShot beautifully and taking full advantage of London's scenery Schwimmer has made a lovely little film that will undoubtedly do well here and hopefully will make an impression across the pond. Simon Pegg puts in a career best combining his well tested comedy with some serious emotional moments, and more worryingly has to endure Hank Azaria's undercarriage wiggling a foot from his face. Hank Azaria is suitably irritating as the overly perfect Whit and is a good counter balance to Dennis' flawed wannabe runner. In support Thandie Newton offers beauty and little else as the love interest while Dylan Moran is ever brilliant as the self serving bastard he plays so well. Special mention should also go to Harish Patel (Chicken Tikka Massala) as Mr. Ghoshdashtidar, Dennis' moral support and abusive spatula wielding landlord.\r\n</p><p>\r\nA great date movie and a hidden gem.\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	489	2011-03-26
490	1	4	\N	Evening	<p>\r\nDon't expect to come skipping out of this film, as it's a far cry from being the Sound of Music. <i>Evening</i> is very deep, powerful and poignant. And it gives you more to think about than your therapist would like.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe film dissects the relationships between mother Ann Lord, played by Vanessa Redgrave (Atonement), who is on her deathbed with her two daughters by her side. Constance  is a content family woman played by real life daughter Natasha Richardson (Maid in Manhattan) while Nina is a restless single woman played by Toni Collette (Little Miss Sunshine). \r\n</p><p>\r\nTo add depth and a point to the story, a secret is revealed. Is there any better time than on your deathbed to divulge that you have a one true love and may well have killed somebody? Enter a script that could have been written by the executive producers of Eastenders.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe film draws you in by jumping back and forth through time in true "Titanic" fashion, to 50 years earlier when a young Ann, played by Claire Danes (The Family Stone), attends the high society wedding as the bridesmaid to her friend Lila Wittenborn (Mamie Gummer - The Hoax). Lila gets cold feet and turns to her friend Ann for support. Ann is equally close to Lila's irresponsible brother Buddy (Hugh Dancy - Shooting Fish), in fact all three have an implied closeness as they've been "inseparable" since college.  It is a shame this three-way relationship wasn't explored fully. It would have made Ann's meeting of wedding guest and lifelong friends of the Wittenborn family, Harris (Patrick Wilson - Running With Scissors) more heartfelt. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThis two-day whirlwind encounter was supposed to be the life changing meeting that was to shape Ann's life, but there were so many little story lines that were dropped in that the dramatisation of their encounter was a little lost. Although Ann did harp on about it all through the movie, but because you didn't feel hardly any chemistry initially between the two, some interest was lost here. Also when they jumped back 50 years earlier, they gave all the men the same look, so it was difficult to see what was so striking about this Harris character, who tried to be mysterious but came across as someone who took himself too seriously and a bit wooden.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe fact that Lila was also in love with this elusive Harris should have added some dynamic to this love-quadrangle, but this was one of the storylines that was left hanging at the end when an older Lila (who morphs into her real life mother Meryl Streep - Devil Wears Prada) comes to see her dying friend.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn trying to be deep and interesting, the film leaves a lot of loose ends, as they add too many sub-plot lines in to try and get the audience to give a damn, but after two hours, they are just dropped. It has quite a few huge stars but they weren't made the most of and blended with the other bland characters. Maybe this was because with so many big stars, it was difficult to give them all their 5 minutes of screen time so no one character could really be developed. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIt does give you a lot to discuss and think about afterwards, but it came across more unintentional rather than that being the point! All that being said, the film was moving and it had some lovely scenery and dreamy shots and I enjoyed it. \r\n</p><p>\r\nFans of <i>The English Patient</i> and <i>Captain Corelli's Mandolin</i> will enjoy this movie.\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	490	2011-03-26

His daughter Fatima (Zineb Oukach) has gone against his wishes and run off with a local boy so he has plenty to deal with at home and at the office.\r\n</p><p>\r\n<i>'Rendition'</i> is a political reminder of the practice of extraordinary rendition where terror suspects are transported from the country where they are captured to their home countries or other countries where they can be questioned or held to gather intelligence.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFawal should be commended for his great acting in this movie as the brutal and terrifying interrogator.  Acting from the other big names was good but nothing that stood out.\r\n</p><p>\r\nRendition has an important story to tell and it has more political depth than some of the other recent terrorist-related movies such as <i>The Kingdom</i> and <i>Spy Game</i>.\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	500	2012-03-08
509	1	1	Blah	Sicko	<p>The new Michael Moore documentary tackles the US Health Service, or lack of, according to Moore. As he is well known for he only deals with good vs evil without ever looking at a counter argument on either side, but if he actually started doing that, he wouldn't be Michael Moore. Basically don't expect a thoroughly backed up argument taking both sides and interrogating the situation fairly. You're not going to get it.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe documentary is 2 hours long and in my opinion that is pushing it as after the first half, nothing much is added, more that the points are laboured with further, more charged examples. Again, typical Moore style but with added arrogance that I just didn't much like.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe core of this film is that the insurance companies and the pharmaceutical companies are now fully in charge of the health service in America. Even with taking all statistics and claims made by Moore with a pinch of salt this seems a fact that can't be argued. They have horrific policies in rejecting people's claims for needed care. This film is about people with insurance who get screwed over by their insurance companies, those that thought they were safe, and as Michael Moore says, thought they were a part of the 'American Dream' and by the looks of this film, how wrong they were. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWe start by meeting a middle-aged couple moving in to their daughter's house. In to her store room to be exact. We learn that she used to be a successful journalist while he was a teacher. They had good health insurance cover and lived very comfortably. Then the husband started to have heart attacks and she was diagnosed with cancer. The 'deductibles' (things that weren't considered to be covered by their policy) soon added up and not only were they fighting serious health problems, they had to sell their house and they basically lost everything. As we learn through the film, they are far from an isolated case. Following on from this couple we start to learn a bit more about the way the insurance companies tick.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMoore had set up a website to collect people's experiences in dealing with insurance companies, but it very quickly became a whistleblowing site. Hundreds of people from inside insurance companies emailed him to tell how things were. Doctors and advisers were paid bonuses for more applications for care being denied and it was drummed in to workers that they were to make savings for the company by denying care. Shocking stuff.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn between meeting all these whistle-blowers, the people who have been completely screwed over by their insurance companies and the humorous inserts that Moore would make about politics, Bush, the Iraq war and anything else he hates, we are taken on a tour around the best free and state health services around the world. From the perfectly acceptable to the down right amazing; Canada, UK, France and... Cuba.... Yep, Cuba.  America's evil neighbour. This is all interesting stuff but the way Moore portrays all these health services are just a little too good to be true. I'm pretty sure the NHS has some fairly major issues itself, but these of course weren't touched upon and we leave Britain thinking that all GPs are rich, all patients are dealt with in 20 minutes flat and a national health service is the answer to everyone's problems.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThere are some very touching moments in this film and it is certainly interesting for a global audience but it is fundamentally an American's film, and so it should be. From the footage Moore uses in the documentary it seems clear that Americans are fed a lot of rubbish about the state of the health system, anyone who speaks out about it is quickly quashed and insurance companies should never, ever have as much power as they have. He speaks about Americans in the first person and uses 9/11 rescue workers and Guantanamo Bay terrorists to great effect.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nThis is an emotive piece of work with people who are in an unquestionably awful situation that is totally unfair and completely upsetting. It is a film I walked away from having learnt a lot about Moore's point of view, but also with some scepticism over where the facts have come from and how realistic it would be to implement a national health service in America. And, after all, if it is easy to trot over to Cuba and get free health care, why not just do that?   \r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	509	2012-03-08
495	1	12	\N	Brick Lane	<p>\r\nAmid controversy over its portrayal of Bengali immigrants in East London, the film adaptation of Monica Ali's best-selling novel <i>Brick Lane</i> has soulless cash-in slapped all over it, which makes it all the more surprising when it turns out to be very good.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAli's story focuses on the character of Nazneen (Tannishtha Chatterjee), married off to an older man at the age of 17 and sent to live with him in Tower Hamlets. Nazeen leads a solitary life, only venturing out of her block of flats to buy food or go shopping with her husband Chanu (Satish Kaushik), but things change when she meets the young radical Karim (Christopher Simpson).\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe narrative of the novel is driven by Nazneen's inner musings, and the film does well to convey her moods and feelings without resorting to a continuous voiceover. The letters she receives from her older sister Hasina evoke both flashbacks to her childhood in Bangladesh and Hasina's imagined presence in London.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWith running length a consideration when adapting a novel spanning twenty years, some aspects of the plot had to go. The details regarding Nazneen's first-born, her sister's life in Dhaka and the usurer Mrs Islam do not detract from the story, but the sense of monotonous repetition in Nazneen's daily ritual is conspicuously absent and this undermines the film's initial premise of her life being stagnant.\r\n</p><p>\r\nChanu comes across as a better character here, still dreaming of returning home and insistent that his daughters behave properly, but ultimately a good man. His refusal to let Nazneen have English lessons was removed from the film, and thus her eventual decision at the story's end seems less questionable than in the book, yet there is still a slightly sour taste in the mouth at the defence of arranged marriages.\r\n</p><p>\r\nDisagreements with the story aside, the film is a success, buoyed by the performances of the trio at its heart and excellent direction from first-timer Sarah Gavron. With beautifully framed shots to be found in every scene, at times it felt like I was watching art-house cinema.\r\nAll in all, a splendid adaptation.\r\n</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	495	2011-03-26
497	1	20	\N	Ratatouille	<p>\r\nPixar (Cars) returns with another fantastical animated story to entertain children and adults alike. Last year we saw talking cars find the meaning of friendship, before that we watched a family of superheroes thwart the plans of a psychotic fan. Now Pixar presents its latest effort, the story of a lowly sewer rat who dreams of becoming a master chef.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter their farmyard colony is found by a vengeful old lady, the rat community flees into the sewers but poor Remy gets separated from his family and finds himself lost beneath the streets of Paris with only a cookbook for company.\r\n</p><p>\r\nRemy has always dreamt of being a chef and when he heads above ground he soon finds himself on the roof of the famous Gusteau restaurant where a new rubbish boy, Linguini, is making a terrible soup. Remy comes to the rescue and manages to transform the horrid broth into a wonderful soup. Linguini is amazed by Remy's ability to cook but when head chef Skinner sees the rat he orders Linguini to kill it.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSitting on the side of the Seine with Remy in a jar Linguini confronts his failings and strikes up an unlikely friendship with the little rat. Linguini will act as a human puppet for the little chef Remy. That way Linguini keeps his job and Remy can cook like a real chef.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe arrangement works well but soon the public demand more and more recipes from the marvellous young Linguini, and also he falls in love with his mentor (not Remy), but an attractive lady chef called Collette. Meanwhile in Linguini's hat Remy has problems as well, his family expects him to steal food and his father in particular disapproves of Remy's friendship with humans.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMadcap culinary adventures, jealous colleagues, guiding spirits and the ever worrying presence of rats in a cooking environment make for a fun filled family movie. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe quality of the animation in this movie is very high and the set pieces are very well thought out. The attention to minor detail, ever present in Pixar pictures, is still there as are the numerous little nods to previous Pixar movies and other pop movie references.\r\n</p><p>\r\nHeavyweight vocal talent is provided by Sir Ian Holm (The Aviator) as vengeful chef Skinner, and Sir Peter O'Toole (Stardust) as fearsome food critic Anton Ego.  Other famous voices include Brian Dennehy (Assault on Precinct 13) as dad rat, Lou Remano (Cars - vocal) as Linguini and Patton Oswalt (Failure to Launch) as Remy the little chef.\r\n</p><p>\r\nRatatouille is a fun film that should delight children and entertain adults. It may not be Pixar's best movie to date but it is still far better than many of the other animations we have seen this year. \r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	497	2011-03-26
499	1	20	\N	Stardust	<p>\r\nA young ambitious man, Tristan (Charlie Cox - Casanova) lives a humdrum life in a sleepy English town where he dreams endlessly of the local beauty, Victoria (Sienna Miller - Factory Girl). The town is ordinary enough, as is Tristan, but beyond a wall on the outskirts of town lays a mysterious magical kingdom guarded by an octogenarian. \r\n</p><p>\r\nTristan's love for Victoria is blind and one night as he dotes on the materialistic bimbo they both spy a falling star, a star that falls into the previously mentioned magical kingdom. Tristan promises to find the star and present it to Victoria as a gift hoping it will win her affection. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAt the same time as Tristan spies the falling star, beyond the wall some rather different characters all crave that same rare windfall. The first is an ambitious collection of princes that search for a gem held by the falling star, for the one who finds the gem will reign as king. The second bunch of treasure hunters are even more macabre; a trio of ancient self centered witches who wish to eat the heart of the star to regain their youth and further their reign of wickedness.\r\n</p><p>\r\nUnaware of his competition, young Tristan heads for the magical kingdom where he soon finds the star; a rather unwilling star who is unimpressed by being dislodged from her place in the heavens and even more annoyed by the young upstart who wished to present her as a gift to his wannabe bit of crumpet. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhat follows is a fun magical adventure as our fish-out-of-water hero leads his new found star back towards home beset by evil witches, murderous princes and even scarier, a market trader that looks suspiciously like Ricky Gervais (Night at the Museum). \r\n</p><p>\r\nAll in all Stardust was a pleasant fairytale adventure with a good sense of humour, and love story, all rolled into one. The stellar cast played their parts well, often against type, and although it lacked surprises it was entertaining. If effects are sometimes shaky it is easily forgotten because of the stunning English and Welsh scenery. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAs a lead, Charlie Cox managed to hold his ground against a myriad of big names without getting left in the shade. This is mostly due to a humorous script and good chemistry with his co-star Claire Danes (Evening) who plays the fallen star Yvaine. I'll give a quick nod to Robert DeNiro (The Good Shepherd) as Captain Shakespeare who harbours (terrible pun) a secret identity, and the ever impressive Michelle Pfeiffer (Hairspray) as the villainous witch Lamia. \r\n</p><p>\r\nNot a patch on the <i> 'Potter'</i> movies when it comes to magic but a welcome break from adolescent wand waving nonetheless. I'd recommend this to fans of films like<i> 'Willow'</i>,<i> 'Legend'</i> and brilliant <i> 'The Princess Bride'</i>.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	499	2011-03-26
508	1	23	Caine and Law thesp-it-up in theatrical remake	Sleuth	<p>Two superb central performances and a cracking Harold Pinter script cannot save Sleuth from the curse of having Kenneth Branagh behind the camera. \r\n</p><p>\r\nHowever much Branagh uses ultra-modern sets, unusual framing and stylised lighting, this remake feels too much like a made for TV play. It's a sleek and lean re-imagining of the 1972 original and does establish itself as a distinctly different film, just not a better one. That's not to say that it isn't an intriguing watch. For a film that only features two characters, Sleuth is a complex film. \r\n</p><p>\r\nJude Law's (The Holiday) cocky struggling actor Milo Tindle arrives at the mansion of millionaire crime writer Andrew Wyke (Michael Caine - The Prestige) to ask the elder man to divorce his wife who has become Tindle's lover. What follows is an intense battle of wills between the two men, where the prize is all but forgotten in the face of male pride. \r\n</p><p>\r\nMichael Caine's performance as the jilted husband shows he was born to deliver Nobel Prize-winning playwright Harold Pinter's barbed and brutal lines. Some of the exchanges between Caine and Jude Law are mesmerising in their intensity as the two men jostle for verbal and physical supremacy. \r\n</p><p>\r\nInitially, dominance is with Wyke. He backs Tindle into a corner after mocking his younger quarry's foppish appearance and vagueness about his acting career ("You're a hairdresser aren't you?"). When the first joust closes it is very much, as the man himself says, "game, set and match" Wyke. But Milo fights back with all he's got. \r\n</p><p>\r\nJude Law is convincing as both victim and aggressor in the Milo Tindle role, played by Caine in the original. It's only in a couple of scenes where the true class of the elder statesman shows him up. Law also drifts a little too far towards RADA-style theatrics in Sleuth's climax. But it's a far more accomplished effort at stepping into Caine's shoes than his uber-smug turn in <i>Alfie</i>. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe two leads and Pinter deserve a lot of credit for crafting a remake that dares to do something different with a classic. It's just a shame Sleuth doesn't have a director that can drag it further away from its theatrical roots.\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	508	2012-03-08
501	1	20	\N	Balls of Fury	<p>\r\nImagine <i>'Dodgeball'</i> mixed with <i>'Enter the Dragon'</i> and you'll have a good handle on this movie. Randy Daytona was the teenage US Olympic table tennis sensation destined to win gold and immortality when fate intervened. Randy's father, Sgt Pete, had a gambling problem and at the Seoul Olympics he bet too much with the wrong people that his son would win. Overburdened with that knowledge Randy slipped and fell losing his match against a lycra clad German. Vengeful bookies then claimed revenge on his father. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSkip forward a dozen or so years and the one time sporting prodigy is now a fat foul mouthed sarcastic entertainer working in a dingy club in Reno. Thinking he can sink no lower than performing ping pong tricks to fat flatulent diners Randy (Dan Fogler -Good Luck Chuck) unexpectedly receives a visit from the FBI. The crime boss who killed Randy's father, Feng, annually hosts a secret high stakes ping pong tournament. The FBI asks Randy to dust off his paddle and hit the tournament circuit and, hopefully, get invited into the secret dark underworld of table tennis. \r\n</p><p>\r\nOnly problem there is that Randy is more out of shape than a Picasso and needs some serious help to get his eye back on the little white ball. Leaping to the next clich to spoof, Randy is taken to a Chinese table tennis school ruled over by the blind ping pong master who trained the evil Feng. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe blind master, assisted by his beautiful neice Maggie (Maggie Q - MI3), reluctantly take on their new student. After some serious training issues Randy is back on form and is finally invited to Feng's tournament, this is where the film kicks it up a gear. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe tournament, closely akin to the death match central to <i>'Enter the Dragon'</i>, is filled with insanity championed by Feng himself, Christopher 'psycho for hire' Walken (Man on Fire). \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe story is as thin as Maggie Q's legs and some of the jokes are as predictable but overall this is madcap comedy for the masses and it delivers well on the premise. Dan Fogler gets his chance to lead and does well, although he must try not to emulate his fellow fat rocking comedian Jack Black; that is a competition he hasn't won yet!\r\n</p><p>\r\nRecommended for fans of madcap spoof comedies such as <i>'Dodgeball'</i>, <i>'Talladega Nights'</i>, <i>'Spy Hard'</i> and anything by Mel Brooks.\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	501	2011-03-26

During his graphic autopsy, a tape is retrieved which reveals that Jigsaw's games will carry on regardless of his death.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWhen another detective shows up dead, SWAT commander Rigg (Lyriq Bent - Take the Lead) makes it his personal mission to save, yet again, his remaining fellow comrades.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nInstead, as one of the few officers that has faced Jigsaw's wrath, Rigg gets drawn into the next evil game of cat and mouse.  He faces numerous criminals who are pleading for their lives and he has to toss up whether to save them or let them die.  In return he will get closer to saving the lives of colleagues Eric Mathews (Donnie Wahlberg - Dead Silence) and Hoffman (Costas Mandylor - Payback) who have 90 minutes to escape from a deadly trap.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMeanwhile, FBI agents Strahm (Scott Patterson - Will & Grace [TV]) and Perez (Athena Karkanis - Kojak [TV] are trying to piece together the 'jigsaw' to find out who is carrying on the deadly game.  Their prime suspect is Jigsaw's ex wife Jill (Betsy Russell - Saw III) who may have essential information on Jigsaw's latest apprentice.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFlashbacks give us an insight into why Jigsaw began his murderous trail in the first place.  We see some of the criminals and victims from the previous movies and see the reason why Jigsaw felt he needed to teach them a lesson.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSaw IV ties up more of the story than its predecessors but not forgetting the usual blood, gore and shock fest, which is what this franchise is famous for.  Saw IV does not, however, evoke an emotional tie with the victims as in Saw III and the link between the victims was not as effective as in the last movie.  Another flaw is the fact that Jigsaw's new apprentice in this movie is not really explored deeply and we have no understanding for his motive in joining the gory game.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFans of the Saw movies will no doubt be intrigued to see this movie and those looking for blood and guts will not be disappointed.  Other than the back story on Jigsaw's motivations, this fourth installment fails to add anything new to the already bloodsoaken franchise. \r\n</p>	2	2011-03-26	502	2011-03-26
503	1	16	\N	The Darjeeling Ltd	<p>\r\nThe Darjeeling Limited opens with a short feature film centred in a hotel room with one of the movie's main characters Jack (Jason Schwartzman - Marie Antoinette) and his ex-girlfriend played by Natalie Portman (V for Vendetta).\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe main feature follows the reunion of three brothers who have not spoken to each other for over a year.  After a near death experience elder brother Francis (Owen Wilson - The Wedding Crashers) decides it is time for the brothers to rekindle their sibling love.  He arranges to meet Jack and Peter (Adrien Brody - King Kong) on The Darjeeling Limited train to embark on a spiritual journey across India. \r\n</p><p>\r\nEach brother embarks on the quest leaving behind their own troubles and using a variety of cheap Indian drugs to try and numb the pain or distress they are feeling.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe trio's adventure runs far from smoothly and they are not a big hit with the overzealous train conductor.  The brothers keep stepping on each other's toes and after just a short while together they are already despising each other.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn order to keep sane, Francis keeps in regular radio contact with his assistant Brendan to ensure the trip is following the carefully arranged schedule to the last word and that his big surprise at the end will come together.  Meanwhile, Peter is battling with his own demons and is yearning for some alone time.  Jack, on the other hand, has his eye on the dazzling young train stewardess Rita (Amara Karan - The Bill [TV]) who gives in to lust and throws tradition out of the window.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter leaving a trail of destruction throughout the train, the brothers are thrown off and left in the middle of the desert with just their suitcases for company.  Unbeknown to them this is where their true spiritual quest will begin, which ultimately leads them back to their roots to find their mother (Anjelica Huston - Seraphim Falls).\r\n</p><p>\r\nWilson, Brody and Schwartzman complement each other well as the three brothers from completely different backgrounds and with varying interests in life.  Wilson heads most of the comedy at the beginning of the movie while Brody provides the key deep human emotional element required towards the end.  Schwartzman fits in superbly bang in the middle of these two extremes.\r\n</p><p>\r\nGreat support comes from Sri Lankan newcomer Karan who puts in a worthy performance as the train temptress while Huston is angelic (!) as the boy's holy mother turned nun.  Also watch out for a cameo from usual suspect Bill Murray.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe Darjeeling Limited was an enjoyable movie with superb acting, beautiful scenery and an engaging story.  Watch out for the jump from one extreme emotion to the next.  One minute you will be laughing, the next you'll be close to tears, the usual you can expect from a Wes Anderson movie.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFans of The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and The Royal Tenenbaums are sure to enjoy this movie.\r\n</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	503	2011-03-26
504	1	20	\N	Elizabeth - The Golden Age	\r\n<p>\r\nBack in 1998 a film called <i>Elizabeth</i> charted the early years of Queen Elizabeth I, the virgin queen and the struggle to assert herself as head of state. The film was beautifully shot and even won an Oscar (if only for makeup), and was nominated for six more. </p><p>\r\nSet shortly after Elizabeth, <i>Elizabeth - The Golden Age</i>, continues the story of Elizabeth centering on the turbulent times surrounding the Babington plot and the attack of the Spanish Armada. </p><p>\r\nMy history is hazy and the film suggests captive Catholic Queen Mary Stuart (Mary Queen of Scots) conspired to assassinate Elizabeth. When the conspiracy was exposed by Elizabeth's chief intelligence officer, Lord Walsingham, Mary was tried and executed for treason.  The apparent murder of catholic Mary, combined with the English habit of raiding Spanish gold ships, helped fuel Spain's long planned invasion of Britain. </p><p>\r\nAs you can imagine there is a lot more to these events than can ever be presented in a two hour movie and many will debate the veracity of the film's depiction of these events. Forgetting that for a moment, few will deny that the execution of Mary Stuart, ultimately a decision made by Elizabeth I, and the subsequent attack of the Spanish Armada, cemented Elizabeth's place in history. </p><p>\r\nReturning to the role that gave her an Oscar nomination for Best Actress, Cate Blanchett (The Good German) is utterly astounding as Elizabeth. In a career that already includes some very strong performances Blanchett goes a step further in this latest film emanating strength and fragility. She brings to life a woman struggling with the burden of responsibility during a myriad of personal attacks mixed with the underlying needs of a woman ultimately isolated from humanity and her need for love and friendship. </p><p>\r\nProviding weighty support, Geoffrey Rush (Pirates of the Caribbean 3) returns as Lord Francis Walsingham, the Queen's trusted advisor who has the unpopular job of interrogating treasonous relatives and announcing the approach of invading armadas. This seemingly sidelined character actually gets a few tender moments confronting conspirators and preparing a Queen for war. Yet another great performance from Rush. </p><p>\r\nBefore this sounds all doom and gloom coated in chintz and gold lace, there is an added dash of spice and sexual tension in the form of newly returned Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen - Shoot 'em Up). </p><p>\r\nSurrounded by royal suitors Elizabeth finds socialising a bit dull until this rough adventurer with good looks and a dash of wit captures her imagination. The virile explorer brings a much needed breath of fresh air to the proceedings. Slowly Sir Walter gains friendship with the frosty Queen and helps her find some escape from the endless formality of the court but at a small price, people do talk after all. </p><p>\r\nClive Owen, with his ever growing fan base of female admirers, was a good choice for the role. Not too young as to be unconvincing, very English, and with a hint of roughness, Owen fits the role well. Even if he is acted off screen by his co-stars, his sex appeal and wide appeal will surely help this movie at the box office. </p><p>\r\n<i>Elizabeth - The Golden Age</i> is a wonderful film and beautifully shot. It follows on well from its predecessor and had a great response from the audience when I went to see it. The costumes and sets, the conspiracies and challenges, all lead towards the eventual attack of the armada. Alas now we hit the weak spot, the armada. With such a fantastic build up to one of history's most famous naval confrontations the expectation was really high and great as it was, this finale wasn't as memorable as hoped and does portray Raleigh as single handedly saving Britain, probably not true. </p><p>\r\nDespite that one quibble, this is a fantastic film. I would award it four stars for the acting of Blanchett alone before I even consider the great sets, the costumes, make up and sheer opulence. I strongly recommend this film for fans of historical and costume dramas.</p>\r\n\r\n	4	2011-03-26	504	2011-03-26
507	1	23	Holocaust forgery feature is the genuine article	The Counterfeiters	<p>Two well clothed, healthy men are playing ping pong. The sound of marching feet from outside the wooden fence of their compound ceases at the noise of an exhausted prisoner dropping to the ground. The game stops as a pistol is cocked; mercy is cried for; a shot rings out. This chilling and true scene sums up what makes <i>The Counterfeiters</i> such a disturbing story. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe two privileged ping-pong players - master forger Salomon Sorowitsch (Karl Markovics) and printer Adolf Burger (August Diehl) - and the unfortunate, unseen victim are all Jews, they are just separated by a set of skills. Because they are vital components in the Nazi plot to forge the allies' currencies, they live a life of relative luxury remote from the camp's horrors. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWriter/director Stefan Ruzowitzky gives a moving and innovative take on the holocaust by showing events exclusively from the perspective of a set of prisoners who are selected for, at least temporary, survival. Those in the so called 'golden cage' of the forging lab have to witness the systematic slaughter through snippets heard and glimpsed outside the compound, making it all the more chilling. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAlthough <i>Schindler's List</i> also deals with similar themes, it has a broader, more epic sweep than Ruzowitzky's film. The Counterfeiters is all the more effective for focusing on one specific group of prisoners and mainly confining events to claustrophobic interiors. \r\n</p><p>\r\nRuzowitzky's brilliant scripting - adapted from Adolf Burger's account of his experience in the camp - presents two main immediate reactions to their predicament of forced collaboration. Burger is every inch the upstanding idealist who wants to sabotage the operation, whereas the cynical Sorowitsch thinks, at least initially, only of his own survival. The initial conflict and gradual unity of these two fascinating characters is the relationship at the heart of The Counterfeiters. \r\n</p><p>\r\nKarl Markovics gives a masterful performance as the charismatic Sorowitsch, whose cold exterior masks a capacity for selflessness. Diehl also excels as the noble Burger. But stealing the show is Devid Striesow, as SS camp commander Friedrich Herzog. He may save the lives of "his Jews", as he puts it, but this opportunistic Nazi is no Oscar Schindler. His chubby, rosy-cheeked, clean-shaven visage and ominously cheery demeanour mask a man willing to go to any lengths for personal gain. His character also provides bold moments of gallows humour. See Herzog, resplendent in preppy whites topped off with a cravat, greeting a dishevelled Sorowitsch with a cheery "bit cold isn't it"; or proposing the death of five men if the dollar isn't forged, then casually suggesting an in-camp carnival. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAs well as penning a superb script, Stefan Ruzowitzky shoots The Counterfeiters with a roaming camera and an eye for a killer edit. One inspired cut shifts from Solomon, alone in a post-war Monaco restaurant, to him in the late 1930s surrounded in a seedy Berlin club, but ironically even more alone as a Jew. The use of sound is also very effective. Lesser directors would have sentimentalised proceedings with maudlin strings, but Ruzowitzky opts for mainly natural backing, punctuated with bursts of lazy accordion. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThere are also a couple of phenomenal moments when background noise cuts out entirely as the trauma of the situation momentarily deafens Solomon. These deft little touches are the mark of an exceptional filmmaker fulfilling the potential of his earlier work. The Counterfeiters is one of 2007's best films and a fitting tribute to those who lost their lives in the horrors it depicts and warns against.\r\n</p>\r\n	5	2011-03-26	507	2012-03-08
510	1	12	\N	War	<p>\r\nA good idea wasted; there are a lot of things wrong with this movie. Sticking with the positive the story has some good ideas. Based on a role playing game that expanded into comics and novels, the story is set in a future dystopia where countries have faded to be replaced by mega-corporations that war for the world's dwindling resources. During one such bloody skirmish the warring sides accidentally crack an ancient stone seal and awaken an evil machine.\r\n</p><P>\r\nThe machine converts people into hyper violent and relentless mutants and the fragmented remnants of humanity do not have the muscle to stop this new enemy. Stepping up to the challenge is a mysterious priest from a remote monastery that has guarded the secrets of the evil machine for hundreds of years. The priest, Brother Samuel (Ron Perlman - Hellboy 2), gets approval from a doomed mega-corporation president to lead a small group of soldiers into the heart of the machine and destroy it once and for all.\r\nSo you can sort of guess the rest, the small band of fearless soldiers get picked off one by one as they slowly make their way to the movie's climax. \r\n</p><P>\r\nYou would like to think that a story with elements such as a shattered future earth, a massive subterranean mutant making machine, an army of zombie-like mutants, should be a sure fire hit. The movie has a good deal of visual flair ranging from the WW1-style trench battle at the beginning and the remote monastery but all this is wasted. \r\nThe good elements of the story are skimmed over to try and engage the audience with action elements that don't actually deliver. The stylisation often veers to excess leaving any good elements lost in an over abundance of scenery. Then to hammer another nail in the coffin, the story has more holes in it than one of the numerous bullet strewn corpses that litter the movie.\r\n</p><P>\r\nThe action takes so long to get going that when it does the movie has to deliver something astounding to win redemption. Unfortunately it doesn't deliver, the action wasn't original and the few set pieces were set too far apart. Add to this the lack of any substantial characters this film just doesn't connect. An attempt to give each soldier a niche personality fell flat as there were too many people and by the time we meet the motley crew they were lined up for the slaughter. The only characters given a bit of depth are Brother Samuel, as the clich wise leader and the resigned Mitch (Thomas Jane - The Punisher), who looks like he has walked straight off <i>The Punisher</i> set into this failed flick.\r\n</p><P>\r\nUltimately this was a good idea for a science fiction action movie that could have spawned a franchise but with naff action and no real characters this movie crashes. It is an action movie as emaciated and hopeless as the future world it portrays.\r\n</p>	1	2011-03-26	510	2011-03-26
512	1	20	\N	Planet Terror	<p>\r\nDirectors Quentin Tarantino (Kill Bill) and Robert Rodriguez (Sin City) have had a long friendship and last year the two controversial directors decided to make a good old fashioned double bill movie spectacular called </i>Grindhouse</i>.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe first movie in the double was Tarantino's <i>'Death Proof'</i> about a homicidal stunt car driver who likes to taunt and kill beautiful groups of girls with his stunt car. The second film 'Planet Terror' was Rodriguez's gory celebration of B-Movie schlock horror. </p><p>\r\nWhen 'Grindhouse' opened in the US it performed incredibly badly much to the shame of both Tarantino and Rodriguez who had both toasted box office success in their more recent movies. After the poor performance in America it was decided to split the films and present them independently in the UK. </p><p>\r\n\r\n'Death Proof' opened to mixed reviews and managed a modest take at the UK box office. I found the movie a great laugh and really did enjoy the high octane finale. Now, a few weeks later the second feature has arrived oozing zombie slime. </p><p>\r\n\r\nI would like to tell you a little about the story but there really is not much to harp on about. It's a madcap adventure set in nowhere America where a small town is suddenly beset upon by a flesh mutating illness converting the public into rabid zombies. Caught in the carnage are a former stripper, her mysterious hyper violent ex, a creaky sheriff, and a bisexual doctor trying to escape her evil husband. </p><p>\r\n\r\nAlong the way there is tonnes of blood, severed testicles, sauce recipes, water bed sex, and a heavily armed and loaded prosthesis. This is stupidity at the extreme but for all its OTT anarchy it isn't that funny to be out and out spoof comedy. This homage to naff B-Movies is the lesser of the Grindhouse double bill but still worthy of attention. </p><p>\r\n\r\nGo watch this if you want a laugh and can remember the gory fun of <i>'Braindead'</i>, <i>'Tremors'</i>, <i>'Piranha'</i> and at a push, the far superior <i>'Shaun of the Dead'</i>.  \r\n	3	2011-03-26	512	2011-03-26
494	1	23	Vampire epic is no toothless sequel	Day Watch	<p>It takes a film of rare brilliance to merge a trailblazing commitment to originality and visual aesthetic with commercial success. Kazakhstan-born Timur Bekmambetov's breakthrough movie <i>Night Watch</i> (2004) was such a film. This twisted tale of vampires, wizards and shape-shifters in modern day Moscow took a cool $40 million at the Russian box office while being one of the most breathtakingly fresh cinema experiences of the 2000s. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe sequel <i>Day Watch</i> sees Bekmambetov continuing to fuse his influences in western action cinema with art-house sensibilities and Russian culture to better his remarkable original. Things pick up a year after the end of the first film, as the forces of good and evil struggle to retain balance in the face of the emergence of a vastly powerful figure on each side, hero Anton's (Konstantin Khabensky) son Yegor (Dima Martynov) on the dark and his partner Svetlana (Maria Poroshina) on the light. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhat makes <i>Day Watch</i> such an experience is the combination of the grandiose, the bombastic and the grotesque with an earthy sense of the day-to-day reality of the people of Moscow. We'll see Anton swilling and sloshing dark beer in a run-down Uzbek restaurant or father and son vampires kidding around while they wash their clothes in a tiny flat. Then suddenly the garishly upholstered Alisa (Russian pop-star Zhanna Friske) is driving a blood red sports car across the vertical face of the hotel hide-out of arch dark other Zavulon (Victor Verzhbitskiy); or thousands of bouncing balls are bringing the city to the brink of an apocalypse. \r\n</p><p>\r\nEven the subtitles are a visual feast, showing more creative spirit than most films muster in their entirety. They vibrate; turn red to indicate death; green when Anton wants a mint as his plane takes off; or dissolve like chalk. It's the loving attention to detail with every tiny element of the film that makes it such an experience. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe blood flow out of budding vampire Kostya's (Aleksey Chadov) eyes as his father pulls him back; or the twisted movement of a witch's spider/rubber doll pet; are just as staggering as a Ferris wheel crashing through the Moscow streets; the Ostankino Tower exploding; or the opening recreation of legendary Mongol general Tamberlane storming an Uzbek fortress. \r\n</p><p>\r\nQuite where Timur Bekmambetov can go from here, both in terms of plot and quality, with the proposed final installment in the trilogy remains to be seen. If he keeps upping the standards then it'll round off the finest series of fantasy films ever made. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIn short this fanged masterpiece goes right for the jugular. Combining the gritty with the fantastical, Timur Bekmambetov's <i>Night Watch</i> follow-up is bold, bloody and brash filmmaking by a phenomenal talent.\r\n</p><p>	5	2011-03-26	494	2012-03-08
517	1	20	\N	The Golden Compass	<p>\r\nMany people around the world have problems with America for one reason or another. Foreign policy or culture decimation by corporate branding definitely provides dinner party debate but my annoyance is their distorted adaptations of much loved books to satisfy a small but easily offended American market.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn a truly momentous example of irony 'The Golden Compass', a book about a world ruled over by a dominant religious mob, has been stripped of religious references by a movie industry trying to appease a dominating religious mob. The result of this hefty rewriting of a much loved and influential story has left many fans apprehensive of this movie and sorry to say many of their fears have been realised.\r\n</p><p>\r\n'The Golden Compass' is based on the Philip Pullman book 'The Northern Lights' (name changed due to Americans not 'getting it'), and follows a young heroine called Lyra who sets off on an adventure to rescue her friend who has been kidnapped by some shady government types. \r\n</p><p>\r\nLyra (Dakota Blue Richards) is an orphan living at an Oxford college where she thwarts an attempt on her uncle's life and is rewarded by a glimpse of his experiments in the far north.  Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig - Invasion) is an adventurer who believes he has found a way to cross into parallel worlds. His ideas are heresy, hence the assassination attempt, but he proceeds anyway winning the admiration of his niece. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSoon after Asriel's departure Lyra is visited by the beautiful Ms Coulter (Nicole Kidman - Invasion) who lures her away to a life of luxury in London. As Lyra prepares to leave Oxford she is given a gift, a golden compass, by her mentor. He explains that the compass allows the owner to find truth and advises Lyra to keep the compass secret suggesting he knows that she is set for an adventure. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSure enough when she gets to London Lyra soon learns that the lovely Ms Coulter is actually rather evil and has something to do with several kidnappings. Lyra realises her friends in Oxford have been snatched and taken north and so sets off on her adventure to rescue them.  Along the way we learn about Lyra's world and meet some interesting characters including a nomadic tribe of Gyptians (gypsies), armored polar bears, mysterious witches, and of course some nasty Magisterum types.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe story is set in a parallel world where people's souls are external tangible animals that follow their hosts and offer advice. These souls, or daemons, are fixed in adulthood when an individual's personality coalesces but often change during childhood innocence. Here we tap on the meat of the matter, innocence.\r\n</p><p>\r\nLyra's world is ruled by an all powerful religious body called the Magisterum that suppresses free voice and freedom of thought. Debating religion, the nature of sin, the possibility of other worlds, or even contradicting the Magisterum is heresy and they will stop at nothing to suppress such actions.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nDue to the very strong Christian community in America, the only important box office, according to certain studio executives, the movie makers were told to remove all mention of religion and Christianity from the film. This basically removes the soul from the storyline echoing one of the harrowing scenes toward the end of both the book and the movie. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe movie therefore has some problems. Also as this is the first of three books, the story and action take quite a while to get going making this film too slow for a new audience. Luckily when we do finally get to see some action the film really does kick things up a gear but by then many an audience has tuned out or lost interest. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThis film had great promise but struggles to succeed over the hurdles set by the studio and the short running time. On the plus side the special effects are very impressive as is the atmosphere of Lyra's world. The action that dominates the final third of the movie is well choreographed and may be just enough to win a return audience if and when the sequel is made. Sadly the film suffers two serious blows by angering fans of the book with its numerous absences and by being too slow for newcomers.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWith regard to acting, the only people to shine out are Nicole Kidman as the mysterious yet evil Ms Coulter and the young Ms Dakota Blue Richards as Lyra, a headstrong and tenacious little girl who persists with her quest despite the numerous problems (mirroring her nemesis Ms Coulter).\r\n</p><p>\r\nIf you loved the books and have an open mind this is still an entertaining movie even if it ends five minutes too early.  If you've never read the books but enjoy fantasy adventures like the recent <i>'Stardust'</i>, then this may hold your attention and reward your patience. However if you are looking for the new <I>Harry Potter</i> or a replacement for <I>Lord of the Rings</i>, this falls far short of both franchises.\r\n</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	517	2011-03-26
521	1	8	\N	I Am Legend	<p>\r\nSet barely four years in the future, I Am Legend is the story of one man's quest for survival in a world which has seen most of humanity wiped out by a man-made virus. Based on the Richard Matheson novel of the same name, it is the third incarnation having been preceded by <i>'The Last Man On Earth'</i> (1964) and <i>'The Omega Man'</i> (1971). \r\n</p><p>\r\nWill Smith (The Pursuit of Happyness) plays Robert Neville, a brilliant military scientist living in a deserted New York City. With just his loyal dog Sam as his only companion, he strives to find a cure for a synthetic plague that has decimated the population. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThis is a film of two parts, the first immensely effective, thought-provoking and, at times, harrowing. Striking cinematography (by Andrew Lesnie, who worked on The Lord of The Rings) evokes an eerie, yet beautiful, version of New York. It is bathed in sunlight, overrun by nature and virtually silent - the polar opposite of the bustling Big Apple as we know it. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe introduction of Smith's character contrasts this city-wilderness, as he roars onto the screen in a showy sports car to hunt venison. After three years with no human contact, he is a man teetering on the brink of sanity as he fights to survive. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSmith is quite simply outstanding as the only principal character in the film. He delivers a restrained and yet powerful performance as the 'last man on earth'. Watching his interactions with Sam and various shop mannequins is heart rendering, uncomfortable, amusing and utterly captivating. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThrough the effective use of clever flashbacks we are shown how mankind came to reach this grim conclusion. They also serve to emphasis Neville's seclusion and isolation as he clings to the fading hope that he can turn the tide on the virus. However, it all seems to come apart as night falls. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe 'dark seekers' (or virus induced, blood thirsty mutants) are disappointing. Poor CG creations, they fall far short of expectation and are nowhere near the menacing threat they should be. Coupled with some heavy-handed moral messages (via Bob Marley) and a religious undertone that is suddenly introduced in the final act, and the film falters to a stuttering finish. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIt is an unfortunate end to a film which promised, and for the first two-thirds delivered, so much. Despite this, it is still a decent effort. Thought-provoking, touching and troubling, I Am Legend is well worth a look. Whether it matches up to Matheson's acclaimed 1954 book I can't say, but it has certainly inspired me to seek out a copy at my local bookshop.\r\n</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	521	2011-03-26
522	1	16	\N	PS I Love You	<p>\r\nThe film opens with the early days of marital bliss ranging from misunderstandings, family secrets and work pet peeves all ending up in 'make up' sex.\r\n</p><p>\r\nHolly (Hilary Swank - The Reaping) and Gerry (Gerard Butler - 300) are just a normal couple who have their fair share of arguments and disagreements.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBut tragedy strikes and Gerry is passes away from a brain tumour.  It knocks Holly for six and if it wasn't for her family and close friends she would have dropped deeper into depression and grief. Even though Gerry is gone he hasn't left her life completely.  Having prepared in advance, he sends a series of letters to Holly to help her carry on with her life.\r\n</p><p>Her best friends Denise (Lisa Kudrow - Friends [TV]) and Sharon (Gina Gershon - Rescue Me [TV]) are on hand to help Holly pull through.  Holly's mother (Kathy Bates - Fred Claus) just wants her daughter to deal with her grief and be happy again while her male buddy Daniel (Harry Connick Jr - Mickey) is around to offer a shoulder to cry on but also has his eye on her too.\r\n</p><p>On Holly's 30th birthday she receives the first letter from 'beyond the grave' and from then on she proceeds to follow every single word of advice from Gerry.  \r\n</p><p>She goes out partying with her friends and tackles some of the things in life that she would never normally do.  Holly and her girlfriends even take a trip to Gerry's homeland for a spot of man watching and girlie fun.\r\nBut how long can Holly keep Gerry alive through his letters before she starts to neglect her friends and family and let it take over her life?  Will she ever find love again?\r\n</p><p>Swank is superb as the young widow who lets her hair down once in a while but finds it hard to deal with the sudden loss of her beloved husband.  Butler is fantastic as the eye candy putting in a rough and sexy performance as the loving husband.  Praise must also go to Bates for her strong motherly role and to Kudrow for her Phoebe-esque quips.\r\n</p><p><i>'PS I Love You'</i> is the best romantic comedy I have seen for a long time.  It is a real tear jerker, the emotional strength of this film is just amazing.  Fans of the Cecelia Ahern book will not be disappointed.  If you loved <i>'In Her Shoes'</i> and <i>'The Lake House'</i> you should enjoy this movie.  \r\n	4	2011-03-26	522	2011-03-26
523	1	20	\N	Charlie Wilsons War	<p>\r\nThree big name stars come together for a political drama. Sounds almost like 'Lions for Lambs' doesn't it? But whereas the Robert Redford flick took morality head on in a trio of situational debates, this film uses good old satire and wit to punch home its message. \r\n</p><p>\r\nBack in the latter days of the cold war the west seemingly cared little for the plight of Afghanistan. The country of Afghanistan, on the edge of the USSR, was under attack from the red army and millions of Afghans were forced to live in refugee camps. The only thing in the red army's way was the rebel mujahideen, poorly armed and heavily outnumbered. \r\n</p><p>\r\nEnter into this political debate a hard drinking Texan congressman who likes to jacuzzi with Vegas show girls and has an overactive libido. Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks - The Da Vinci Code) was the congressman who picked up on the human atrocities in Afghanistan and decided to do something about it. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAs Charlie starts to investigate the Afghan problem he finds help in all manner of places, most notably a disaffected CIA agent, Gust (Philip Seymour Hoffman - MI3). Gust is a veteran and a man who knows his job but he is constantly sidelined by his younger managers and peers who have the fancy degrees. When fate leads him into Charlie Wilson's office, these two bullish blokes soon hit it off. \r\n</p><p>\r\nTo gain further support and leverage Charlie Wilson also falls in with an old flame, and tyrannical socialite named Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts - Charlotte's Web). Joanne, like both Charlie and Gust, doesn't mince words and although time may march on it doesn't wither her wits or her charm as she spins the wheels to help Charlie's mission. \r\n</p><p>\r\nCharlie Wilson's War is based on the true story of a ballsy Texan congressman who negotiated US funding of the mujahideen and consequently helped Afghanistan force out the red army and claim independence. So far so good, this is an interesting and often amusing glance at the American political system highlighting its strengths and weaknesses and offering insight into a debatable piece of history. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe historical accuracy of the film can be debated by experts but no one can deny that the current US foreign policy in Afghanistan is a political hot potato so this film offers a nice witty glance at how the mess all began. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDirected by Mike Nichols (Closer), this film tells a grand tale yet doesn't let events lead you away from the characters and as a result we connect better with the unlikely trio who helped reshape the world. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe three big names heading this movie are all uniformly great. Hanks reminds us of his comedy routes with some great timing and line delivery while Hoffman gets a chance to don the worst facial hair and glasses combo in a decade and verbally kick ass as the 'call a spade a f#'king spade' CIA agent. \r\n</p><p>\r\nOne nice surprise was Julia Roberts who has been fading from the limelight and who I have accused of being a bit 'samey' in many of her films. It was good to see her repair the damage that was her performance in 'Closer' with this turn as a determined social tyrant whose advancing years do not detract from her charm. \r\n</p><p>\r\nFunny yet meaningful, satirical but more amazingly based on true events, this is a unique and entertaining political movie. I would recommend this movie to fans of political satires such as <i>'Dr Strangelove'</i> and <i>'Three Kings'</i>, but would also recommend it for fans of political dramas such as <i>'Syriana'</i> and <i>'Rendition'</i>.\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	523	2011-03-26
524	1	20	\N	Beowulf	<p>\r\nIn the dark ages a savage monster named Grendel (Crispin Glover - Charlie's Angels) attacks the kingdom of Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins - Fractured), a once noble king who is now a drunken old man weighed down by secret woes. Besieged by the monster Hrothgar calls for heroes to help slay the monster and fearless warrior Beowulf (Ray Winstone - The Departed) answers the summons.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBeowulf receives a frosty greeting from the king's closest counsel, Unferth (John Malkovich - Eragon), but after a particularly interesting naked tussle with Grendel , and the subsequent death of the monster, Beowulf is hailed as a hero. Sadly the celebrations are short lived as Grendel's mother (Angelina Jolie - The Good Shepherd) seeks revenge and makes Beowulf a rather inviting offer, the full horror of which will not be revealed until Beowulf is an old man reminiscent of drunken Hrothgar.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBased on the classic olde English poem that runs for over three thousand lines, transforming Beowulf into a feature length movie less than two hours long was always going to be a challenge.  Then again Wolfgang Peterson tried to squeeze the twenty eight books of Homer's Iliad into just under three hours and, although much debated, he managed to cram quite a lot in. \r\n</p><p>\r\nHaving never read any olde English poems the adventure was new to me so I cannot say if it is accurate or not to the original source material*. The monsters are imaginative and convincingly threatening, the action is fast paced and fairly intense, add to this some great humour and loads of suggestive CGI and you get a great movie.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe animation in this movie is very highly detailed with characters very closely resembling their vocal actors. The texture of clothing, the sea, and the ever abundant fire highlight the animation team's attention to detail. More importantly the mature content makes a welcome change to mainly eastern dominated "grown up" animation genre, and Beowulf is certainly not one for the little kiddies. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThere is quite a bit of CGI flesh on show and many a cheeky line of dialogue mixed in with gruesome violence. It's probably no worse than your average playground but for the sake of political correctness (rescue us from the do-gooder police) this is not recommended for young children and parents should be aware of the film's content. \r\n</p><p>\r\nReturning to the review, I'd seriously recommend this film for fans of Vikings (although these are Danes, not Vikings), shameless macho action, animation, fantasy and Angelina Jolie in the buff. Not as epic a movie as say <i>'LOTR'</i> but definitely a whole lot better than woeful <i>'Pathfinder'</i>, this is a good heroic story with the solid message "no sin goes unpunished". \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</p><p>\r\n*For those who are interested in accuracy after doing some swift research on the web I am happy to say that many key sequences and character names have been retained albeit with a bit of modern reinterpretation. Leaving that aside this is still a cracking movie and if it gets a few people interested in the original all well and good. Any classics experts out there that take serious umbrage please remember most people have never heard of the poem Boewulf let alone read it.\r\n</p>	4	2011-03-26	524	2011-03-26
491	1	20	Fast cars, hot pants, murder and dirty dialogue.... Welcome back Mr Tarantino	Death Proof	<p>In 1968 there was a movie thriller released call <i>"Bullitt"</i> starring Steve McQueen. The film became an instant classic even though most people can't even remember the story. What they remember is the car chase. There had been many films with car chases but Bullitt added a reality that really got the blood pumping and even now is considered one of the best car chases ever put to screen.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter <i>"Bullitt"</i> there was a spate of car chase movies that were not always cinema gold but gained a cult following nonetheless. Since then the car chase has been an integral part of any action movie and over the years has become, to an extent, expected. To honour this crucial and enjoyable action component piece, and those seventies movies, Mr Tarantino presents his latest movie homage.\r\n</p><p>\r\nLacking any real storyline the loose plot centres on a creepy stunt driver who stalks groups of pretty girls before killing them with his stunt car. That's about it for story. The film is fleshed out with some catchy dialogue between the girls allowing us time to get to know them before their eventual confrontation with the madman. The dialogue, as you can expect, is full of great lines sure to become the stuff of cult recitation and the characters are instantly cool even if slutty, dizzy, naive or unbalanced.\r\n</p><p>\r\n<b>Stuntman Mike: <i>There are few things as fetching as a bruised ego on a beautiful angel.</b></i>\r\n</p><p>\r\nSo, why does it get four stars? The preceding paragraph suggests that this is nothing more than a gang of girls talking tosh, occasionally interrupted by high speed death and carnage. It is, but it's great fun, well shot and has some fantastic stunts and car chases. \r\n</p><p>\r\nPacked with Tarantino's usual bucket load of subtle movie references, cool cat characters, and a great soundtrack I was instantly content to watch the movie unfold and was gripped in the final confrontational showdown. Fans of more conventional movies may find their concentration wander in the meandering dialogue and ponder where things are going but their patience will be rewarded with lap dances, severed limbs, smash ups and cold hearted revenge. \r\n</p><p>\r\nOn the acting front Kurt Russell (Sky High) returns to his action man persona of yesteryear and reminds us that he can be funny, scary, tough and vulnerable all at the same time. Meanwhile, filling the hot pants are a whole heap of sexy ladies including the ever beautiful Rosario Dawson (Clerks II), Sydney Tamiia Poitier (Grey's Anatomy [TV]), Rose McGowan (The Black Dahlia), Jordan Ladd (Waiting), Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Factory Girl) and Vanessa Ferlito (Man of the House) among many more. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDeliberately poor editing, colour saturation and cheesy opening credits help make the movie feel like a cheap seventies flick and the thin plot adds to that perception but despite these often clumsy tricks this is still a good laugh. It's not Shakespeare, it's not even that scary, but it is fun. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThis film is recommended for fans of great car chases and Tarantino's style. So, I'd recommend this for script fans of <i> 'Kill Bill'</i> and <i>'Pulp Fiction'</i>, and car chase fans of <i>'Bullitt'</i>, <i>'Death Race 2000'</i>, <i>The French Connection</i>, <i>'Ronin'</i> and the original <i>'Italian Job'</i>. \r\n</p>	4	2011-03-26	491	2012-03-08
526	1	23	\N	The Savages	<p>\r\nThree astonishing central performances and a witty script elevate what could have been a dowdy tale of a dysfunctional family into a moving and tentatively hopeful comedy-drama. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe Savages is a skillfully crafted follow up to writer/director Tamara Jenkins' similarly themed debut, The Slums of Beverley Hills, which also follows the fortunes of screwed-up family life. Phillip Seymour Hoffman (Charlie Wilson's War) and Laura Linney (Breach) both excel as estranged siblings John and Wendy Savage, who are forced to re-build their relationship as they have to care for senile father Lenny (Philip Bosco - Freedomland), who they resent. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThese wounded and damaged souls are all isolated within the lives they have attempted to carve out for themselves, but find some sense of hope through their unification as a twisted reflection of a conventional family unit.\r\n </p><p>\r\nAlso, Philip Bosco is magnificent as the simultaneous patriarch and infant of family Savage. His portrayal of an obviously selfish man regressing into childlike senility is one of the finest turns of the year. The sullen silences mixed in with bursts of aggression and lucidity encapsulates the reality of dementia. It is hinted that Hoffman's John bore the brunt of his father's parental inadequacies, but Jenkins' script never over explains the past, it just hints. John's palpable sense of inadequacy and refusal to allow his Polish girlfriend to get close tell their own story. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe small support cast are also excellent, particularly Peter Freidman (Paycheck) as Larry, the gawky married man who uses walks with his Labrador as a pretext to conduct an affair with Wendy. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWriter and director Tamara Jenkins shoots her second full-feature film with a keen visual style. She makes the most of her locations, ranging from the glaring over-exposed sunlight of the surreal Arizona retirement town Lenny has been living in, to the grime and rain of the New York and Buffalo scenes. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAlthough The Savages could do with being a little shorter than close to two hours, this artfully shot, superbly acted and deeply poignant film moves, engages and amuses.\r\n</p>	4	2011-03-26	526	2011-03-26
527	1	4	\N	The Valley of Elah	<p>\r\nThis film tells the story of a young soldier, Mike Deerfield (Jonathan Tucker - Hostage) who on his first weekend back from serving in Iraq goes missing and is reported AWOL. Following a call to his parents from the army, his war veteran father Hank (Tommy Lee Jones - No Country for Old Men) sets out looking for his son, leaving wife Joan (Susan Sarandon - Enchanted) to sit and wait by the phone.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAt the beginning of the film, Hank suddenly and dramatically packed his bags and left after the phone call concerning the whereabouts of his son. This did not make any sense and it was only on reading the synopsis independently that I realised the severity of the situation.  At the time, his actions seemed a little over the top, as there was no need for panic and this was not expressed in the film or the phone call. \r\n</p><p>\r\nReaching the jurisdiction where Mike was last seen, Hank manages to persuade police detective Emily Sanders (Charlize Theron - Aeon Flux) to help in his search. Their seemingly simple investigation of a missing soldier uncovers more 'foul' play than Chicken Run, with cover-ups stemming from Mike's time in Iraq. As the struggle between team Hank and the military to keep control of the case intensifies, Hank reevaluates his entire world and long-held beliefs.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe style of the film was quite quiet, no loud background music, glitzy transitions or action noise, so much so that you could almost hear the film reel rolling in some parts. Also the actor's costumes were pretty grey and dull. I almost didn't recognise Theron, as she looked dowdy and blended into the background. Both these characteristics of the film were used to full effect, enabling the audience to connect with the pain and anguish the characters were going through. And considering the film was inspired by true events, it made this film even more thought provoking.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe title, "In the Valley of Elah" is derived from the biblical story of where David slew Goliath - and thus got-eth the name. At first I couldn't see why the film was so named or what the link was, but it eventually made sense when the tenuous connection was made by Lee Jones telling Theron's son, the aptly named David, about the history of his name. And it was only at the end of the film when Theron repeated the story, of Lee Jones likening the military to Goliath, that the significance of the title made sense. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAlthough the film went on for 2 hours, initially I thought the long drawn-out style of the film, lack of any real action and the grey hue would be boring, but it kept me engrossed the whole way through. Lee Jones was on top form as was Theron, who complimented each other very well. And even though they are both big names, they worked very well together with neither one trying to outshine the other.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFans of <i>The General's Daughter</i>, <i>Rules of Engagement</i> and <i>A Few Good Men</i> are bound to enjoy this harrowing tale.    \r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	527	2011-03-26
528	1	20	\N	Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street	<p>"There's a hole in the world like a great black pit<br>\r\nand the vermin of the world inhabit it<br>\r\nand its morals aren't worth what a pin can spit<br>\r\nand it goes by the name of London." </b><i>Sweeney Todd</i></p>\r\n<p>\r\nTim Burton, the master of gothic fairytale filming, presents his interpretation of "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street", the classic musical by Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe popular musical was itself based upon a traditional horror story originally published in a penny dreadful (an old grizzly comic book). The story tells of a vengeful barber who returns to London after years in exile to claim vengeance upon the men who ruined his life. We learn that the macabre barber was once a fine upstanding man with a lovely wife and a beautiful baby daughter. However the nave young man was framed for a false crime and banished to the colonies while an envious judge moved in on his lovely wife and little girl. </p><p>\r\n\r\nRenaming himself Sweeney Todd, the once honorable barber reclaims his original offices above a nasty bakery shop owned by down on her luck Mrs Lovett. Here he learns that his wife has taken her own life and that his daughter is now the young ward of the vile Judge.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFilled with hate Sweeney starts to form a plan of revenge and soon re-establishes his reputation as a great barber. All too soon his past catches up with him and after violently dispatching a would be blackmailer Sweeney gets his first taste of murder and, with the help of Mrs Lovett, a profitable way to dispose of the bodies. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe body count climbs steadily and soon Sweeney returns to his quest for vengeance and fate offers him a golden chance. By curious luck the young sailor who sailed to London has fallen deeply in love with the ward of the evil Judge. By subtle means, and a lot of bloodshed, Sweeney slowly works his way toward his nemesis but though fate seems to help him, it is also leading him to a tragic end.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThis dark tale filled with blood and fanciful lyrics was ripe material for acclaimed director Tim Burton who has previously excelled with similar macabre musical material such as <i>'The Nightmare Before Christmas'</i> and<i> 'The Corpse Bride'</i>. Sadly Burton's genius works against him here as the stage play doesn't seem to lend itself so well to the big screen. Maybe the expectation was too high with such grand ingredients, the film was great fun but not fantastic.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn the title role, the Burton stalwart Johnny Depp (Pirates of the Caribbean) was an excellent choice. Depp has shown time and time again that he can capture a strange character and make it his own and it's no surprise to see him embody this dark villain. Award worthy? Maybe, but we'll have to see. With such a powerful lead performance someone special was needed for the role of Mrs Lovett and so Burton called on his partner, Helena Bonham Carter (Charlie & the Chocolate Factory) who once again rose to the occasion. She can be sweet and she can be scary and I was quite surprised to hear she can sing so well. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe wealth of acting talent, the strong story, and the visionary director should have resulted in cinema gold but this just didn't hit the mark. Good fun and dripping bright red blood, it did raise a chuckle and a fair few shudders but it isn't a career best from one of my favourite directors. \r\n</p><p>\r\nRecommended for fans of musical movies and dark stories. \r\n\r\n	4	2011-03-26	528	2011-03-26
532	1	20	\N	Cloverfield	<p>\r\nOut of an ocean of misinformation, teaser websites and countless nerd forums has finally emerged a huge beast of a movie devouring all competition in its wake. Finally <b>"Cloverfield"</b> has arrived and it's angry (for a romance)!\r\n</p><p>\r\nFilmed entirely using household digital camcorders the film begins as a mockumentary at a party for Rob (Michael Stahl-David - The Black Donnellys [TV]), a young exec who is shortly leaving for a new career in Japan. You know the kind of party where someone thrusts a camera in your face and says "say something great about Rob" and you stutter for a few moments. Anyway, at the party we meet Rob's brother Jason, his girlfriend, and a few other friends including briefly the beautiful Beth (Odette Yustman - Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story), Rob's friend and recent lover who arrives with a different guy!\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter a small spat Beth leaves with her temporary boyfriend while Rob, Jason and camera guy "Hud" go and sit on a fire escape. Rob is clearly in love but conflicted and his friends try to console him. This tender moment is shattered by an earthquake and a black out. After a few moments of panic our party people get the power back on and decide to head up onto the roof to see if they can see what caused the quake. A huge explosion downtown and flying debris filling the sky suggests that they should all make a run for it. Outside on the street they are greeted by the decapitated head of the Statue of Liberty thrown over arm a couple of miles away by some unseen force of nature.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFrom then on the film basically goes hyper. It soon becomes apparent that some massive sea beasty is tearing the city apart destroying buildings and killing all those in its path. Rob and his friends try to escape the mayhem but on the verge of safety Rob hesitates. He has received a voicemail from Beth; she is alive but trapped in her apartment block across town and she is bleeding badly. \r\n</p><p>\r\nRob decides to head back into Manhattan to rescue his love and some of his friends, emotionally shattered by the already nasty events, lose sight of logic and agree to stay with him. As they try to travel through the big apple these few survivors get a close look at their nemesis and have many dark and grizzly adventures leading toward an emotional climax.\r\n</p><p>\r\nHud keeps filming as our heroes try to stay alive in a world turned on its head. Filled with post 9/11 imagery and some great stirring performances you can't help but connect with the characters even though you know this is nothing but a modern stylish B-movie. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe cast is filled with relative unknowns and the evil leviathan and its smaller pals are only glimpsed briefly for a majority of the movie making the film feel more real and obviously keeping the production costs down. A number of cryptic websites and a great wave of web based hype have built this film up and now it's here it really delivers.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe plot is simple, we have all seen it before; a group of pretty people are thrown into a "flee for your life" horror and are plucked off one at a time by many evils. Despite this thin premise, the film delivers so much energy, tension, and excitement that it easily surpasses any of its peers.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThink <i>'Godzilla'</i> genetically mangled with <i> "The Blair Witch Project" </i> and injected with a Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Ultimatum) dose of jerky hand held camera work. Hardly ever heard of newcomer director Matt Reeves has made a cult masterpiece and even if the others rave about JJ Abrams it was the direction and acting that made this movie what it is, a blood soaked mutant masterpiece!\r\n</p> \r\n	4	2011-03-26	532	2011-03-26
533	1	4	\N	Juno	<p><b>Juno</b> is the story of a young girl (Ellen Page - Smart People), who one afternoon while bored, thought she'd lose her virginity to her friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera - SuperBad), who she likes but is not hung up on him. Problem is she accidentally falls pregnant. Deciding to keep the baby, she goes on a mission to find the perfect parents to adopt her unborn child, but this expedition also becomes a journey of self-discovery. \r\n</p><p>\r\nTrawling through the 'Pennysavers' newspaper, Juno settles on the perfect affluent couple, Mark (Jason Bateman - The Kingdom) and Vanessa (Jennifer Garner - The Kingdom). First impressions of the characters in this movie soon change as they develop through the film.  The relationship that Juno builds with the prospective parents eventually helps with her final decision.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWhat Juno learns about from this couple, and the life that is growing inside her, makes her take stock of her relationships and helps her grow into a woman, even though she's still a young teenager with real teenage problems. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThis is a fantastic heart warming story that really makes you think. Juno is a quirky, witty, young non-conformist, and Page plays her fantastically. She has some of the best one-liners which just roll off her tongue and make you laugh.\r\n </p><p>\r\nAn example of Juno's dry wit was when she was commenting on the present from her mother who left her years ago, <i>"Oh, and she inexplicably mails me a cactus every Valentine's Day. And I'm like, "Thanks a heap coyote ugly. This cactus-gram stings even worse than your abandonment."</i>\r\n</p><p>\r\nHer relationship with her father and stepmother help her through the tough times, and it's surprising to see who eventually becomes Juno's "rock".\r\n</p><p>\r\nI absolutely loved this film, and it's not surprising to see it has already been nominated for four Oscars.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIt wasn't your usual cheesy coming-of-age film, where everyone tries to either get laid, or "find themselves" in some sort of deep spiritual way - this film was more natural, and about a sassy young girl who has to grow up pretty fast. It was a very real, gritty British movie, but set in America.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAn absolute must see. You would enjoy this film even more if you like "Get Real" and "Knocked Up".\r\n</p>	4	2011-03-26	533	2011-03-26
534	1	20	\N	Step Up 2 - The Streets	<p>Our screens continue to be saturated by feel-good dance movies and even our television screens have not escaped with the return of the ever-popular <i>Strictly Come Dancing</i>.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe latest venture into the genre is Step Up. Tyler (Channing Tatum - She's The Man) is a degenerate teen who constantly finds himself in trouble and facing a juvenile court judge on a regular basis.\r\n</p><p>\r\nTyler lives at home with his foster parents and siblings but his unfulfilling home life pushes him to spend more time with his hoodlum friends Mac (Damaine Radcliff - Glory Road) and his little brother Skinny (De'Shawn Washington).\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter a night of trespassing and destruction with his mates, Tyler is caught by a security guard and faces the judge yet again. The judge sentences him to serve 200 hours of community service at the scene of the crime, a performing arts school full of "rich kids".\r\n</p><p>\r\nTyler reports to the school's principal Director Gordon (Rachel Griffiths - Six Feet Under [TV]) who assigns him janitor duties. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDuring his stint at the school, Tyler observes from the sidelines the sheer amount of dancing and musical talent among the pupils. He especially takes a fancy to pretty dancer Nora (Jenna Dewan - Take the Lead) who is busy practicising a routine for her showcase piece.\r\n</p><p>\r\nNora's dream is to be a successful dancer and she hopes her showcase will catch the eye of a prestigious dance company. Nora is determined to work hard on her piece and to produce the best showcase possible. Her dance partner is a fellow pupil and, with the support of her boyfriend Brett (Josh Henderson - Yours, Mine and Ours), she is prepared to put in all the necessary training hours to make it a success. Not only does Nora need to get the routine right but she also needs to choose the right backing track and her friend Miles (played by singer Mario) is on hand to deliver the best tune.\r\n</p><p>\r\nJust when everything seems to be running smoothly, Nora's dance partner is forced to pull out of training due to injury. Nora is left in a desperate situation and needs to find a replacement fast. Cue Tyler, an experienced hip-hop dancer, who steps up to take on the challenge. Nora is apprehensive at first but she has seen his moves and decides the risk is worth it.\r\n</p><p>\r\nTyler and Nora spend more and more time together and really start to hit it off. Meanwhile, Mac is putting pressure on Tyler to spend time with him on the basketball court.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter a falling out with Nora over his timekeeping, Tyler decides to give up on the dancing and return to his hoodlum ways. Nora continues dancing solo and Tyler wins back his friend's trust.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIt takes a horrific tragedy to make Tyler realise what is really important in life and he learns that he cannot give up all the time. Tyler has to fight to win back Nora's trust and the pair finally start dancing again and come up with a kick-arse routine.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWill Tyler and Nora make it to the final showcase performance without any other hiccups?\r\n</p><p>\r\nTatum is simply scrumptious and hot as the funky groover while Dewan is on top form again as the dancing queen following her last impressive role as Sasha in <i>Take the Lead</i>. \r\n</p><p>\r\n<b>Step Up</b> is an entertaining movie with impressive dance routines and great chemistry between the leads. Don't expect an original plot, it has been seen soo many times before, but enjoy the rhythms and sexy grooves.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFans of <i>Save the Last Dance</i>, <i>Honey</i> and <i>Take the Lead</i> are sure to love this movie. However, its predecessors were much better movies boasting either greater acting, better dancing or more high profile stars. </p>	4	2011-03-26	534	2011-03-26
535	1	20	\N	Jumper	<p>\r\nWhen I saw that Hayden Christensen (Shattered Glass), the weakest thing in the weak <i>Star Wars</i> prequels, was headlining a new science fiction adventure my hopes were not high. So it was with only limited excitement that I went to see Jumper. I'd like to say it exceeded my low expectations but it'd be a lie, it fell flat.\r\n</p><p>\r\nA dumb teenage lad, David (Max Thieriot - The Pacifier), walks out onto a frozen river and unsurprisingly falls through the ice and then surprisingly teleports to the local library. After discovering his new ability David escapes his boring home town and abusive father to start a new life of luxury. His gift allows him to free banks of their unwanted dosh and enjoy all the fun the world has to offer. Eight years older David is now played by the teenage looking Hayden Christensen\r\n</p><p>Some quick snapshots of him sunbathing on the head of the sphinx and enjoying a drink in a London pub sets the scene before an unwelcome visit from a spoil sport, Roland (Samuel L Jackson - 1408). Roland considers David to be a freak of nature (despite the fact he is the one with the white hair and scary bulging eyes). Luckily David escapes and instead of hiding somewhere sensible he returns to his home town to get reacquainted with an old flame Millie (Rachel Bilson - The OC [TV]) and whisks her off to Rome where she quickly succumbs to his charms.\r\n</p><p>In Rome things briefly get interesting when David meets a fellow jumper, Griffin (Jamie Bell - King Kong), who hints at the reasons why so many maniacs are trying to kill them. However, before that develops into anything interesting the story returns to a classic "save my girlfriend" situation with David doing many a dodgy action caper to try and save his poorly characterised love interest (never seen that before).\r\n</p><p>Possibly interesting hints at David's abusive past, his suspiciously absent and well dressed mother and the motivation of Roland are quickly abandoned in preference for simple leap frogging around the world in a standard chase movie format. The film leaves obvious questions unanswered such as "did none of those tourists notice a man in a deck chair on top of the sphinx?" and "how did David get a six pack when he's so lazy he teleports half a foot to pick up a remote?". Whenever there is a hint of a story the movie quickly runs into a chase scene. It tries very hard to stay dumb and succeeds.\r\n</p><p>The potential for a great science fiction was within its grasp and the ingredients were there but sadly these possibilities were replaced with an adolescent teen drama with a bit of flash scenery.\r\n</p><p>Christensen was as wooden as usual playing David, a character I didn't have much sympathy for (a bank robber who gets into a sulk when someone finds out and tries to stop him) but then again he didn't have much to work with. Bilson was barely better as Millie, the love interest as her character (pretty though she may be) is even harder to connect with. After five years of thinking David is dead she willingly leaps on a plane to Rome with him before jumping in the sack with the plank, all before she's even finished unpacking. Bit of a tart really. Samuel L Jackson was Samuel L  Jackson, don't have to say much more really. In fact the only interesting character was Jamie Bell as rebellious loner Griffin who offers hints at possible stories that ultimately fizzle out.\r\n</p><p>This film is ripe for a sequel, alas, but hopefully any next chapter will actually try to develop some characters and possibly, if we're lucky, a story. Aimed at early teens is no excuse for the slim plot and predictable action sequences. Director Doug Liman, the man behind <i> "The Bourne Identity" </i> a great movie, falls flat on this wet action flick and does little to redeem himself following the similarly weak <i> "Mr & Mrs Smith" </i>. Fingers crossed this once promising director can turn things around or maybe focus on producing rather than calling the shots.  \r\n</p><p>If you like films like <i>X-Men</i>, <i>Spider-Man </i>3, or the TV series <i>Heroes</i>, don't expect anything from this movie. However, if you really need to turn your brain off, and if <i> 'Torchwood'</i> is too heavy for you, then maybe watch this.     \r\n	2	2011-03-26	535	2011-03-26
539	1	4	\N	The Bank Job	<p>\r\nThis conspiracy story stretches from the beaches of the Caribbean to the grey streets of east London. Terry (Jason Statham - War) is a car dealer in east London in the early 1970s, with a healthy sideline in petty crime, a vocation which keeps him and his old neighbourhood chums in contact. Cashing in on this nostalgic relationship, model Martine (Saffron Burrows - The Guitar) returns to the old gang with a fantastic proposal of a "foolproof" bank heist.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn all innocence, the gang embark on the heist of the century, unbeknown to them that they are puppets in a bigger plot, which includes the Royal family and the other dirty secrets of undesirable underground characters from London's seedier side. What started off as a simple bank job turns into deadly cat and mouse game between everyone, from underworld thugs' right through to the higher echelons of the British government. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe story is based on the real Baker Street bank robbery of 1971 where, due to national security and a government gagging order, the real facts have only just been disclosed. Interestingly the loot that was stolen has never been found and the culprits never arrested. Because it was based on a true story, it is real, so not necessarily a feel great, feel good ending.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIt was a great story, and kept me engrossed all the way through. Although Statham seems to have just one way of acting - thug - which he plays well, I just wish he wouldn't try and do emotional scenes as this highlights his wooden side.\r\n</p><p>\r\nPutting David Suchet, better known for his role as Poirot, as Lew Vogel, an underground pimp, was brilliant. To see another side to his character was very amusing and he played the part well, although a little too well, therefore scary at times.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe film is split into two parts - the first half is the actual, straight-forward bank job, and the second half shows the gang trying to get away with their lives intact, while all the baddies fight against each other.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAll very exciting, and a great British film.  If you liked <i>The Italian Job</i> or <i>Buster</i>, you'll love this.\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	539	2011-03-26
541	1	20	\N	National Treasure - Book of Secrets	<p>\r\nNow that bad memories of "Lara Croft - Cradle of Life" have faded and a geriatric Indiana Jones has finally put back in his dentures and picked up his whip, Hollywood is back into treasure hunting. This year there are many archaeologically themed movies in the offing and first up is "National Treasure 2 - Book of Secrets".\r\n</p><p>\r\nSet a few years after the unexpectedly good fun "National Treasure" we find that time and excessive wealth haven't been too kind to our heroes.  Ben Gates (Nicholas Cage - Ghost-Rider) has had a falling out with former squeeze Abigail (Diane Kruger - National Treasure) and is living back at home with grumbling father Patrick (Jon Voight - Transformers). Also Ben's close friend and fellow treasure hunter Riley (Justin Bartha - Failure to Launch) has amassed an enormous tax problem. \r\n</p><p>\r\nBen and his dad are on the lecture circuit following their great discovery and one day an audience member, Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris - A History of Violence) makes a devastating announcement. Wilkinson has in his possession proof that Ben's great great grandfather architected the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. \r\n</p><p>\r\nUnable to accept this shocking revelation Ben is determined to clear the family name and starts to dig into the past. Surprisingly it doesn't take him too long to find a cryptic clue that leads him onto yet another fantastical treasure hunt and Wilkinson is hot on his heels.\r\n</p><p>\r\nTo find the magnificent treasure Ben and Riley head off round the world following the well hidden and ludicrous clues and eventually reach the inevitable impasse. The final clue they need is hidden in a secret book owned by the president and to get at it they have to kidnap the leader of the free world.   \r\n</p><p>\r\nSo yet again we have the heroes breaking the law to find the clue needed to discover a treasure and protect it from unscrupulous twats. What makes this piss poor copy of the predecessor so annoying is that hidden in the mire are some good titbits that, if handled properly, could have made a good film.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFor example the whole "clearing the family name" thing was a good idea yet it was quickly pushed to the background so they could focus on silly car chases and an even sillier treasure hunt. Yet another example would be a rather nasty and questionable accusation about our dear old Queen Victoria. Ben finds a reference to a letter from Queen Victoria to the confederates supporting their cause and condoning slavery. These comments have no bearing on the story at all yet they are repeated twice, why? If true it'd be a great subject for a movie in itself but if not, if merely supposition, what can it do to help this film other than to put yet another question mark over British history?\r\n</p><p>\r\nEnough of the flag waving for now and let me mention briefly the acting <i>talent</i>? With a story this disjointed and absurd acting skills fall by the wayside. Cage easily fits into this kind of guilty feel good fun. Kruger is as beautiful as ever but has no purpose and Bartha chips in enough witty quips to almost justify his existence. New to the cast this time round is Harris as Mitch Wilkinson but his impressive acting CV is buried beneath a one dimensional naff villain and even stranger Helen Mirren (what was she thinking, probably "show me the money") pops up as Ben's mother, an almost unnecessary character. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDespite that torrent of negativity the movie does have some good points though I confess I am struggling to find them now. The car chase sequences are lively and the antique gadgets are quite fun. We don't really see anything new in these scenes but they do keep the energy up and the plot moving in what is a two hour plus movie. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIn anticipation of <i>"Indian Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"</i> I can see why the studios pushed this movie out now rather than later in the year. The content is thinner than a catwalk model and the story as believable as a politician's apology but the few laughs and the occasional good action scenes save this from utter disaster. Hopefully this is the end of an "adequate" franchise but I thought that about <i>"Saw 2"</i>. Watch now because this will only be more painful once Indy kicks its arse!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n	2	2011-03-26	541	2011-03-26

Hitting out at one of his teachers, Kale finds himself in front of a judge who sentences him to house arrest.  A tag is strapped on to his ankle restricting Kale from moving 100 foot from the house.\r\n</p><p>\r\nHis mother (Carrie-Ann Moss - Matrix) is distraught but determined to stop her son from becoming a computer game fanatic and general layabout slob. To make his sentence worse she blocks his iTunes and Xbox accounts in the hope it'll inspire him to do something worthwhile with his time. Fat chance.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWithout any stimulation at home, Kale only has his mobile phone and the view from his bedroom window to keep himself occupied.  His crazy friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo - Rocket Science) keeps him updated on all the happening news but Kale yearns for some real human contact.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBang on cue a beautiful girl moves in next door and he has plenty to keep his eye on!  The monotony of being trapped indoors turns Kale into a voyeur and he takes a keen interest in all his neighbourhood folk and what they get up to.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOne day, while trying to retrieve his post from the letterbox, Kale has his first encounter with pretty neighbour Ashley (Sarah Roemer - The Grudge 2).  The pair strike up a friendship and soon Kale, Ronnie and Ashley are spying on creepy neighbour Robert Turner (David Morse - 16 Blocks) whose house has been generating a wealth of female activity.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWith frequent news reports on a missing girl, Kale starts to become suspicious of Mr Turner when he spots similarities between him and the description of the girls abductor. Soon the trio are determined to find out what Mr Turner is hiding and are willing to resort to breaking into his house and stalking his movements to confirm their suspicions.\r\n</p><p>\r\nLaBeouf seems to be the hot talent to watch this year after a great performance in this year's hit <i>'Transformers'</i> and a small <i>'fourth'</i> coming Spielberg movie.  He performs well as the young delinquent in this movie who has to turn nasty to protect his family.  Great comedy support comes from Yoo who plays his mischievous friend who while Roemer puts in a convincing performance as the feisty love interest.\r\n</p><p>\r\nDon't expect Disturbia to play too many tricks on you.  The plot is pretty straightforward and the action doesn't really get going until near the end.  Nevertheless, it is an enjoyable thriller, which is bound to satisfy its teenage thriller audience.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nFans of the Hitchcock classic 'Rear Window' will find the plot familiar but sadly lacking the growing tension of that sadly forgotten thriller. Still a good movie though. \r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	484	2012-03-08
545	1	23	\N	My Blueberry Nights	<p>\r\nIt is no surprise that Chinese director Wong Kar-wai's <i>My Blueberry Nights</i> is exquisitely shot, lit and edited. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe range of misfit, emotionally-scarred characters, in what is his first full English language feature, is also business as usual for the award-winning helmer. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhat will shock fans and newcomers to his work alike is, that for all its posturing and plaintive looks, <i>My Blueberry Nights</i> is devoid of any emotional impact. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIt doesn't help that winsome songstress Norah Jones is totally wooden in the main role and is pretty much on screen for the whole film. \r\n</p><p>\r\nHer depiction of Elizabeth, who goes on a po-faced journey of self discovery across America after being dumped by her boyfriend, is totally lacking in substance. It's an uber-bland performance that echoes the maudlin, whimsical pap of one of her songs, which comprise much of My Blueberry Nights' soundtrack. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe relationship between Elizabeth and caf owner Jeremy (Jude Law - The Holiday) - which begins over a late night blueberry pie before she leaves on her journey - is unconvincing because of the weakness of Jones' performance. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIt doesn't help matters that Law just coasts on his pretty boy looks. His affectation of a particularly irritating soft northern accent also grates. It has no bearing on the plot, so why do it? You get the impression it's an attempt to disguise that there's nothing to Jeremy's boho-by-numbers character apart from smug grins, dubious hat wearing and the smoking of absurdly thin roll-ups. \r\n</p><p>\r\nRachel Weisz (Definitely, Maybe) manages a passable Tennessee accent and performance for her extended cameo as the promiscuous Sue Lynne, one of the characters that Elizabeth meets while working in a Memphis bar.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe storyline featuring Sue Lynne and her estranged, alcoholic husband Arnie (David Strathairn - Fracture), who is drinking himself to death in an effort to deal with the marital break-up and his wife's new, young lover, is the film's best section.\r\n</p><p>\r\nStrathairn's poignant and all too brief turn is easily the acting highlight of <i>My Blueberry Nights</i>. Weisz also injects Sue Lynne with enough humanity to make her more than a one dimensional man-eater. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIts next story, when Elizabeth moves to work in a Nevada casino and runs into Natalie Portman's (V for Vendetta) card shark, suffers in comparison. Portman gives a passable but familiar performance all-too similar to her role in Closer. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAlthough Wong Kar-wai is, for the most part, let down by his cast and script his trademark lush visuals mean that at least <i>My Blueberry Nights</i> is pretty to look at. \r\n</p><p>\r\nHe uses beautiful lit red interiors, striking green neon, hazy slow motion and gorgeous desert landscapes to create a sumptuous visual banquet. \r\n</p><p>\r\nBut there are some unusually sloppy stylistic choices from such a cinematic master; the self-satisfied pseudo philosophising of the voiceovers; too many shots through windows; annoyingly quirky plot contrivances and coincidences. \r\n</p><p>\r\nFor all its moments of aesthetic beauty, <i>My Blueberry Nights</i> is ultimately undone by its characters, particularly the weakness of Jones in the key role. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe lack of emotional depth and glossy style - not to mention the huge amount of scenes in bars and coffee shops - means it ends up feeling like a torturously long Nescafe or a Bacardi advert instead of the serious meditation on life and love it tries so hard to be. \r\n</p>	2	2011-03-26	545	2011-03-26
543	1	11	blah	Be Kind Rewind	<p>Jerry (Jack Black - Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story) and Mike (Mos Def - 16 Blocks) are best friends living in a New Jersey suburb. When Jerry, magnetised through his attempted sabotage mission on the local power plant, manages to accidentally erase all the tapes in the video store where Mike works, they try to remake some of the movies before Mike's boss Mr Fletcher (Danny Glover - Honey Dripper) finds out. <I>Ghostbusters</I>,<I> King Kong</I>, <I>Men in Black</I>, even <I>Driving Miss Daisy</I> get their special treatment, and the films quickly become hits in their sleepy town of Passaic.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The male leads are played by actors with reputations for playing certain types of roles and, to be honest, I had expected to watch a film with half of Tenacious D starring opposite Sergeant Murtaugh. But Danny Glover plays the part of the aged video store owner, unwilling to give up his (condemned) building or modernise into the high tech world of DVDs, with affection and great comedic timing. This film too is a step-up for Jack Black from the laugh-out-loud slapstick of his usual films to something just as funny, but clever and witty too. Mos Def handles the somewhat straight man role with a light touch and seemed to genuinely enjoy the experience. These big names on the bill are joined by Mia Farrow (The Omen) and Sigourney Weaver (The Girl in the Park), but the light touch is shared and the imaginative storyline never becomes overshadowed by the big name actors.</p>\r\n<p>The director Michel Gondry cut his directing teeth in music videos and adverts (including the now famous Levi advert 'drugstore') and the film reflects his skill of weaving together a series of entertaining vignettes with a simple storyline. It almost feels like an independent movie, that on occasion caused spontaneous applause in the cinema (the Ghostbusters costumes got such a reaction).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>On my way home from the film I stopped at Bearded Papa's cream puff shop (halfway down Oxford Street and I recommend it to all readers), and realised that this could be a great metaphor for this review. Because, what could have been a saccharine, heavy on the heart (strings) crispy crme donut of a movie was actually a clever, enjoyable, not too sweet, not too bland, better than it looked on the tin, film that left you wanting more...</p>\r\n<p>If you liked the homage to classic film making and dry humour of <I>Hot Fuzz</I>, you'll like this too... \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n	4	2011-03-26	543	2012-03-08
513	1	20	Blah	American Gangster	<p><i>American Gangster</i> has all the right ingredients to be one of the best gangster movies of all time. It is very very good, but not the stuff of legend. </p><p>\r\nBased on true events the film follows the steady rise of one of America's most powerful criminals, Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington - Deja Vu), who became the largest drug dealer in the USA during the late seventies. The movie charts Lucas' career from henchman through to kingpin and also the story of his nemesis, Detective Ritchie Roberts (Russell Crowe - 3:10 to Yuma). </p><p>\r\nAfter the demise of his boss and mentor, Lucas finds himself one of a number of hoodlums hoping to claw an empire from the remnants of the Harlem mob. Dedicated and patient Lucas strikes on a way to succeed over his peers and establish himself as the single largest source of pure cocaine. </p><p>\r\nBefore long his high quality produce at reasonable price outsells any rival and he finds himself working on a new criminal plain, higher even than the mob. Angry competitors can't even get a look in on his business and for the dedicated lawmen waging a war on drugs; they are at a loss. Lucas' quiet nature and methodical practice keep him out of sight until one evening he makes a minor mishap and catches the attention of unrelenting Detective Roberts. </p><p>\r\nRoberts is a moral cop rejected by his corrupt colleagues and assigned to a special secretive task force aimed at cracking the drug rackets. The mystery of who is 'running the show' has been gnawing at him and after Lucas' mishap, the pieces start falling into place. </p><p>\r\nDenzel Washington is undoubtedly the star of the show. His portrayal of Lucas is arguably one of his strongest performances in an already impressive portfolio. Lucas is a ruthless gangster during the day and a committed family man in the evening. Such a character needs an actor that can deliver and Washington emits great presence. Simply sitting down watching a fire burn he manages to project deep thought, fierce anger and self recrimination, all without saying a word. </p><p>\r\nTrying to balance the villain, Russell Crowe had a challenge trying to portray the hero, Detective Roberts. Somehow Crowe had to make the Roberts a viable antithesis to Lucas yet mirror his qualities. Despite first impressions I think Crowe did a good job. He plays Roberts as a patient and methodical man (like Lucas) with an unbreakable moral core (unlike Lucas). </p><p>\r\nIf the winning combination of Denzel Washington playing a bad guy and Russell Crowe playing a heroic cop wasn't enough to pique interest, having Ridley Scott (Kingdom of Heaven) as director should be enough to make any film fan curious. </p><p>\r\nThe movie is shot in true 'Scott' style with fantastic camera work and a good clean style that adds to the veracity of characters and events. The film keeps you interested throughout its two hour plus running time and balances action with engaging plot. </p><p>\r\nSadly with so much talent the expectation is so high its gonna be hard for any film to live up to perceived potential. American Gangster goes a long way to reaching cinema immortality but just doesn't quite get there. </p><p>\r\nThe closest comparator to <i>'American Gangster'</i> is probably the 1971 classic <i> 'The French Connection'</i>; A similar story of a relentless detective fighting the drug trade tearing New York apart, and in particular a mysterious master criminal pulling the strings. <i> 'French Connection'</i> is undoubtedly a five star film and even now delivers quite a punch. The problem with 'American Gangster' is that as great as it is, it's not as good as <i> 'French Connection'</i> and on reflection it lacks those few scenes here or there that could make it fantastic. </p><p>\r\nLucas' rise to omnipresent drug lord seems fairly uncontested with little or no resistance from rivals. Somehow I doubt that the true story was ever so smooth. Also once the tables turn and Lucas actually helps his nemesis, he brings down half the NYPD. This pivotal change in direction is summarized in a few scenes near the end and some information splashes before the final credits. I imagine there was enough content there to separate this film from its peers. Then again despite these quibbles I am forgetting one thing; this is a Ridley Scott film! Undoubtedly they'll be an extended cut on DVD release that'll probably blow my head off quicker than a Lucas encounter at a grocery store.</p><p>\r\nTruly great, but not as great as hoped.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	513	2012-03-08
525	1	20	Blah	Close Encounters of the Third Kind	<p><b>"Close Encounter of the First Kind - Sighting of a UFO. Close Encounter of the Second Kind - Physical Evidence. Close Encounter of the Third Kind - Contact. <i>WE ARE NOT ALONE</i>"</b>\r\n</p><p>\r\nBack in 1977 up and coming movie director Stephen Spielberg set to work on one of the most audacious and expensive science fiction movies of all time, Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Thirty years later the film is still a corner stone of modern science fiction and plays just as well now as it did on release (even if some of the effects may be a little dated).\r\n</p><p>\r\nAround the world long lost ships and planes are mysteriously reappearing in the most unexpected places but all passengers and crew remain missing. Following this creepy sequence of reappearances, and the witnesses at each scene, are a group of UN scientists who are trying to unravel these strange events.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMeanwhile in quiet middle America a humble electrician, Roy (Richard Dreyfuss - Jaws) is called out late one evening to check a remote damaged power line. Alone on the road far from anyone he has an amazing encounter with a UFO that leaves him half sunburnt, scared, and exhilarated. \r\n</p><p>\r\nHe chases the lights across the state and after narrowly missing a child in the street he pulls over to apologise to the child's mother Gillian. The mother herself is curious as to why her house looks like there has been a party going on inside it and her son, Barry, has run off through the woods. Standing there confused on the roadside Gillian and Roy then witness once again a fleet of UFO's as they race off pursued by the police.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe scientists continue to follow the clues and reports of UFO's while the everyman Roy starts to lose his mind trying to find answers in a sceptical world. His employer doesn't like his wild stories and his erratic behaviour is destroying his family.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAs these two separate stories slowly converge we, the audience, are left wondering what these events mean and contemplating whether the aliens are benign or whether they have a darker intent. This lack of 'plot on a plate' is one of the movie's strengths. It is often best to leave some things unexplained as it makes us think; also it is more frightening to suggest something than to actually reveal it.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAs an example, there is one particular scene where young Barry walks into his kitchen and disturbs some inquisitive aliens. We, the audience, do not see the aliens, we only see the mess they have made and Barry's reactions. Barry is only four so to get a convincing performance Spielberg used a few tricks* to great effect. This scene is possibly the best acting for any four-year-old and really does add an element of realism to such a fantastical story.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOverlaying the mesmerising effects and the intriguing story is one of John Williams best, if overlooked, musical scores. In one scene the distraught mother Gillian is hiding in her house with Barry while outside UFO's surround them and seem intent on taking her child. The music in this scene is scary, far scarier than Jaws, and really does make your hairs stand on end.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThis film is a five star masterpiece and a must see for any self respecting Science Fiction fan. I could write a dozen pages on why I love this film but for the sake of space I'd just say that is a close second to 'Bladerunner' for visionary science fiction. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n \r\n<br>\r\n \r\n<br>\r\n \r\n<br>\r\n \r\n<br>\r\n \r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \r\n<br>\r\n \r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* The four-year-old child actor runs to the kitchen and sees food and crockery all over the floor. He looks up and sees something strange and looks in amazement. We hear a noise and the child sees something that frightens him but then makes him smile. For the film we think the child is looking at aliens but in reality he sees a man dressed as a clown and then a man dressed as a gorilla leaps from a box (scaring the child) who then takes off his mask and makes the child smile. Simple trick, great cinema and excellent child performance!\r\n	5	2011-03-26	525	2012-03-08

423	1	15	\N	Hannibal Rising	<p>\r\nThanks to Anthony Hopkins' scene stealing performance in <i>Silence of the Lambs</i>, Hannibal Lecter has become his own worst enemy. His urbane manners combined with a tendency to unleash ferocious violence without hesitation or mercy made him a screen icon that audiences have demanded to see more of. A bizarre sequel and an unnecessary remake followed but neither managed to recreate the chilling atmosphere of Clarice Starling visiting Lecter in his Perspex prison. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe latest Lecter movie, <i>Hannibal Rising</i>, seems to have come into existence simply so author Thomas Harris could wring every last dollar out of his creation. Harris is responsible both for the film's screenplay and its accompanying novel so is uniquely to blame for the predictably disappointing results. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe plot focuses on the serial killer's early years in Europe, but why dispel the shadowy origins of such a celebrated monster as Hannibal Lecter? Fear of the unknown and the unexpected are responsible for the most lingering nightmares and yet Hannibal Rising seeks to explore the events that made him a man-eater. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe most terrifying aspect of all such creatures is their mystery. Witness how the species in Alien became less threatening with each subsequent sequel as the audience became more familiar with its appearance and habits. \r\n</p><p>\r\nUnlike the last story by Harris to feature the character, Hannibal Rising is curiously unambitious. Set at the close of the Second World War and then in the early 1950s the plot boils down to a simple revenge story. Lithuanian partisans take refuge in the Lecter cottage as the Red army advances across Eastern Europe. The men find that Hannibal and his young sister Mischa are the only surviving members of the family and as the long cold winter lingers on, one of the children begins to look more and more tasty to the hungry thugs. \r\n</p><p>\r\nTen years later and Hannibal has fled his cruel orphanage on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain to Paris where he finds refuge with his uncle's Japanese widow. In a country where war criminals are still being actively hunted down by the authorities, Hannibal decides to seek out those responsible for his sister's death and exact bloody revenge. \r\n</p><p>\r\nExplaining in great detail why Hannibal eats people was never going to produce a satisfactory answer but revealing that it's because he had a really rubbish dinner when he was eight is unforgivable. The gang of villains who are wolfed down by the nutty young doctor are led by Rhys Ifans (Notting Hill) but they don't evolve into interesting adversaries. Gong Li puts in plenty of effort but, much as in Miami Vice, she is completely miscast. With no involvement from Anthony Hopkins, young French actor Gaspard Ulliel takes up Lecter's mask but the shoes he has stepped into are far too big for him. He delivers his perfunctory dialogue in a slow clinical manner which doesn't inject the words with pant wetting menace as he intends, but instead makes Hannibal come across as someone who has been dropped on his head one too many times. \r\n</p><p>\r\nFrankly the moment our anti-hero starts to learn the way of the samurai I realised the series had become irredeemable. Hannibal Lecter should be allowed to retire gracefully before he is further diminished into just another pantomime villain.</p>	2	2011-03-26	423	2011-03-26
424	1	15	\N	Goal 2: Living the Dream	<p>Considering the previous form of sports films centred on football of the spherical variety it takes a certain amount of confidence in your story to announce a hat trick of films before the first movie even hits cinema screens. On the strength of Goal, the first outing in this proposed trilogy, it may well be worth turning up to see parts two and three.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film follows the path to glory of Santiago Munez (Kuno Becker), a poor Mexican teenager living in inner city Los Angeles. He has few prospects of escaping a life of hard grind and low wages. He spends all day cleaning rich people's gardens under the gaze of his strict father and working all night in a Chinese restaurant's kitchen. Munez, however, does have talent with a football and although he only plays with an amateur team in a dusty park he still catches the eye of ex professional Glen Foy (Stephen Dillain - King Arthur).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Munez decides to follow his dream rather than his father's advice and heads halfway round the world to try and make it as a professional in the mud and rain of Newcastle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kuno Becker only has slightly more charisma than your average footballer, but his character is interesting enough that you can't help but root for him throughout. Anna Friel (Timeline) is good as club nurse and potential love interest Roz but most impressive is Marcel Iures (Hart's War) as Newcastle United's German manager, a performance so convincing I can imagine him stalking the touch line every week during Match of the Day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film does suffer for not building towards a memorable climax. Munez has so many setbacks en route to the end, it comes as an enormous relief when he finally achieves success. Each pitfall in Munez's journey arrives and is resolved in turn before the next problem raises its head. This gives the film a slightly repetitive quality as our young hero must first deal with the mud and rain of England, then his health problems, then the dangers of celebrity. By the time a final trauma presents itself there appears to be little doubt that Munez will respond just as he did for the dozen or so earlier issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The film's real strength, however, is its sense of humour. The decision to pick Newcastle as the film's central location and United as the focus of attention means that a goldmine of Geordie humour can be exploited. Of particular amusement is the constant abuse southern mercenary Gavin Harris (Alessandro Nivola) gets from local fans for his ineffective performances on the pitch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Goal benefits from low expectations and the absolute conviction of everyone involved but it will have to come up with a few new tricks if it is to maintain audience attention for Santiago's journey all the way to Real Madrid and the World Cup beyond.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	424	2011-03-26
425	1	15	\N	The Illusionist	<p>\r\nI would love to be able to judge director Neil Burger's The Illusionist on its own merits but because of the film's subject matter and setting I simply can't help but compare it to Christopher Nolan's recent release <i>The Prestige</i>, a film which also revolved around turn of the century stage magicians. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhile The Illusionist is diverting enough entertainment, The Prestige, which appeared in cinemas late last year, has deprived it of the uniqueness the film so desperately needs to supplement its pedestrian plotting. Not only did The Prestige beat the competition to the screen, it also boasts better performances from its starry cast and most tellingly its narrative is darkly inventive. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe ending of The Illusionist can be spotted a good forty-five minutes before the credits roll. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSet in Vienna among the court of Crown Prince Leopold, heir to the throne of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, The illusionist in question is Eisenheim (Edward Norton - Red Dragon), a performer who causes a sensation among the general public with his mysterious powers. Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell - The Holiday) is so impressed with Eisenheim's conjuring he invites the magician to perform at the palace in front of much of Austria's nobility including the Countess Sophie (Jessica Biel - Stealth), a beautiful young noblewoman with whom Eisenheim just happened to be childhood friends with. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe performance turns out to be a memorable one as Eisenheim humiliates the vain and superior Prince in front of his subjects. The illusionist then further antagonises his powerful enemy by embarking on a relationship with Sophie, a woman whom Leopold had intentions of marrying. The Prince charges police inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti - Sideways) with putting an end to Eisenheim's career using whatever means are necessary. Thank God for Paul Giamatti whose dedicated police officer quickly assumes the mantle of the film's leading character from an under whelming Edward Norton. \r\n</p><p>\r\nEisenheim is portrayed as a magician of the David Blaine variety; he doesn't talk very much and every movement he takes is imbued with unnecessary significance. Enigmatic he may be, but charismatic he isn't. The police inspector, by contrast, is a decent chap who admires Eisenheim's talent but finds his career is in the hands of the villainous Leopold, and is therefore forced to do his master's bidding. Uhl must also investigate a murder to which both the Crown Prince and the illusionist are inextricably linked. \r\n</p><p>\r\nRufus Sewell gets to have some fun during the early stages of the film playing the Crown Prince as he spars with the magician and detracts from his performances. Unfortunately his arrogant character transforms into a full-blown moustache-twirling psychopath as the film progresses, which is a shame. As the love interest Jessica Biel's character doesn't need to show very much range but she does prove she can act, undoing some of the damage her involvement in Stealth must have done to her career. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWith so subdued a leading character and a plot that never really surprises, it is actually a fairly innocuous fault that is symptomatic of what is really wrong with The Illusionist. Every spirit Eisenheim conjures or illusion he creates on stage is represented in the film by an obviously computer-generated special effect. In a motion picture supposedly about magic, tellingly at no point does anything remotely magical occur.\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	425	2011-03-26

551	1	23	\N	The Cottage	<p>\r\nAfter promising so much with his first film, Paul Andrew Williams has taken a few steps back with <i>The Cottage</i>. His debut, <i>London to Brighton</i>, was a red-raw gem that seemed to herald the arrival of a new British talent in the spirit of Mike Leigh or Shane Meadows. But his follow-up lacks any of this originality, impact or creative vision. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAlthough it's an adventurous shift in tone, from the hyper-real London to Brighton to a theatrical pantomime of gore, The Cottage fails on almost every level. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAlthough billed as a 'horror comedy', it is, for the most part, unfunny and not very scary. The cast do their best with the scraps on offer. Andy Serkis and Reece Shearsmith are both excellent as two brothers who kidnap a London mob boss's daughter, played by Jennifer Ellison, and de-camp to a country cottage to wait for the money to arrive. \r\n</p><p>\r\nShearsmith's geeky, prissy Peter and Serkis' hard-man David are totally at odds from the first scene. This bitchy, love-hate relationship does provide some laughs, but it's really the only highlight of The Cottage. \r\n</p><p>\r\nJennifer Ellison's gleefully foul-mouthed performance as the nightmare-chav Tracey is briefly amusing, but her seemingly endless stream of choice four-letter combos soon grates. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhen the kidnap goes spectacularly wrong and a particularly inhospitable farmer gets involved, the splatter is taken to an absurd degree. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSome of the bloodletting has a macabre creativity to it, but it is mostly ripped from <i>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i> with a bit of <i>The Hills Have Eyes</i> thrown in. A successful horror film has to have tension and a villain that is genuinely terrifying. The blundering oaf in The Cottage is far less frightening than Jennifer Ellison's Tracey. It would also have helped if his mutated face wasn't so painfully obviously a mask. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSelf-referential horror films have had their day, it is no longer enough for a director to slavishly plunder his favourite gore-flicks for shots and scares, throw in some witty dialogue, and expect everyone to find it as fun as it must have been to make. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAlthough it is totally tongue-in-cheek, there is a mean spirit to The Cottage that makes it very hard to enjoy. London to Brighton was harsh and bleak, but it also had a convincing and touching relationship at its centre. Let's hope this is just a blip and that this talented director goes back to what he clearly does best, directing films about believable characters dealing with real issues that society would rather not confront.\r\n</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	551	2011-03-26
552	1	23	\N	Lars and the Real Girl	<p>\r\nTry and describe the plot of <i><b>Lars and the Real Girl</i></b> to anyone and the look of response is more than likely to be of bemusement. A romantic comedy about a sweet introverted loner who, in the grip of delusion, imagines a high-end sex doll is a girlfriend he has met on the internet sounds like a set-up from a Saturday Night Live comedy sketch, not a near-two hour movie.\r\n </p><p>\r\nBut Oscar-nominated scripting from Nancy Oliver, subtle direction from Craig Gillespie and the brilliance of Ryan Gosling's (Fracture) performance as Lars, make this cinematic oddity a hilarious and moving triumph. Gosling may be the latest hip young actor's name to drop, but his incredibly developed depiction of a man whose existence of voluntary loneliness reaches a critical mass, is truly extraordinary. \r\n </p><p>\r\nLars has spent his 27 years on the periphery of life in an unnamed Mid-West American town. He works in a dead-end office job where he goes out of his way to avoid human contact, and lives on his own in the converted garage of the house his brother Gus (Paul Schneider - The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford) shares with wife Karin (Emily Mortimer - Match Point). His only real interaction with the outside world is to go to church every Sunday, although his inherent decency makes him a popular member of the community. \r\n </p><p>\r\nAlthough Lars shows no obvious interest when a sleazy work colleague shows him a website that supplies sophisticated sex dolls, but before you can say anatomically correct, one has arrived and he is introducing her around town as Bianca, a half-Brazilian, half-Danish missionary confined to a wheelchair. \r\n </p><p>\r\nFollowing a hilarious dinner scene where he presents Bianca proudly at dinner to Gus and Karin, the bemused couple take Lars and his new 'girlfriend' to the local GP Dr Berman (Patricia Clarkson - No Reservations) who advises them to play along with the imagined relationship. \r\n </p><p>\r\nThis unusual set-up is actually the basis for an old fashioned love story and study of how humanity finds a way to mitigate loneliness. \r\n </p><p>\r\nBecause Lars is considered a kind and decent man, for all his social inadequacies, the other residents of the town willingly join in the subterfuge that Bianca is real. Soon everyone is united in keeping up the illusion while Dr Berman subtly treats Lars.\r\n </p><p>\r\nThrough the conversations between Lars and Dr Berman, under the pretext that they are part of treatment for Bianca, he is slowly drawn out of his shell. Although it is implied that Lars has been deeply scarred by his mother's death in childbirth with him and his father's subsequent grief, the script never over simplifies matters with easy answers. \r\n </p><p>\r\nAlso, because Gosling gives such a stunning performance, it is not necessary to signpost reasons for the way Lars is. The body language and nuances that he brings to the role, particularly in the scenes with Dr Berman, manage to convey the seething mass of emotions within Lars. His crippling shyness, social inadequacy, enormous capacity for goodness and desire for affection are all beautifully brought out. \r\n </p><p>\r\nIt isn't just the Ryan Gosling show; all of the support cast are outstanding and create an utterly believable sense of community around Lars and Bianca. Kelli Garner's (Dreamland) performance as the gawky but pretty Margo, Lars' non-plastic love interest, is particularly strong, as is Patricia Clarkson's depiction of the icy but compassionate Dr Berman. \r\n </p><p>\r\nAlthough the cast and script of Lars and the Real Girl were criminally overlooked at this year's Oscars, this is one of the most intelligent and affecting dramas of recent times. Far more than a gimmicky set-up, this rounded masterpiece is must-see, stunningly executed, cinema.\r\n</p>	4	2011-03-26	552	2011-03-26
563	1	20	\N	Fools Gold	<p><b>Fools Gold</b> is an adequate romantic comedy adventure that will ultimately make good Saturday afternoon entertainment. Sadly in a recent spate of 'treasure hunt' themed movies it doesn't really connect.</p><p>\r\nThe story, thin as it is, follows an impulsive reckless treasure hunter Benjamin (Matthew McConaughey - Sahara) who has finally found the clue he needs to locate a long lost sunken treasure ship. To fund his previous exploits he spent all of his money and that of his darling wife Tess (Kate Hudson - The Skeleton Key), who has finally divorced the daydreamer so she can get her life back on track. </p><p>\r\nNow with his new clue, and a lot of angry debtors on his trail, Ben has one chance to get some funding. A millionaire, Nigel (Donald Sutherland - Pride & Prejudice) is enjoying a cruise in the local area and Ben hopes to talk the guy into funding his latest quest. Little does Ben know but his darling wife Tess works onboard Nigel's ship and fate has set them back on collision course. </p><p>\r\nWith everything going so swimmingly well all we need to do is chuck in a handful of one dimensional villains and a dozen or so action scenes and you have the ingredients for a so-so comedy.\r\n</p><p>This film suffers for its lack of originality. The characters are all very reminiscent as is the setting. McConaughey is just repeating his character from the equally so-so Sahara while Kate Hudson plays the usual control freak career woman, and Donald Sutherland plays the clich wealthy wise old man who ultimately will save our heroes without upstaging them. All these well known players are then dumped into the ever beautiful Caribbean setting and a story similar to the recent (so-so) 'Into The Blue', itself a rip off of the unaccredited 'The Deep'.\r\n</p><p>After the unexpected success of 'How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days' I think my expectations for this reteam of McConaughey and Hudson were too high. Both gave it a go but they had little material to work with, literally in some semi-clad scenes.\r\n</p><p>Despite my grumbling this movie is very pretty and is good fun. It is like a strange cross breed between <i> 'Romancing the Stone'</i> and <i> 'Into the Blue'</i>, it's an airhead adventure packed with pretty people and pretty locations. \r\n</p><p>Recommended for fans of <i>'Sahara'<i>, </i> 'Into the Blue'</i> and <i> 'National Treasure'</i>.\r\n	2	2011-03-26	563	2011-03-26
567	1	23	\N	Charlie Bartlett	<p>\r\nAs confused and mixed-up as its American high school characters, Charlie Bartlett is an occasionally hilarious mess. Inexperienced director Jon Poll aims for a Wes Anderson-style take on the lives of jaded, but implausibly witty, teenagers who inhabit a heavily-stylised version of reality. A modern innovator like Anderson can pull this off, while also making salient points about the human condition. Charlie Bartlett feels like the work of a director uneasy with his own film's tonal shifts, leaving the film feeling ostentatious and unfulfilling. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe eponymous hero, played by Anton Yelchin (Alpha Dog), is a super intelligent misfit who is expelled from his exclusive private school for forging huge quantities of fake IDs. He returns home to live in the Bartlett mansion with his unhinged mother and starts at the local public school. Although he is initially rejected, his access to the family's private psychiatrist - and by extension lots of prescription pharmaceutical treats - leads to popularity and college celebrity status. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThe enterprising chap is soon using the school's toilets to dispense dime-store psychology and drugs falsely acquired on prescription. Life is complicated yet further, when Charlie starts a relationship with Susan (Kat Dennings - Big Momma's House 2), the daughter of the alcoholic school Principal, played by Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man) in a part he could do in his sleep. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThe hotly tipped Yelchin does provide some amusing moments in the title role. His wonderfully expressive Ritalin freak-out and an unhinged high school theatre audition are particular highlights. But you don't find yourself rooting for him in the same way you did for Ellen Page as Juno, a film that Charlie Bartlett will undoubtedly be compared to. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThis lack of identification with the key character isn't helped by sloppy back-story inconsistencies undermining key moments. In a supposedly revelatory and moving scene with Susan, Charlie says he has had to care for his mother through mental illness. Hasn't he been at various boarding schools for most of his life? Also, the moments with his mother show him at his worst; as a spoilt, inconsiderate, brat. Charlie is by no means the caring adult before his time as the script would have us believe. This dubious side to his character is shown most clearly in a very badly handled section, when one of his customers tries to commit suicide. Although his reaction is supposed to be compassionate, the way it is written and acted just doesn't get this across. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThe tense relationship between Kat Dennings' Susan and Downey Jr.'s Principal Gardner suffer from similar flaws. This is more down to the familiarity of seeing Downey Jr. portray yet another self-destructive boozer, than any fault of the young actress. Her Susan is smart and sexy, without ever suffering from the irritating, over-the-top quirkiness of most of the film's other characters. For all Anton Yelchin's screen time and intermittently amusing theatrics; it is Dennings that comes out of Charlie Bartlett as the true star.\r\n</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	567	2011-03-26
569	1	23	\N	Three and Out	<p>\r\nMoments of comic brilliance and a gleefully barbed, foul-mouthed, performance from Colm Meaney (Layer Cake) can't save 'Three and Out' from mediocrity. It feels rushed and clumsy, as if someone came up with some great set-pieces and then didn't bother to connect them properly into a cohesive and satisfying plot.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAll of Three and Out's best moments involve Meaney, who combines sarcastic one-liners with genuine charm as Tommy, the down-and-out whose inability to go through with suicide puts him on the receiving end of a bizarre offer from Mackenzie Crook's (Pirates of the Caribbean - At World's End)Paul.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe proposition relates to the film's title; tube driver and wannabe writer Paul has two people fall under his train in a week. He's told by another driver about a little-known rule; if someone else goes under his train that month he'll be laid off with ten year's pay. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDesperate to escape the rat race and de-camp to a remote Scottish island to write a novel, he starts looking for a volunteer. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThat's where Tommy comes in. Paul stops the Irishman throwing himself off a London bridge to make him a proposition, 1500 for one last weekend, after which he has to go under Paul's train. \r\n</p><p>\r\nCrook plays the miserable straight man competently, but he's better used in less winy roles where his hang-dog features can act as a counterpoint. Paul's just a little too po-faced to be likeable. It's also hard to sympathise with a man who is prepared to even entertain killing someone in this manner. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThis uncertain tone is Three and Out's main problem, it wants to be glib and irreverent about taboo issues like suicide and euthanasia, while also trying to make the audience identify and sympathise with its characters. Three and Out is experienced music video and ad director Jonathan Girschfield's first film and it shows in this lack of conviction. He also overtly reveals his origins in the all-too regular and obtrusive use of music, particularly in the cringe-worthy final scenes.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe manner in which Three and Out is rounded off is unbelievable and totally predictable. Skipping jauntily over some gaping holes in logic, it leaves the viewer lamenting the fact that, although the UK has produced world class sitcoms, our recent forays into cinematic comedy have left a lot to be desired.\r\n</p>	2	2011-03-26	569	2011-03-26
571	1	8	\N	Iron Man	<p>\r\nAnother summer. Another action movie. Another comic book adaptation. The stars of Marvel comics have become a staple of the box office over the past few years, with smashes that include the Spider-Man, X-Men and Blade trilogies, as well as the two Fantastic Four offerings. Even the so-called 'disappointing' offerings haven't provided serious setbacks for the corporation. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nAnd with the release of Iron Man, Marvel Studios' first entirely self-financed film, the juggernaut looks set to keep on rolling. Crowd-pleasing, although hardly original, Iron Man makes for surprisingly entertaining viewing. With the right balance of humour, action and story it is a gripping movie, although perhaps a little stretched at times. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nTony Stark, the drink-swilling, high-rolling, fun-loving, womanising CEO of Stark Industries, is captured by terrorists while demonstrating the latest high-tech weapon of mass destruction. Using his vast intelligence and ingenuity (did we mention he is also a genius inventor) he escapes after building an impressive suit of armour, laden with various gadgets enabling his escape. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nIt is an impressive first quarter, if slightly reminiscent of the A-Team's ability to build tanks from cars with a bit of sticky-back plastic! His time in captivity has been a life-altering experience for the billionaire, who renounces his company's weapon-producing in favour of finding ways to protect humanity. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nIt could so easily have gone wrong at this point, but with acclaimed director Jon Favreau (Swingers) at the helm it remains on course. A surprise choice at first, it's hard to imagine anyone who is better suited to the role of Stark than Robert Downey Jr (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang). His portrayal of the arrogant, and occasionally vulnerable, hero is absolutely riveting. Quick-witted, perfectly dry and world weary Downey plays the role to perfection. He is matched by the virtually unrecognisable Jeff Bridges (Surfs Up), who suits up as brilliantly villainous Obadiah Stane, Tony's right-hand man at Stark Industries. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nWhile Gwyneth Paltrow (Infamous) and Terrance Howard (Awake) both thrive in their perhaps slightly under-developed supporting roles, with Paltrow delivering a forties-esque performance as Stark's girl Friday. The chemistry between Paltrow and Downey is palpable. They positively sparkle, bringing sincerity, honesty and old-fashioned comedy to their relationship. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nAt times the story feels a little drawn out (the building montages spring to mind), and yet it also feels a little underdeveloped at other points. And yes, it isn't the most original film around. It's predictable. The twists are easy to work out. But all in all, Iron Man is a visually-stunning, highly amusing and extremely satisfying romp, with a hero who is rooted in the 'real' world. He is flawed, he has lived (boy, has he lived!) and he has made mistakes. He's not a mutant, he hasn't received super-powers as a result of a science experiment gone wrong or been the victim of a radioactive spider bite! For all his wealth and arrogance, he's just a man who has a way with technology and an exceptionally inventive mind. It is this that makes it all the more enjoyable.\r\n</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	571	2011-03-26
572	1	16	\N	What Happens in Vegas	<p>\r\nHailing from the same city but from vastly different backgrounds, two strangers from New York City end up randomly meeting in Las Vegas.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nJoy (Cameron Diaz - The Holiday), a beautiful and hard working woman, has just been dumped by her high flying fianc for being too organised and not letting her hair down once in a while.  Meanwhile, Jack (Ashton Kutcher - Just Married) has stepped across the line far too many times at work and his boss (his own father) is fed up with him and sacks him on the spot.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThe pair turn to their friends for support and the foursome happen to decide on the exact same location in which to drown their sorrows, no other than Vegas!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nTheir paths cross when there is a mix up at the hotel and the four strangers are thrust together and forced to socialise for the better good.  Joy and her girl friend are desperate to lose the geeks and find their own fun while Jack is keen on convincing Joy to go for just one drink with him.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nA few shots later, Joy has let loose and Jack admires her even more.  She is a wild child at heart like him and the two seem like a match made in heaven.  After more and more alcohol has been consumed, the night becomes blurry and everyone crashes for the night.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nJoy wakes up the next morning in an unfamiliar bed with a throbbing head and a mysterious ring on her finger.  Unsure of the antics from the previous night, she goes down to breakfast to confront Jack and to find out the truth.  As much as the truth hurts, the pair did get married but in the cold sober light of day both Joy and Jack are starting to regret their hasty actions.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nAfter a major bust up and a vow to return home and demand an annulment, Jack takes Joy's coin and goes for a last bet on the fruit machine.  To his surprise, he wins and starts embracing his new found fortune.  But brand new wifey is not far behind and is determined to use her latest nuptials to bleed him dry and win her share of the fortune.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nHow will the money grabbing pair stay sane to make sure they win the money but avoid killing each other in the process?\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nKutcher and Diaz put in a great performance as the unlikely couple whose drunken antics lead to far more than they ever bargained for.  Watch out for dirty tricks and underhand plots!  The movie is full of some great one-liners and comedy scenes with great support from Lake Bell (Over Her Dead Body) and Rob Corddry (Semi-Pro) as the best friends who absolutely detest each other.  Even Queen Latifah (Hairspray) makes an appearance as the marriage counsellor.  \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nIf you imagine a cross breed of 'How to lose a guy in 10 days' and 'Just Married' you'll have a good idea of what this film is like. Fans of 'Just Married', 'The Wedding Date', 'How to lose a guy in 10 days', and '27 Dresses' will enjoy this movie.  \r\n</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	572	2011-03-26
575	1	20	\N	Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull	<p>\r\nWhen I first heard they were going to make a fourth Indiana Jones movie I developed a temporary split personality. One half of me yelled 'oh woe; why do they feel the need to destroy my childhood memories', and after the turd that was Star Wars Episode Three I think that voice was quite justified. Then the second voice piped up saying, 'Well what if it is good? It could be really good, after all it can't be as bad as National Treasure 2'. My apprehensions would win over my optimism and then my excitement would be body slammed by cynicism. Now at last it is here and my sanity hangs in the balance.</p><p>\r\nWhen we last saw Indy he was racing the Nazis to find the Holy Grail in the nineteen thirties. Set twenty years later we now find a tired Indy being dragged from his cosy classroom for another adventure.  This time it is the Russians who add danger to the mix and a mysterious lost civilisation in South America that holds the key to global supremacy for good or evil. </p><p>\r\nIndy (Harrison Ford - Firewall) has been kidnapped by a group of tough commies and taken to a secret US storage facility. There he is forced to aid the Russians locate a box containing a mysterious object. After a fun and fantastic action sequence the Russians escape and a very lucky to be alive Indy is picked up by the authorities. </p><p>\r\nSuspected of being a communist in fifties America, not a happy prospect, Indy quickly loses his job and his direction in life. Just then a young hoodlum (Shia LeBeouf - Transformers) on a motorbike arrives and gives Indy a cryptic message from an old collage buddy.  Before Indy can finish reading the note he is interrupted by two thickset out of place Russians and we have another action sequence. </p><p>\r\nA pattern is forming; bit of story followed by a dollop of action. Finally Indy gets a quiet cup of tea and after reading the strange cryptic note he and his new friend, the hoodlum named Mutt, head to South America where they quickly find themselves in a creepy tomb beset by blowpipe wielding gymnasts. </p><p>\r\nWhat follows is a rather fun action adventure that gives small nods to the preceding Indy movies and some great action sequences. The Indy trademark scenes all make an appearance including the bugs and the story moves toward a love it or hate it final act. The ingredients are there and at moments it looks like the magic is back but after watching the whole film it feels like it is lacking something. </p><p>\r\nThe problem I find reviewing this, as a massive Indiana Jones fan, is that my memories and love of the preceding movies are woven into the fabric of my childhood. The movie has some issues, not only the increased use of computer generated effects but the storyline strays from intriguing to bizarre to silly. I won't be ruining anything to let slip that there is an extra-terrestrial involvement in the story. A brave and curious choice of storyline considering the myriad ideas posted online by wannabe directors. This story has potential but never pans out, it just fizzles weakly. </p><p>\r\nThen there is the acting, strangely the weakness in this department isn't the often irritating Shia LeBeouf or the aged Harrison Ford but the multiple Oscar nominated Cate Blanchett (Elizabeth the Golden Age) who managed to camp up her role more than a carnival of drag queens high on acid. Maybe it was a lack of character development, her skinny villainess Sparko, sorry I meant Spalko, has little back story, or maybe it was the thin script, but she never really scared anyone and there was little doubt who'd win through in the end. I do love Blanchett but this was one of her hammiest performances. </p><p>\r\nBUT WHO CARES? IT'S INDIANA JONES AND HE'S BACK! Despite the nerds whinging and that controversial ending this movie is still fun and worth the price of admission. To defend that statement I'll finish with my excuse for why the ending isn't crap. The extra-terrestrial tint actually is a nice subtle nod to all those classic fifties adventure B-Movies that helped inspire the original Indiana Jones movies. Also those fifties B-Movies about aliens were a thinly veiled comment on the then communist threat; this new movie ironically has the communists as the villains and the aliens hiding for a majority of the movie.  </p><p>\r\n<b>Watch it, you know you want to.</b> </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n	3	2011-03-26	575	2011-03-26
576	1	20	\N	Awake	<p>Clay Beresford (Hayden Christensen - Jumper) appears to have it all. He is young, good looking, is engaged to a beautiful girl called Sam (Jessica Alba - Good Luck Chuck) and is fantastically rich. Sadly he also has a megalomaniac dominant mother, Lilith (Lena Olin - Hollywood Homicide) and a very serious heart condition.</p> \r\n<p>With pressure from Sam to tell his possessive mother that they are engaged and an imminent heart transplant operation poor Clay is a bit under the cosh but he has a friend, doctor Jack Harper (Terrence Howard - The Brave One) to keep a watchful eye over him. Jack saved Clay's life after a massive heart attack and since then they have grown to be good friends. Clay wants Jack to perform the transplant against the advice of Lilith.</p> \r\n<p>After a pressured day Clay and Sam finally tell Lilith they are engaged and then rush off to the church before she has a chance to voice her disapproval. No sooner are they wed and they are on the bed tearing their clothes off when they get a call from the hospital, the heart has arrived. Woohoo, let's have our honeymoon in intensive care!</p> \r\n<p>Arriving at the hospital for the operation Lilith pleads with Clay to use her preferred surgeon but Clay is defiant. Within minutes Clay is stripped, robed and on the slab with an alcoholic anaesthetist about to make life really uncomfortable.</p> \r\n<p>As Clay slips towards unconsciousness before the operation something goes wrong. He is paralysed but still awake. He can hear the banter of the surgeons and can feel the scalpel as it plunges into his chest. If the waking hell of a transplant operation isn't scary enough Clay soon learns something far more worrying. Jack, his friendly surgeon, and his team of assistants have no intention of letting Clay survive, they are trying to kill him and make it look like a consequence of the operation. Why do they want him dead and how do they plan to get away with it?</p> \r\n<p>The film progresses into a two thread thriller with Clay listening to the conspirators and trying to unravel their motives while his family start to suspect something is wrong and begin to act on their concerns.</p> \r\n<p>Hayden Christensen is a plank, no offence, so this role of lying very still suits his particular style of acting. Luckily the supporting cast is far more impressive, Jessica Alba is always fantastic and she works hard here to shatter her stereotype. However the best performance comes from Lena Olin as the over protective mother who manages to keep us guessing until the final scenes about what her motivation really is.</p> \r\n<p>Overall this is a nice little thriller for the wider audience. Some of the twists were a bit predictable but it was a fun edgy medical thriller with elements of 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' and 'The English Patient' less their greatness.</p> \r\n<p>Recommended for fans of humdrum thrillers such as Pathology or the television show ER.   </p> \r\n	3	2011-03-26	576	2011-03-26

My apprehensions <p>\r\nThe glamorous four ladies from Sex and the City (SATC) hit the big screen for the first time.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nSATC has saturated our TV screens of late due to the overwhelming publicity following the controversial decision to host the worldwide premiere of the movie in London rather than its native New York.  \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThe movie starts by introducing the four fashion icons with a brief insight into their past for non-fans of the TV show.  \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nCarrie (Sarah Jessica Parker - Smart People) and Mr Big are discussing their future together and taking their relationship to the next level.

579	1	20	\N	The Incredible Hulk	<p>\r\nMarvel's largest comic hero, The Hulk, returns for another go at smashing the box office. For those who have never heard of the Incredible Hulk, the rare few, the basic story tells of a brilliant mild mannered scientist who accidentally receives a large dose of radiation. The scientist looks normal enough but when he gets angry or excited he transforms into a huge powerful green monster, The Incredible Hulk, who has a primal personality. Wanted by the military who view the hulk as a breakthrough super soldier technology, and desperate to find a cure, Dr Banner is on the run. This is broadly where the new movie picks things up.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMany will remember the 2002 movie <i>'The Hulk'</i> directed by Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain), and starring Eric Bana (Munich). That movie wasn't the huge success that the studios were hoping for, probably because it focused more on character than the all important action. When Eric Bana finally did turn green the movie did pick up but by then many had tuned out.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThis time round the Hulk has obviously had a relaxing cup of tea and thought of a better way to win popularity. I can almost imagine the muscle-bound monster sitting on a sofa with Trinny and Susannah crying into a tissue as he confesses his insecurities and they pat his expansive thigh reassuringly. How to revive the Hulk's public image?  Not too difficult when the target audience is young teenage Americans, they have seriously ramped up the action quota and we even see hints of carnage in the opening credits. Chuck in a few sexual innuendos and a massive showdown and you're there.\r\n</p><p>\r\nReplacing Eric Bana, we now have Edward Norton (Love in the Time of Cholera) who adds a little more American gravitas to the performance. Similarly Liv Tyler (Reign Over Me) replaces Jennifer Connolly as love interest Betty Ross and William Hurt (Vantage Point) replaces Sam Elliot as relentless General Thunderbolt Ross. Some of these changes work (Norton is on usual top form) some of them don't (Liv is good but me like Jennifer Connolly). Ultimately this film is a good fun and will surely secure a sequel.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAdded to the core trio of characters they also introduce a new nemesis and of course he is British. Tim Roth (Sea Wolf [TV]) plays Emil Blonsky, an experienced soldier intent on defeating the Hulk even at the expense of his own humanity. Brave at first poor Emil becomes corrupted by the challenge and is doomed to become the 'Abomination', another huge mutant mess for the final climatic showdown.\r\n</p><p>\r\nComparing this new movie with the earlier <i>'The Hulk'</i>, is difficult as each movie's strengths mirror a weakness in the other. The acting in this latest adventure, as good as it is, doesn't quite reach the standards of the earlier movie probably due to the final edit. Meanwhile the lack of sustained action in the first movie is compensated for by oodles of greenery in this new mutant movie. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIn the end people go to see the Hulk smash sh*t up and he definitely does that. The thin story leading the plot forward is good enough for purpose and can certainly improve. Also it has been hinted that there is a great deal of material on the cutting room floor so maybe we'll see an extended cut on DVD. \r\n</p><p>\r\nBoth films are great but this one has the edge on the all important action. Recommended for fans of superhero movies like <i>'Iron Man'</i>, <i>'Fantastic Four - Rise of the Silver Surfer'</i> and of course, Ang Lee's <i>'The Hulk'</i>.\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	579	2011-03-26
581	1	20	\N	Kung Fu Panda	<p>\r\nIn the mystical east lies the valley of peace where the people live in harmony knowing that the furious five (a group of kung fu masters) will protect them and that the great enemy, Tai Lung, is safely in prison.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn a small noodle shop, an unlikely hero dreams of great adventures, but he isn't a fearsome kung fu tiger, or monkey, or even mantis, he is a fat lazy daydreaming panda called Po. All his life Po has fantasised of becoming a kung fu hero but his weight and his job in the family noodle shop leave little hope, but finally destiny plays a hand.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOn a high peak overlooking the valley Master Oogway, a tortoise of great wisdom, has foreseen the escape of Tai Lung and decides finally to appoint the supreme dragon warrior and in an accident Po is appointed hero. While the kung fu master, Shifu, tries to rid the heroes of the fat panda, the evil Tai Lung escapes prison as Oogway predicted and heads toward the valley looking for vengeance.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe furious five race to meet the enemy while Shifu labours in vain to turn Po into a fighter. Can Po find the inner strength that he needs to become a hero and, even if he can, will he be able to defeat the all powerful Tai Lung?\r\n</p><p>\r\nKung Fu Panda has been in development for what feels like years. A very early sneak peek got excitement buzzing and the great vocal cast fuelled the fire. Now after the slow development the film arrives, does it live up to its hype? \r\n</p><p>\r\nKung Fu Panda is really good fun and has some great action sequences and likeable characters that set it above some of the tired relations. Master Oogway is a particular highlight and if sequels are made this character must make a mystical return. The story isn't the most original but it does have a lot of heart and the good vocal cast helps add to the subtle winning formula.\r\n</p><p>\r\nJack Black (Be Kind Rewind) adds his lazy rock dude persona to Po and clashes nicely with the stern but smooth voice of Dustin Hoffman (Stranger Than Fiction) as Shifu, and the meditative tones of Randall Duk Kim (Memoirs of a Geisha) as Oogway. In support, offering in some instances only a few words, are great stars such as Angelina Jolie (Beowulf), Seth Rogan (Superbad), Jackie Chan (Rush Hour 3), James Hong (Balls of Fury), Michael Clark Duncan (Sin City) and Ian "must have Englishman voicing villain" McShane (The Golden Compass). \r\n</p><p>\r\nThese great voices and a jolly script add together well to compliment the excellent animation. The animation style is reminiscent of <i>Madagascar</i> but more evolved, or <i>The Incredibles</i> but more animal-orientated. The fighting animals of this movie are mostly furry, and fur must be a pain to animate. Also there is a great deal of action, dramatic landscapes, and highly detailed sets to keep the animators locked away for years. The efforts of those tireless artists has been rewarded, the effect is cool kung fu.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOver the last few years there have been a growing number of animated movies and the concept has started to wear a little thin. Great characters such as Shrek have been milked dry and now we need something new. While Pixar's <i>"Wall-e"</i> promises heartfelt emotion from a cute robot, Kung Fu Panda's less subtle action comedy is no worse off for being a simple pleasure.\r\n</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	581	2011-03-26
583	1	16	\N	Wall E	<p>\r\nWall-E is a simple and grubby robot who spends his days at the garbage site digesting rubbish and transforming them into perfect squares of waste.  His only companion is his trusty cockroach! The problem is the garbage site he lives in is quite large, it's called the Earth, and he has been cleaning it for 900 years!\r\n</p><p>\r\nHe lives an uncomplicated life in his own haven with a wealth of gadgets and gizmos that he has recovered from his surroundings.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nOne day Wall-E's peaceful existence is disturbed by the sudden landing of a futuristic spaceship.  The ship leaves behind one of its robots, Eve, who has been sent to Earth on a specific mission.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nAt first Wall-E is very sceptical about the new visitor and she is of him so he spends most of his time being chased and shot at by Eve!  Eventually the two become friends and Wall-E opens his home and treasures to his new found friend.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nBut friendship never runs smoothly and just as the robots are starting to warm to one another, Eve makes a discovery, the very thing she has been looking for. She shuts down and is quickly retrieved by her spaceship.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nWall-E is reluctant to let his only friend disappear and follows Eve to a whole new world in the sky where couch potatoes laze about all day in a futuristic space cruiseship city.  \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nWall-E is the latest movie from Pixar, home to <i>The Incredibles</i>, <i>Nemo</i>, <i>Cars</i> and <i>Ratatouille</i>. The animation here once again goes a step further and the absence of any real dialogue means that the mannerisms and characteristics of the robots must carry the film. Fortunately Wall-E is a fantastic creation, part ET, part Johnny Number 5, the animators have crammed this grubby little robot with charm, wit and emotional presence. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nAs an adult I was gripped and enjoyed the moral message and the innocent romance. However while the movie offers excellent animation and a sweet and touching story, I don't feel it has enough action or fun to keep the younger viewers amused.\r\n</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	583	2011-03-26
584	1	8	\N	The Dark Knight	<p>\r\nEasily the most eagerly anticipated film of 2008, the wait for the newest Batman release is finally over. Following on from the fantastic <i>Batman Begins</i>, fans have been clamouring for the arrival of <b>The Dark Knight</b> since the masterful marketing campaign began last year. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nBut few could have predicted the frenzy that followed the untimely and tragic passing of Heath Ledger (I'm Not There) in January. But can it measure up to all the hype? Honestly? It goes beyond. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nChristopher Nolan has produced an amazing piece of cinematography and it is quite possibly one of the best films I've seen in a long time. Visually, The Dark Knight is stunning. Cinematographer Wally Pfister once again links up with Nolan to bring Gotham City out of the shadows. No longer is this crime-riddled, corrupt conurbation the gloomy, gothic creation of the past. Instead a lighter, Chicago-inspired modern metropolis takes its place. It is a much more effective backdrop for a rampaging psychopath to rain terror on. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThe casting of the main players is another masterstroke. The main focus will of course be on Ledger, in his last completed role before his death. He positively shines as the Clown Prince of Crime, delivering a truly disturbing portrayal of the Joker. His character is a million miles away from Jack Nicholson's entertaining, if slightly hammy, Joker. He is a twisted and unpredictable villain, with a masochistic bent for chaos. And Ledger thrills with an electrifying performance. But with all eyes on Ledger, there is the fear that the remainder of the equally impressive cast may be overlooked. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nOnce again, Christian Bale (3:10 To Yuma) is impressive as both Batman and Bruce Wayne. Arguably the best of those who have donned the cowl, he plays the troubled vigilante with depth and compassion. He also effortlessly portrays the different facets of a complex character - from the seemingly superficial playboy billionaire, the confident and fearless crusader, to the conflicted man beneath both masks. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nAaron Eckhart (No Reservations) convinces as Harvey Dent, the District Attorney on a mission to clean up Gotham's streets and bring down organised crime, but it is in his descent into the darkness where he really comes alive. It is both a chilling and heartbreaking transformation which sees Gotham's 'white knight' becoming the very thing that he has fought against for so long. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nMichael Caine (Sleuth), Gary Oldman (Dead Fish) and Morgan Freeman (The Bucket List) are as dependable as ever in their supporting roles, with Oldman in particularly good form as Lt James Gordon. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nIf there were one weak link, it would be the usually fantastic Maggie Gyllenhaal (Sherrybaby). This is not a criticism of the actress herself, but you can't help but feel she is under-used as the feisty damsel-in-distress. A minor criticism of an epic movie.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nIt is a thought-provoking outing for Batman, which walks a finely balanced line between action and philosophising. In less capable hands, it may have failed miserably, but Nolan captures it all with style and grace. This is a spectacular blockbuster which delivers more than you could ever hope for.\r\n</p>\r\n	5	2011-03-26	584	2011-03-26
585	1	16	\N	Get Smart	<p>\r\nMax Smart (Steve Carrell) is super at his job.  He is an analyst for the secret US spy agency known as 'Control' and has excellent skills at deciphering "chatter" between criminal minds and pinpointing their location within minutes.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nBut Max has his heart set on bigger and better things.  He yearns to be out in the field, fighting crime head on. He can only admire the successful agents like Agent 23 (Dwayne Johnson - The Game Plan) from afar who can crush bad guys with his bare hands!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nOne day the Control headquarters is attacked and the identities of their agents are compromised.  The chief (Alan Arkin - Little Miss Sunshine) is forced to send in rookie Smart, partnered with the only agent whose identity has not been revealed, Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway - The Devil Wears Prada).\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThe unlikely duo are assigned to pursue the crime syndicate KAOS who are behind a series of national security threats.  While Smart is still finding his feet, Agent 99 is already a trained assassin with no patience for her new rookie partner and his weak skills. That all changes after a hilarious dance off (I won't explain)!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nSoon the two learn to work together and become quite the mean fighting machine.  But will they be able to keep work and pleasure separate while fighting the bad guys?\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nCarrell is perfect as the haphazard if super intelligent new agent and his relationship with feisty and headstrong Hathaway's character is a joy to watch. Carrell delivers some perfect one-liners mixed with madcap physical comedy. Meanwhile Hathaway oozes sex appeal and intelligence with her own fair share of acrobatics. With all this going on Johnson has little to do but provide some good moments of violent hilarity as the brawn.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nGet Smart, based on the classic Mel Brooks TV show, superseded my expectations.  It was full of comical moments, great acting, good stunts and an engaging storyline.  I would recommend this for fans of Johnny English and Austin Powers but it's much much better.  \r\n</p><p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	585	2011-03-26
588	1	15	\N	Hancock	<p>\r\nHancock begins as a refreshingly skewed take on the superhero genre. What would life be like in a city where the man gifted with the superpowers to protect it was a complete and utter arsehole? \r\n</p><p>\r\nNo waving to the cameras like Spider-man here because 'heroic' John Hancock (Will Smith - I Am Legend) is an abusive drunk and Los Angeles wants rid of him after his latest clumsy crime fighting exploits result in millions of dollars of damages. \r\n</p><p>\r\nOnly one man seems grateful for Hancock's misunderstood efforts; public relations man Ray (Jason Bateman - Juno) who takes it upon himself to rehabilitate Hancock back into the community by smoothing away some of his rougher edges. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAt this point in his career it seems unnecessary to say that Will Smith has the charisma to make his hobo hero likeable even when swearing at irate members of the public. As usual Smith is the main draw for audiences but backing him up is a concept that is both funny and original which makes it such a shame that the plot chooses to flush it down the toilet at barely mid way through the film. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe term 'jumping the shark' was coined to describe the point at which a television show lost believability and veered into the bizarre or absurd. The correct cinematic version has recently become known as 'nuking the fridge' thanks to this summer's work by Steven Spielberg and serial childhood memory abuser George Lucas. \r\n</p><p>\r\nHancock's first half laughs may be mostly featured in the widely exposed movie trailer but Bateman makes for a good straight-man in what seems to be the early stages of a decent buddy comedy. Then the big twist comes along which switches the focus onto Hancock's origins rather than his current and future role as a hero, dispensing with much of the comedy at the same time. \r\n</p><p>\r\nJason Bateman is reduced to standing around dumbfounded at the turn proceedings have taken and Charlize Theron (Aeon Flux) steps in to propel a poorly thought out narrative towards an unexciting action climax where jeopardy is introduced for the previously impervious Hancock without satisfactorily explaining why.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn the light of a summer which has consistently met, and even on occasion exceeded, audience and critic's expectations<I> Hancock</I> proves itself to be a blockbuster disappointment. I suspect the script could have benefited from another rewrite to deal with its uneven storytelling but instead a politically incorrect superhero franchise has perhaps crashed before it even got the chance to take off.\r\n</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	588	2011-03-26
589	1	8	\N	Prince Caspian	<p>\r\nEver since reading about a magical world filled with kings and queens, magic, mythical creatures and epic battles between good and evil, I have been entranced. It was in a dog-eared book on my elder sister's shelves that I first discovered CS Lewis' tales and I was instantly besotted  climbing into wardrobes around my house in a childish attempt to find my own way to Narnia. So you can imagine my delight at the news that the series was finally going to be hitting the big screen. It soon turned to disappointment at the first outing, The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe (2005). \r\n</p><p>\r\nSo it was with a mixture of excitement and trepidation that I filed into my local cinema for the screening of Prince Caspian. I needn't have worried. The pace is set from the start, with the film opening with a frenetic horse chase as Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes - Stardust) flees his castle and his murderous uncle Lord (and self-styled King) Miraz (Sergio Castellitto). </p><p>\r\n\r\n Escaping into the Narnian woods, he discovers the myths and legends his old professor taught him are true when he stumbles across dwarfs and talking beasts summoning the kings and queens of old along the way. And so the Pevensies return to more savage Narnia, some 1300 years after they left (although only twelve months have passed for the four siblings). \r\n</p><p>\r\nCaspian has to find the strength to become King and must accept help in the unexpected form of four children. Rivalries emerge, faith is lost and found and the old magic is awoken as battle commences. And I for one was glued to every moment of the unfolding drama. \r\n</p><p>\r\nOnce again the visual effects are stunning, with seamless interactions between live action and CGI. Reepicheep is a triumph, stealing virtually every scene and that is as much a testament to the computer animation wizards as it is to the script and to Eddie Izzard's (Ocean's Thirteen) perfect vocalisation. Prince Caspian exceeded all of my expectations. As one of my least favourite of the seven instalments, I had always struggled with aspects of the tale but Andrew Adamson's adaptation came much closer to the story I had always wanted the book to tell. \r\n</p><p>\r\nBook purists may baulk at some of the changes, but many of them enhance the story,  especially the addition of a much stronger Susan (Anna Popplewell - The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe), as she takes her place in battle alongside her brothers. She was by far the most woefully under-developed character in Lewis' series and Adamson goes someway to correcting this. While Susan flourishes, Edmund (Skandar Keynes - The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe) is somewhat sidelined, which is a shame because Keynes is the strongest actor among those portraying the Narnian monarchs. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIt is the acting that is perhaps the weakest link of the movie. Although they have improved since their last outing, the other Pevensies seem to be fairly stiff as if they are just going through the motions. Barnes fares a little better. His accent is passable and swagger effective, but at times he seems somewhat emotionless. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe film whizzes along at a comfortable pace, with a good balance of darkness, humour, action and quieter, character driven moments. But at over two hours, you have to question whether there is enough to hold the attention of children. Overall, I found this to be a thoroughly enjoyable romp that has left me eagerly awaiting the next instalment, <i>The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader</i>, which is due to hit the big screen in 2010. In the mean time, I have some wardrobes to climb into, some train stations to loiter expectantly at and perhaps even a painting to examine!\r\n	4	2011-03-26	589	2011-03-26
590	1	1	\N	Man on Wire	<p>\r\nMan on Wire is a documentary telling the daredevil tale of Philippe Petit, a 23 year-old wire-walker realising his 6 year long dream of wire-walking between the twin towers almost as soon as it had been built (back in the 70s). It takes the viewer on a chronological journey of how the stunt came to be, all the problems and tensions that occured, the setbacks, the errors, the meticulous, and the not so meticulous planning told through all the voices of the key team involved.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThere's a really interesting style to the documentary that seamlessly changes between present day story-telling to excellent original footage of the hotchpotch gang who were involved in the plot, and some staged footage to portray certain parts of the story. All of these were treated quite differently, sometimes feeling like a charlie chaplin movie, other times feeling like Jackanory but always working together to tell the story of Philippe's life in a humourous, light-hearted and touching way.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nPhilippe is absolutely enchanting and without it ever getting too emotional, the true dedication and love he has for wire-walking, his real passion in life, truly comes across in a most fascinating way. The emotional journey that all the members of the group went on comes across strongly, it really is a human tale but not one that ever gets too heavy or deep enough to put you off watching through to the end. Petit is one of the best story tellers I've had the pleasure to watch in a long time and someone that transfixed you whenever he was on screen, be that when he was 100 metres up doing his next daring wire-walk or talking about the plotting of the twin towers wirewalk itself. His inability to sit down while telling parts of the story was both amusing and encompassing, preferring to act out his tale rather than describing it. Philippe does eclipse to a certain extent the other characters, the team that made the escapade attainable for Philippe, normally this would be a shame, but they are all in his shadow and to a certain extent are choosing and are knowlingly in this position. The story, the footage, the film, is ultimately about Philippe's dream and you really get a feel that they feel the same way, they are here to tell Philippe's story, and are perfectly happy to do that.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nEven though much of Philippe's character becomes evident as the documentary develops, we don't find out all about him, in fact he is quite the criminal, having been arrested for pick-pocketing and conning people over 500 times. He isn't just a wire-walker but a circus artist, an acrobat, a a street juggler and a pick-pocket. From an early age he always had dreams of doing something that pushed the boundaries, something that nobody else could do. His first project certainly wasn't the twin towers, with some of the same team he planned and completed wirewalks on Notre Dame and the Sydney Harbour Bridge, all drawing huge attention, but like a drug, Philippe wanted to complete bigger and better stunts. He first envisaged his real challenge 6 years before it occured, when he found out about the twin towers being built. As far as he was concerned, those towers were built for him.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nHis judgement of people was probably not quite as hot as his talents on the wire, and we meet some dubious characters who become involved in the 'coup', all admitting to plenty of extra-curricular activites, some staying the distance, others falling by the wayside. They all add further colour to an already vibrant tale.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nUnsurprisngly 'Man on Wire' has been critically acclaimed and won 2 awards at the recent Sundance Film Festival, both the Audience Award and Grand Jury Prize in the World Documentary Competition. It was successful again at the Full Frame Documentary Festival winning another Audience Award and a Jury Prize. It's certainly a breath of fresh air from the usual subject matter surrounding the twin towers, and in many ways celebrates the towers for what they used to be known for. This film is a great tale showing a really touching human story, people really pushing the limits and ultimately having fun. A great and simple yarn that draws you in until the end.  </p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	590	2011-03-26
592	1	4	\N	Baby Mama	<p>\r\nEver since reading about a magical world filled with kings and queens, magic, mythical creatures and epic battles between good and evil, I have been <p>\r\nBaby Mama is about a business woman Kate (Tina Fey - 30 Rock {TV}), who like many career driven women has managed to put her personal life on hold, that is until one morning when her biological clock wakes her up with a loud siren.  The problem is there's no more time for her to press the snooze button. </p><p>\r\nAt the age of 37, Kate finds out that her chance of becoming pregnant is somewhere in the region of a million-to-one, so she seeks alternative solutions. The idea she settles on is getting herself a surrogate mother, and by going through an agency run by the overtly nice but slightly shifty Chaffee Bicknell (Sigourney Weaver - WALL.E) Kate is chosen / chooses Angie (Amy Peohler - The Mighty B! {TV]) to be the baby mama. All would be fine if the two weren't like chalk and cheese, and between Angie having split from her boyfriend and Kate wanting to keep the young reckless Angie on the straight and narrow thus giving her baby the best possible start in life, Kate takes the wild girl in. And boy does this girl come with her own sack load of issues. \r\n</p><p>The film focuses on the struggle of the two opposites having to come together in preparation for the arrival of the baby  but without wanting to spoil it, a spanner is thrown in the works which, once revealed, makes the film become predictable. Plus Kate finally gets a little bit of love-interest, which is quite sweet. \r\n</p><p>This film was sweet and touching, without being overly emotional, so not strictly for girlie viewing only. Although the film is like many all American rom-coms, there are a few supporting actors that make this film a delight. Firstly there's Oscar (Romany Malco - The Love Guru), the black doorman, who becomes a bit of a confidant and provides some of the best one-liners. Then there's the cameo from Steve Martin (The Pink Panther), who plays Kate's hippy boss Barry, complete with long white ponytail, who has his own kooky persona. </p><p>\r\nIf I was to liken this film to anything out there at the moment, I would probably compare it to <i>Juno</i> but in a traditional American sweet rom-com style.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	592	2011-03-26
593	1	15	\N	The X Files - I Want To Believe	<p>\r\nHaving waited an entire decade since making the original X-Files film it seems unusual that Chris Carter decided to reintroduce his iconic creation to the big screen with a story so mundane. \r\n</p><p>\r\nFormer FBI agent Scully (Gillian Anderson - Straightheads) is now working as a doctor, dealing with a particularly traumatic case of a sick teenager who has little hope of recovery, while Mulder (David Duchovny -Trust the Man) has become a recluse who continues to obsess over the paranormal. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nWhen a current FBI agent is kidnapped and the only lead the agency have are the visions of a psychic ex-priest (Billy Connolly - The Last Samurai) the pair are invited back to consult on the unusual case. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nWhile the first film focused on the TV series' labyrinth like alien invasion/conspiracy plot this film avoids all close encounters and looks to the spiritual for its supernatural twist. Maybe budget constraints are to blame or the Indiana Jones crew had already filled up this summer's quota of extra terrestrials but nothing weird enough happens to make this fairly dull kidnapping thriller stand out as an X-Files movie. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nFor a summer blockbuster the film's pacing is too slow, the villains are unthreatening and there are almost no action scenes apart from a brief foot chase. The plot suffers from too many lapses in logic and at times lurches into the ridiculous. Particularly galling is the moment that Scully uses Google as her first point of call for medical research before doing presumably complicated experimental procedures on her patient and then unwittingly breaks the case. Evil doers should avoid leaving their evil schemes on the internet in case unwitting ex-government employees stumble upon them. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nAudiences who spent much of the television show's initial run wondering whether Mulder and Scully would finally break with the formalities and succumb to their mutual attraction will be pleased to know that here the pair are a couple but they sadly spend much of the film separated dealing with different plots. When they are together, much like the rest of this exercise, they fail to ignite the old spark. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nNot for the first time this year old acquaintances have been revived for new cinematic adventures only to disappoint fans. <i>The X-Files: I Want to Believe</i> ranks only as an extended episode of the original series that stands well below its greatest moments.\r\n</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	593	2011-03-26
595	1	20	\N	The Mummy - The Tomb of the Dragon Emperor	<p>\r\nAfter a long time away from the big screen Brendan Fraser is back in a brief spat of new movies. Following the recent release of the movie <i>'Journey to the Centre of the Earth'</i>, Fraser also stars in a belated third instalment in the <i>'Mummy'</i> franchise.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAkin to his superior comparator Indiana Jones, the fearless adventurer O'Connell is semi enjoying retirement in the countryside when destiny drags him back for a new quest. Sadly, as weak as the latest Indiana Jones movie was, it pisses all over this movie and frankly shouldn't have been made. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe effects are poor, the story laughable, and the whole concept very tired. In fact when we went to see this film the most interesting moments were when an inquisitive fly decided to crawl over the lens casting amusing shadows on the screen, and the moment when my seat unexpectedly collapsed during one of the movie's syrupy love scenes.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe general premise in this latest instalment sees the retired O'Connells asked to deliver a priceless Chinese artefact to China where unbeknown to them their wild son, Alex (Luke Ford - Hercules [TV]), now a young budding archaeologist, has just located the tomb of a tyrannical emperor (Jet Li - War) who was cursed and cast in clay.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe O'Connells hope to deliver the artefact and patch things up with their little tearaway but of course it all goes Pete Tong. The project leader caring for strapping young Alex uses the magical powers of the artefact to resurrect the recently discovered ceramic baddie. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIn a flurry of questionable CGI effects the villain is awoken and his super powers revealed. He can breathe fire, freeze things and has a chariot powered by bronze horses. His dastardly plan is simple, use a sacred diamond to locate Shangri La, bathe in some magical oil of Olay and then take over the world...yawn.\r\n</p><p>\r\nTo add depth to this bird bath of a script they throw in the oh-so-clever parallels between reckless father and reckless son (also probably a cheaper hero for subsequent spin offs), a budding love story with a mysterious weakly acted heroine, and shows how a retired couple can rekindle the excitement in their later years through violent war with terracotta zombies.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe concept is probably sound, hence the studio funded it, but the problems soon outweigh the bonuses. Chief among these are the special effects, the downfall of <i>'The Mummy Returns'</i> comes back to knee this film in the goolies before the opening credits have even finished. \r\n</p><p>\r\nOne scene of the script probably described an emperor being slowly turned into clay before ravaging fire turns him into a terracotta warrior. What we actually see is a wooden actor turning into a partially melted chocolate bunny suffering from projectile vomiting who then fizzes like a cheap sparkler and turns into a garden ornament. "Oooo, scary"\r\n</p><p>\r\nNext problem is the script, it is terrible. Next problem is the casting, Maria Bello (A History of Violence) is a good American actress, which basically means she is not the very English Rachel Weisz (The Fountain). Add to this the casting of Luke Ford (Hercules [TV]) as Alex who at 27 years old looks more like Brendan Fraser's (40 years old) buddy than a possible son.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAdding it all together the film is a mess and falls far short of even the poor 'The Mummy Returns' and hopefully puts one final nail in the coffin of this franchise. Alas the premise of the cursed CGI critters returning to haunt us probably mirrors the decision making of the studio execs and we'll probably have to endure another acrid guff like the breath of the undead sometime in the near future.</p>\r\n	1	2011-03-26	595	2011-03-26
597	1	20	\N	Hellboy II - The Golden Army	<p>Once upon a time an evil madman helped the Nazis open a portal to hell hoping to bring about an apocalypse. Fortunately the Americans arrived just in time killing the bad guy and saving the day, right? The portal was open just long enough for something small to scurry through, a baby. The baby had red skin, horns, and a tail. The baby was nicknamed 'Hellboy' and he grew to become a very different kind of hero. </p><p>\r\nBack in 2004 director Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth) was relatively unknown in the West. He had turned a few heads with the successful <i>'Blade II'</i> but it wasn't until he released <i>'Hellboy'</i>, based on the graphic novels of Mike Mignola, that his name became synonymous with monsters. The movie wasn't the huge success studios hoped but did become a big hit with the fans. Four years later and riding high from the success of Pan's Labyrinth, Guillermo returns with more budget and audiences expectations are high. </p><p>\r\nSet a few years later, Hellboy (Ron Perlman - Hellboy) is living with fire starter girlfriend Liz (Selma Blair- The Fog) and his psychic amphibian friend Abe Sapien (Doug Jones - Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer). </p><p>\r\nOne night the team are summoned to investigate a massacre at an auction. When they arrive they find no survivors and only narrowly escape after a swarm of vicious tooth fairies attack. The auction was due to sell a fragment of an ancient crown. Legend has it that when the fragments of the crown are reunited, whoever wears the crown will be able to awaken the golden army, an unstoppable legion of violent golden robots. </p><p>\r\nSo by now you can probably get the general gist, evil prince wants to steal the crown, unleash the army and take over the world. Add in a few romantic dilemmas and quite a lot of action and you're set for a fun filled movie. </p><p>\r\nThe first movie was good fun and bursting with visual flair and its only real weakness was the lack of any real menace from the baddies. The sequel improves on the original adding a bucket load of wit, weird creatures and upping the tempo. Sadly the villain, Prince Nuada (Luke Goss - Blade II) is burdened with a fairly one dimensional character. He has physical prowess and obviously looks good flying around hacking people to pieces but despite efforts to add depth to the character it didn't really connect. Acting was ok from the former Bros boy, I just think the story was more focused elsewhere. </p><p>\r\nReturning to the screen is Ron Perlman and Doug Jones. Both actors seem doomed to rarely reveal their real faces, trapped in a world of voice over work or heavy prosthetics. Fortunately despite the heavy makeup both put in great performances especially in one scene where both lads drown their sorrows and listen to some music between the numerous action sequences. </p><p>\r\nIf you enjoyed the first Hellboy movie, and wasn't put off by the over the top nature of the concept then this film is great fun. The action has improved, the effects are good, and all the wit and flair of the original has carried over and expanded adding more depth to the world of Hellboy. Fingers crossed we'll see a further sequel (and there certainly were enough hints). </p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	597	2011-03-26
598	1	18	\N	Cass	<p>\r\n<b>Cass</b>, set in the 1970's and 1980's, is based on the true-life story of hooligan gang leader Cass Pennant. The biography is an incredible insight into the life of the most notorious football gang leader in British history and his struggle to free himself from a life of violence. As a hard-hitting gangster film it really does pack a punch. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe film opens with Cass (Nonso Anozie - Atonement) being shot at point blank range by a rival gang member outside a south London club. It then cuts to 1950's East London where life begins for Jamaican born baby Carol adopted from Bernardo's by an elderly white couple. Bullied as a child, young Pennant adopts the name Cass and like the boxer Cassius Clay he develops a more violent nature, earning the respect of fellow like-minded supporters of his beloved West Ham United.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFinding the only place he really belongs, Cass works his way up the ranks to become the gang leader of infamous hooligan gang The Intercity Firm (The ICF). Credit must be given to director and scriptwriter Jon S Baird (It's a Casual Life and Green Street) for making a film that is not afraid to delve into the issues of racism and gang violence. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhile the violence that typified the 'beautiful game' of the 1980's forms a vital part of the film it does not detract from the story, which at its very heart is about a man's struggle to form his identity and free himself from the clutches of gang related violence. The script is well written and very much captures the essence of the 1980's, as Cass bluntly states fighting is merely something for young men to do on a Saturday afternoon.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nHigh praise is also given to Anozie for playing the lead. As a burly 6 foot five black man psychotic in his rage, he does a very convincing role of a gang leader. A credit to his background in Shakespearean theatre Anozie has an almost effortless ability to act out his conflicting inner battles showing his struggle to fight against his conscious as he falls in love and begins to carve out a new life for his family. \r\n</p><p>\r\nUnfortunately, the supporting cast members do not leave a similar such impression and I left feeling that many of the relationships were under developed. The love interest in particular is somewhat unconvincing and the role of Elaine (Nathalie Press - My Summer of Love) could be likened to a particular Catherine Tate character. \r\n</p><p>\r\nCass is a very watchable gritty tale unafraid to tell a story that at its heart is inspiring without trying to give any justification for football violence. With a clever soundtrack of punk and ska it resonates the gangster feel of Lock Stock, while remaining biographical and authentic.

601	1	23	\N	RocknRolla	<p><i>"What I've tried to do is amalgamate all these disparate journeys and personalities, which connect to one big whole"</i> says Guy Ritchie of his latest by-the-numbers crime opus <b>RocknRolla</b>.\r\n<p></p>\r\nSteady on, this ain't Shakespeare, mate, as one of his own mockney characters might put it. But Guy's not done, <i>"Inevitably there are connections, but they go through circuitous pathways from the upper tier to the lower and back again. \r\nWe wanted to represent different facets of our society who are embroiled in this large-scale scam." </i><p></p>\r\nYou would have thought from these pseudo-philosophical musings that RocknRolla was a work of great artistic importance, a crime epic on the same lofty plain as the likes of <i>Heat</i>, <i>Rififi</i> or <i>The Killing</i>. It isn't. <p></p>\r\nAlthough it's nothing like as pretentious as Ritchie's previous effort <i>Revolver</i>, it's still painfully self indulgent, overwrought and over-long.\r\nThe ambitious plot, which attempts to mix high-stakes power play in London's corrupt property market with Ritchie's familiar cast of cardboard cut-out geezers, is too complex and illogical for its own good. It gets bogged down in twists and turns and then falls flat on its face when it tries to pause and let the characters develop. <p></p>\r\nOne scene, where rock star on the run Johnny Quid (Toby Kebbell - Matchpoint) - who is the step-son of Tom Wilkinson's (Michael Clayton) central mob boss Lenny Cole - sits at a pub piano and reflects on life, is almost unwatchable. <p></p>\r\nThat's not because Kebbell is bad - he's actually one of the best things in the film, managing to make the manic, drug-addled and violent rocker strangely likeable. It's just that the quality of the writing is so poor when the characters aren't wisecracking or threatening each other. <p></p>\r\nFor all its flaws, RocknRolla does have some good moments. The opening 15 minutes are excellent, as the story is set up over chunky guitar riffs, stylish cartoon character intros and pacy editing. <p></p>\r\nTom Wilkinson is also typically superb as Lenny, the self-styled villain from the 'old school'. He's the capital's Mr Fix when it comes to greasing the wheels of power to get things built fast with no questions asked. <p></p>\r\nWhen jobbing hoods One Two (Gerald Butler - 300) and Mumbles (Idris Elba - Prom Night) who call themselves The Wild Bunch - approach Lenny with a deal, he gleefully stitches them up, leaving the small timers owing him a huge wad of cash. <p></p>\r\nMeanwhile, shady Russian billionaire Uri (Karel Roden - Bathory) comes to Lenny with a huge-money proposition. These two plots soon intersect with the introduction of beautiful and bored accountant Stella (Thandie Newton - Run Fat Boy Run), who has links to One Two and works for Uri. Things get even messier when a 'lucky' painting that Uri lends Lenny goes missing. <p></p>v\r\nJust like <i>Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</i> and <i>Snatch</i>, RocknRolla is at its best when the sound is turned up and the action is hard and fast. <p></p>\r\nA cracking chase, where One Two and Mumbles hold up two of Uri's ultra-hard Russian bagmen, is RocknRolla's most entertaining set-piece. It's unrelentingly violent, stylish and exciting and as good as anything the director has done. Ritchie cleverly keeps cutting from the chase to the sterile civility of a restaurant, where One Two is explaining how it all went down to Stella.\r\n<p></p>\r\nThe action shows Ritchie at his best, but the actual relationship between One Two and Stella is him at his worst. There's absolutely zero chemistry between the pair. Although Newton looks and sounds the part as the posh totty on the hunt for a bit of rough, the character is as clichd as it sounds.\r\n<p></p>\r\nAs badly written as Newton's character is, it pales in comparison with the uncomfortable homophobia that Ritchie seems insistent on shoehorning into his films. One of the worst moments is a 'come-out' scene from one of the mobsters which is played for laughs, but is tasteless and offensive. \r\n<p></p>\r\nMost uncomfortable of all in this is Gerald Butler, who struggles to bring the same sort of humour and humility that Jason Statham brought to a similar role in Snatch. One Two's just there to move the plot along; he brings little else to RocknRolla. <p></p> \r\nThe same can be said of Mumbles. Idris Elba is hideously wasted in this underwritten role. There are hints of the excellence he showed as drug boss Stringer Bell in the American TV series The Wire, but he barely gets anything to do here. <p></p>\r\nDespite its interesting performances and good moments, you have to wonder what Ritchie will do next. RocknRolla finishes with a presumptuous set-up for a sequel, but doesn't do enough to warrant further attention. You simply don't care enough about anyone in the film to watch them for any longer. </p>\r\n\r\n	2	2011-03-26	601	2011-03-26
605	1	27	\N	Tropic Thunder	<p>\r\nThe long running ad campaign and the big name stars have raised the expectation for this Hollywood satire and war comedy cross breed. After some previous humdrum directorial efforts such as <i>'The Cable Guy'</i> and <i>'Zoolander'</i>, Ben Stiller finally makes what looks to be a smash hit. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe story is summed up in the advert really. Four pampered neurotic celebrities shooting a war movie inadvertently stumble into a real conflict zone and have to work as a team to escape. Fortunately, unlike most comedies, the best jokes are not ruined by the adverts. \r\n</p><p>\r\nBen Stiller plays Tugg Speedman, an action movie star watching his career take a downturn, yearning to be recognised as a serious actor in the war movie 'Tropic Thunder'. Joining him for the ride is acclaimed Australian actor Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jnr - Iron Man) who has gone so far as to have his skin surgically pigmented so he can act the part of the Black Sergeant.  These two actors lead the story and their competition to prove acting prowess drives the movie's earlier scenes.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nAlso on the shoot we meet an overweight drug addict comedian (Jack Black - Be Kind Rewind), a successful pretty boy R&B artist (Brandon T. Jackson - newcomer), and a weedy wannabe Sandusky (Jay Baruchel - Knocked Up), each trying to break away from their stereotypes. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe movie's central stars shine brightly but are joined by a stellar cameo cast that includes Steve Coogan (Hot Fuzz) as a distraught director, Danny R. McBride (Pineapple Express) as a pyromaniac special effects guy,  Matthew McConaughey (Fools Gold) as the ambitious Hollywood agent with a conscience, Nick Nolte (The Spiderwick Chronicles)as the ever grizzled war hero, Bill Hader (Superbad) as the ass kissing executive, and Tom Cruise (Lions for Lambs) in a career redefining role as.....(I'm not saying!)\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe strength in this movie is the wide array of characters that crop up. The lead characters are nice satirical knocks at celebrity and the movie does give each chap a bit of a story but the real selling point that raises this movie above a 2 star rating is the cameo cast. Somehow Stiller has managed to create a wide menagerie of characters that each has their own story. These little roles, added to the core story of the misplaced megastars, transformed a fun comedy into something more special.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBefore we get all hyped up about this movie, let us not get carried away. There are some slow sections that drag proceedings down a little and then there is the occasional misplaced joke. You may have read that the movie has angered many because of some of the jokes about less-able people. These complaints centre on one particular scene where Stiller and Downey discuss how to act mentally handicapped in an unsympathetic and inconsiderate way. I personally thought it went a bit far but I leave that to you to decide.\r\n</p>\r\n	9	2011-03-26	605	2011-03-26
609	1	23	\N	Fears of the Dark	<p>\r\nHarsh winds whistle across a barren landscape, rendered in shifting, scratchy monochrome. A pair of ornate, buckled and heeled shoes clips with menace on the rocky plain. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe snarling, skeletal owner of the shoes, complete with tri-corner hat, hones into view being pulled by a pack of savage black dogs. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nHe spies a hollow-eyed child who futilely turns to run as one of the dogs tears free to attack. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nWelcome to the macabre world of Fear(s) of the Dark, an unsettling collection of French language black and white shorts that are chilling and exquisitely drawn, each with its own distinctive style.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThe scrawled lines of Blutch's short and not very sweet segments featuring the madman with the ferocious dogs - which recur throughout the film - contrast with the precision of the animation of the four longer sections.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nFirst up is legendary American cult cartoonist Charles Burns' creepy story of a geeky teen whose obsession with bugs is turned against him. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThis itchy tale of bodily infestation is drawn like a wholesome 1950s American comic book, making the malevolence of its subject matter all the more effective. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nAppetites for David Fincher's mooted adaptation of Burns' classic graphic novel Black Hole will be well and truly wet by this deliciously poisonous morsel. \r\nSimilarly unsettling is the dialogue free final section. Richard McGuire uses pitch blacks and snippets of brilliant white to create a palpable sense of claustrophobia as an unnamed man is imprisoned in a remote house. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nAlthough it lacks the slow burning creep factor of the other stories, Marie Caillou's tale of the new girl at school being haunted by the ghost of a samurai is easily the battiest section of Fear(s) of the Dark. Drawing heavily on Japanese anime, it's the weakest of the bunch in terms of storyline, but makes up for that in macabre imagery. \r\nGiant hypodermic needles, the pitter-patter of spiders walking on struggling human flesh, and multi-eyed women-serpents combine to make the almost unintelligible plot seem unimportant. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nBut the hint of willful obtuseness to this segment is the major problem with this otherwise brilliant collection.  As you might expect from grouping together some of the world of cartoon and animation's most leftfield practitioners, Fear(s) of the Dark does occasionally dip its toes into the waters of pretension. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThis is most irritating in the segments that separate the main stories, in which banal sixth-form poetry is recited over unimpressively shifting shapes. \r\nBut this hint of pomposity is tolerable when you consider the stunning work elsewhere. Fear(s) of the Dark is a must for any fans of art-house animation.  \r\n</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	609	2011-03-26
611	1	4	\N	Flawless	<p>\r\nIn true Titanic style, the film starts with an old lady, regaling her youth to a jumped up little up-start, in the form of a young female journalist who is looking for her next big scoop, with little appreciation for what woman had to endure in the 60s. The story hurtles straight back to London, around 1960 when the young Laura Quinn (Demi Moore - Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle) is a female executive working in a male dominated world. The company she works for is London Diamond (Lon Di), one of the world's leading suppliers of diamonds, but any sort of career is constantly hampered by the fact that Laura is a woman, regardless of the many fantastic ideas she comes up with.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBitter and disgruntled by being constantly overlooked for promotion by under-qualified men, Laura teams up with the resentful yet quiet unassuming janitor Hobbs (Michael Caine - The Dark Knight) who feels equally betrayed after committing his whole life to the company.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nBetween them they plan a heist, with Laura agreeing to take a handful of gems from the company's vault, enough to live a life of luxury without the company noticing anything is awry, while unbeknown to her Hobbs has his own agenda.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nA relatively gentle story, but the story was fast paced enough to keep you hooked. Even by combining the talents of these two big stars, both actors were understated, helping you to concentrate on the main storyline. Caine's ability to play this role as the leading man without his ego getting in the way highlights how this man's career has sustained longevity. Also the role for Caine was not too much of a stretch for him as he had to play a Cockney geezer in his 70s. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nMoore was great in her own right, enabling her to sharpen her teeth on this gritty role. Bringing these two actors together again, having last appeared in Blame It On Rio (1984), was an opportunity to see these two stars spark off each other. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the acting was flawless.... Cheesy, I know!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThe film was captivating, and was not what I was expecting as I thought it was going to be a simple robbery story, but as things took a turn for the worse, it all got a lot more complicated and exciting.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nIf you liked the <i>Bank Job</i> or <i>The Heist</i>, please take yourself along to the cinema for a peek at this film.\r\n<p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	611	2011-03-26
614	1	4	\N	Eden Lake	<p>\r\nThis new British horror film taps into society's fears. Gritty and real, maybe even too real, this film leaves you not only a little frightened but also a little annoyed, which means between the storyline and the edge-of-your-seat filming, the director has succeeded in getting a reaction and making us re-evaluate society in general. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe film starts off with a young man called Steve (played by the handsome Michael Fassbender: Hunger, Wedding Belles) who whisks his girlfriend Jenny (Kelly Reilly: He Kills Coppers), a nursery school teacher, away for a romantic weekend where he intends to propose to her.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nTaking her to a deserted lake that means something to him, the couple begin to relax, but the peace is soon disrupted by a gang of 'asbo' kids who have little respect for anyone, let alone adults. After asking them politely to turn their music down and keep their rabid dog under control, the kids take their lawlessness to the next level by resorting to vandalism and theft. In trying to reclaim his property a fight ensues, where Steve comes under attack before one of the yobs produces a knife. But in the kafuffle, the gang leader's dog accidentally gets stabbed, and that is when all hell breaks loose as the gang seek revenge in this cat and mouse horror. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nJenny runs off to try and get help, but when she finally does get into town, the parents are as bad as their offspring, with their "my kids wouldn't do that" mentality. Forget the horror aspect and impending death; this makes it even more infuriating to watch.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThis film really got my back up as it taps into the modern fear that society has about unruly kids, and the threat that gangs of kids have on law-abiding citizens and how there is little anyone can do to eradicate it. Combine this with the fact the couple are stuck in the depths of some scary dark woods, in the full knowledge that it would be virtually impossible to get out alive, all adds to the suspense. Think Blair Witch meets Blazing Squad.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nOther films in this genre include <i>Desperation</i> and <i>Fear</i>, so if you've enjoyed either of these two, then this film will be a great addition to your collection. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n	4	2011-03-26	614	2011-03-26
548	1	20	Blah	Vantage Point	<p>Vantage Point is a high speed thriller centering on an attempted assassination of the US president during a peace conference in Spain. The US president is shot shortly after taking to the stage. As the crowds begin to flee in panic the horror is intensified when a bomb destroys the entire stage killing countless civilians and security personnel.</p>\r\n<p>What sets this film one step aside from many other assassination plot thrillers is the method of storytelling employed. Instead of using a linear chronological order the director has instead chosen to shoot the movie as a montage of smaller simultaneous interconnected stories.</p> \r\n<p>The strength of this process is that it allows a greater scope for the otherwise clich story and makes you stumble from one perceived villain to the next. However the weakness is that after the fifth perception of the same event you are getting a little weary of the repetition.</p> \r\n<p>As each story centres on the perceptions of a particular character you'd hope that these characters are colourful or complex but sadly they are not. We have a tired once great secret service agent played by Dennis Quaid (American Dreams), a heartbroken tourist seeking inspiration (Forest Whitaker - The Last King of Scotland), a morally dubious TV producer who would sell her gran for a story (Sigourney Weaver - Be Kind Rewind) and a defiant, if under pressure, president (William Hurt - Into the Wild). Each of these and many more  show us their view on the crisis and each offers clues to the true villains working behind the scenes and it is only once the stories converge that this movie kicks into fifth gear and races to a conclusion. Sadly as the story races to a climax it thins out quicker than a contestant on 'America's next top model' and all characterisation becomes secondary to car chases and gunfire.</p>\r\n<p>Once again "Lost" star Matthew Fox tries to make a worthwhile leap into the big movies but again falls a bit flat, maybe he should give up and head back to that desert island after all. Fox doesn't have much to do and is easily overshadowed by veteran action star Quaid who reminds us how to do the clichs properly. Meanwhile Oscar winner Whitaker is fortunate to get one of the more interesting story arcs although it could have been explored maybe a little more or a little less happy in the end.</p> \r\n<p>So how do I sum up this movie? Each small story in itself isn't too great and the acting is passable. Thankfully when you bolt together the half dozen well trodden short stories you actually come up with an intriguing political thriller which is then catapulted into a guilty pleasure action finale.</p>\r\n<p>Despite my grumbles this is good fun entertainment and I'd recommend it to fans of the TV show 24, and movies such as 'Momento', 'The Sentinel' and 'In The Line of Fire'. </p>	3	2011-03-26	548	2012-03-08

The only laudable thing I can think to say is that the costume designer tried hard and the young leading star Drake Bell (High Fidelity?) gave it his all despite woeful material.\r\n</p>\r\nIf you like movies like <i>'Scary Movie'</i>, <i>'Epic Movie'</i> or <i>'Meet the Spartans'</i>, grow up! This film is only worth seeing if you have a really hot date who insists on watching it or if you've lost a bet and this is your punishment.	0	2011-03-26	578	2012-03-08
52	1	20	\N	Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy	<p>Hot on the heels of last month's sports comedy Dodgeball, September delivers us Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, written by and starring Will Farrell (Starsky & Hutch) as the greatest news reporter in San Diego's history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Set during the 1970's when media news was the exclusive domain of men with big hair and porn star moustaches, Ron Burgundy is a god in the news community. Adored by his audience and his colleagues, Ron enjoys the party life and the privileges of being 'king of the castle'. That is until he meets his match. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>One night at a pool party Ron's life is changed when his smooth advances on a young lady are rejected. To make things worse, while still recovering from his hangover Ron is further shocked to find out that the same lady, Veronica (Christina Applegate - Wonderland) has been hired to help his team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The office where men used to call the shots is ill prepared for this new challenge. As each reporter tries in vain to charm Veronica, Ron sees his chance. Can his cool moves melt the ice queen? While Ron works his charms on Veronica, his rivals from other networks see a possible weakness that will allow them to snatch the ratings. Ron's life, that was for a long time a lovely picnic, is rapidly turning into nightmare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What follows is the comedy exploits of Ron and his friends as they try to keep control of the office, subdue female emancipation and find true love. The movie has some truly memorable scenes including a cameo laden gangland showdown between rival news teams that soon escalates out of control and an energetic performance of the jazz flute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Will Farrell is on top form in this movie delivering an often surprising script full of great and bizarre dialogue. Against the outrageous character of Ron Burgundy, Christina Applegate is radiant and sharp as the ambitious wannabe anchorwoman trying to forge her career in a male dominated office.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>In support Steve Carrell (Bruce Almighty) is hilarious as the incredibly dumb weatherman and Pull Rudd (Romeo & Juliet) as Ron's closest friend, on location reporter and self-proclaimed sex god. Keep an eye out for some great cameos, the cameo counter nearly melts in this film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I went to see Anchorman with little idea of what it was about and I was pleasantly surprised. The comedy is mainly dialogue-based although there is some physical comedy as well. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed Dodgeball or Starsky & Hutch. A good all round crowd pleaser.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	52	2011-03-26
54	1	16	\N	Ladder 49	<p>Since the last true fireman flick, Backdraft (1991), the genre has fizzled out, most probably as a sign of respect to the many brave firefighters who lost their lives on September 11th. Ladder 49 has reinvigorated the genre with a balanced glance of both the camaraderie side of the job mixed in with the real danger and intensity of tackling fierce fires. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jack Morrison (Joaquin Phoenix - The Village) is trapped in a burning building, injured and lost in a labyrinth of fire, rubble and twisted metal. As he tries to save himself he looks back through his life, back to when he first joined the team of Captain Mike Kennedy (John Travolta - The Punisher) as a fumbling rookie. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the team of Ladder 49 fight to save Jack, he remembers the traditional initiation rights and pranks in his early days, the chance meeting with the beautiful Linda, falling in love, and eventually getting married. He remembers Linda's ongoing fears as he fought fires, the loss of friends, the injuries he himself received, all to save people from the flames. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joaquin Phoenix's performance in this new arena is a far cry from his recent stint in M Night Shyamalan's horrors and thrillers. Playing the central role, Phoenix puts in an emotional and brave performance. Alongside, Travolta plays a fatherly role as the protective captain with a sensitive yet slightly unconventional leadership nature. While other top performances include Jacinda Barrett (The Human Stain) as supportive wife Linda and Morris Chestnut (Anacondas 2) as Jack's friend Tommy.</p>  \r\n\r\n<p>Ladder 49 gives the audience a real insight into what firefighters have to go through on a daily basis, risking their lives for others, while still trying to have lives of their own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you like the recent TV fire drama 'Rescue Me' or used to enjoy 'London's Burning' then you'll enjoy Hollywood's latest big budget version.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	54	2011-03-26
55	1	16	\N	Man On Fire	<p>John Creasy (Denzel Washington - Out of Time) is an unemployed ex-CIA assassin who has given up on life and hits the bottle every night. That is until his friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken - The Stepford Wives) gives him a wake up call and convinces him to pull himself together and make something of his life. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a spate of kidnappings in Mexico City, Rayburn eventually persuades Creasy to apply for a job as a bodyguard. Even though Creasy knows he is not really up to the task he still takes on the job. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fairly soon Creasy is employed by the wealthy Ramos family to protect their young daughter, Pita (Dakota Fanning - The Cat In The Hat). Creasy is there to do his job and remain detached from the little girl but Pita perseveres and eventually gets close to the aloof Creasy, becoming friends. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Denzel Washington puts in a dark and emotional performance as washed out Creasy trying to salvage his life. Washington manages to revive himself in a much grittier role since his earlier days starring in The Pelican Brief and Philadelphia.  Dakota Fanning as Pita convincingly portrays an intelligent attention-starved girl. Other notable performances come from Rada Mitchell (Phone Booth) and Marc Anthony (Bringing Out The Dead) as Pita's parents. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Man on Fire is a dark graphic thriller filled with plenty of action, emotion and a truly gripping storyline. The mix of fast and slow camera movements and a booming soundtrack all add to the powerful plot of the film. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The relationship between hard man Creasy and doting Pita is slightly reminiscent of the bond between Mathilda (Natalie Portman - Star Wars: Attack of the Clones) and Leon (Jean Reno - Ronin) in Leon (1994). This is an action packed film with a deeply moving ending and I would recommend it to all action and thriller junkies.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	55	2011-03-26

Instead of biting the bullet and facing her fears, Wendy causes a scene in order to escape her close call with death and save a couple of her classmates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But instead of cheating death altogether, she has only delayed it.  Her school friends will die one-by-one in the order in which they were meant to be killed on the rollercoaster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using the photos she took at the fair and with the help of fellow survivor Kevin (Ryan Merriman - The Ring Two), Wendy starts to piece together the pattern and figures out how the deaths will happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a bid to save her friends, Wendy and Kevin try to warn their buddies about their fateful end but will she get to them before it is too late?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Final Destination 3 follows pretty much the same plot as its predecessors, except this time death has come after them on a rollercoaster.  The deaths are bloodier and more creative than the first and second film but yet the gore is not enough to elevate it to a higher status than the first film in the franchise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watch it if you like action, gore, thrills and chills but don't expect too many jumpy or unexpected scenes.  Fans of <i>Final Destination</i> and <i>Club Dread</i> will enjoy this movie.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	267	2011-03-26
62	1	16	\N	Open Water	<p>Inspired by true events, Open Water is a chilling tale of the most horrific holiday disaster you can imagine. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Susan (Blanchard Ryan - Super Troopers) and Daniel (Daniel Travis) finally take a break from their highly stressful lives to have a much-needed holiday on an exotic island. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The couple almost immediately seal their fate at the start of the movie when they book to take part in a diving expedition. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a miscount by one of the diving instructors, the crew believe they have accounted for all the tourists in the diving party and so they head back to shore. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile the couple return to the surface and find that the boat has left without them. At first they think it is just a simple mistake but after a few hours they realise they have been stranded in shark-infested waters. Can you imagine anything worse?\r\nAlone and adrift, the couple are slowly attacked by all manner of scary underwater creatures but the movie somehow fails to capture the sheer horror of the situation. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The performances of relative newcomers Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis are quite wooden and unemotional. The lack of fear on their faces for the majority of the film really does weaken the audience's attachment to the main characters. Similarly the camera work focuses mainly on the above surface action rather than the beasties below. Although this may have been intended to add some element of psychological horror, the effect just wasn't there. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Open Water was a real disappointment and it will definitely not satisfy the hardcore horror fans. The viewer hardly gets to experience the action underwater, merely the characters' reactions to it. This is less frightening even if it is intended to be more suggestive. Unfortunately while the concept behind this film is terrifying, the film isn't. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are a big fan of scary shark movies such as Jaws or Deep Blue Sea, avoid this film as it is wet in comparison. </p>\r\n	1	2011-03-26	62	2011-03-26

When Aladdin rubs the lamp he releases the all-powerful genie (voiced by Robin Williams - Jumanji) who grants him three wishes. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aladdin uses his wishes to disguise himself as a prince so that he may try and woo a princess who has captured his heart. However the evil Jafar has discovered the prince's true identity and the location of the lamp. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Filled with action, comedy and some great songs, Aladdin is arguably one of Disney's greatest animations and was one of the first of their films to utilise computer effects to heighten the picture quality. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>For kids, anyone who enjoys harmless fun, or any Disney fans, Aladdin is a must-see movie and will remain good on repeat viewing.</p> \r\n	4	2011-03-26	73	2011-03-26

This time the heat of the desert and the mysteries of Egypt have been replaced by monster horror and the wintry landscape of Transylvania. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Very loosely based on the character Abraham Van Helsing from Bram Stoker's Dracula, Van Helsing gives the tired old Dutch professor a revamp and turns him into a leather clad crossbow wielding action hero with a dark past full of mystery. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Set in the 19th century, the movie follows the adventures of monster slaying hero Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman - X-Men 2) and his geeky sidekick Carl (David Wenham - LOTR) as they travel to Transylvania to tackle their most intimidating opponents yet and possibly unravel some of the mystery of Van Helsing's past. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>On arriving in Transylvania they soon meet up with the beautiful and courageous Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale - Underworld) who informs them they have more than one enemy to hunt. In Transylvania, the evil Count Dracula with his three brides and his slave, the Wolfman, are spreading terror across the land. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Van Helsing is full of special effects, action and a certain amount of comedy. As homage to the cheesy hammer horror movies of yesteryear it is entertaining enough though the overly convoluted story, far fetched action sequences and some terrible accents do start to grate after a while. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The highlight of the movie must be Richard Roxburgh's camp eccentric performance as the boo-hiss sinister Count Dracula and the eloquent and lumbering mass that is Frankenstein's monster. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This movie doesn't aim high and therefore hits its target. I'd recommend this movie to young kids seeking a brainless action film or any fan of The Mummy or Mummy Returns.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	74	2011-03-26
453	1	23	\N	My Best Friend	<p>\r\nThis classy comedy from veteran French director Patrice Leconte manages to make poignant points about adult friendships while still feeling light and amusing. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDaniel Auteuil is Franois, an affluent antique dealer who values beautiful inanimate objects over human affection. His business partner Catherine (Julie Gayet) chides him for having no friends and wagers he cannot prove her wrong by a certain date. \r\n</p><p>\r\nMy Best Friend's premise initially feels clunky and contrived, but once chirpy taxi driver Bruno - who Franois hires to teach likeability - takes a central role, the charm of Dany Boon's performance permeates every scene. The fact-obsessed cabby, whose amiable demeanour masks a crippling lack of confidence, is the film's beating heart. \r\n</p><p>\r\nLike My Best Friend's performances, Patrice Leconte's direction is classy and never over-the-top. He makes great use of lighting to convey his characters. One superlative shot has Bruno chatting easily with Franois' resentful daughter in the orange glow of the antique dealer's kitchen, while the man of the house is a stranger in his own home, lingering in icy blues in the corridor. \r\n</p><p>\r\nJust like any friendship of true value, My Best Friend's characters and direction will stay long in the mind.\r\n</p>	4	2011-03-26	453	2011-03-26
76	1	16	\N	Super Size Me	<p>Morgan Spurlock, director and star of movie documentary Super Size Me, embarks on a McDonalds only diet for 30 days. His aim is to identify the possible side effects caused by eating a staple diet of fatty burgers, salty fries and sugary drinks. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Morgan starts off the film with a trip to three different doctors who all give him a clean bill of health and do not foresee any disastrous consequences arising from the challenge. Morgan also consults a nutritionist who keeps a log of his calorie and vitamin intake and any weight changes along the way. Then the audience is introduced to his girlfriend, a strict vegan, who is finding it hard to come to terms with why Morgan is taking on this meaty challenge. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>During his 30-day binge Morgan has to abide by a few simple rules. </p>\r\n<p>\r\n1.\tHe must eat a McDonalds meal three times a day.<br>\r\n2.\tHe must eat every choice on the menu at least once within the 30 days.<br>\r\n3.\tIf asked whether he would like to 'Super Size' his meal, he must do so.<br>\r\n\r\n<p>As Morgan embarks on his challenge the documentary takes time to meet various industry experts who talk about the growing problem of obesity in America and the general lack of exercise or balanced diet in the population as a whole. </p>\r\n\r\nAs Morgan discusses different aspects of the obesity epidemic the documentary provides updates of Morgan's progress with the McDonald's diet. The effects of the diet are in a word, shocking. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the last year or so, there has been a spate of emotive and informative film documentaries such as Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine and Fahrenheit 9/11.  Each film has a message that needs to be heard but pushes the boundaries of controversy in doing so. </p>  \r\n\r\n<p>Super Size Me is a really informative and engaging documentary that will definitely give you some food for thought. If you need an excuse to ditch the fries and do some more exercise then this film should push you in the right direction.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	76	2011-03-26
84	1	26	\N	Taxi	<p>Movies about taxi drivers being placed in intense situations are like taxis: you wait ages for one (Collateral) and then two come along at once. Like deliberately missing the first one in order to take the second, Taxi will get you where you want to go but is somewhat pointless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Belle Williams (Queen Latifah - Bringing Down the House) is a speed demon. Flying through the streets of New York in her tricked-out taxi, she has earned a reputation as New York's fastest cabbie. However, her real dream is to be a race car champion. She is well on her way until her plans are derailed by overeager cop Andy Washburn (Jimmy Fallon - ??), who is, by contrast, totally inept behind the wheel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Washburn, whose recent mishaps have landed him in the precinct doghouse, is chasing a gang of beautiful Brazilian bank robbers, led by Vanessa (Gisele Bundchen). To catch them, license-less Washburn convinces Belle to team up with him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hence two mismatched people are forced to work together and you've all seen enough films to know the rest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are things to like here. The chemistry between Fallon and Latifah is certainly there; the car chases are original and thrilling, boding well for Tim Story's next project (The Fantastic Four); Bundchen performs her job well of looking sexy and being Brazilian (funny that), and the comedy set pieces are well constructed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem is that the film never really finds its tone. Fallon's transition from incompetent to brilliant is too extreme to be taken even slightly seriously and yet he just isn't funny enough for this to be viewed as pure comedy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of a recent glut of remakes of foreign films that had decent releases in the first place, this is one that has been turned from an original thriller into a passable but unremarkable buddy comedy.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	84	2011-03-26
86	1	16	\N	Anacondas - The Hunt For The Blood Orchid	<p>If you are terrified of snakes I suggest you go and see this film. It makes a complete mockery of how frightening these creatures can be so it should sure your phobia in no time! </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continuing on from the first film, a group of young (not forgetting good looking) professionals and scientists travel into the jungle of Borneo on an expedition. Led by Dr Jack Byron (Matthew Marsden - Coronation Street [tv]), the group are searching for the rare and priceless blood orchid, which holds the key to prolonged life. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with every adventure a whole host of dangers are soon revealed. Not only does the group have to brave the rainy season and treacherous rivers to locate the flower but it seems a menacing species has also discovered the blood orchids potential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you've seen the original movie, or any other monster flick for that matter, then you know the deal. One by one each member of the group is killed off by the menacing anacondas and only a select few will complete the mission. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The acting in this film is nothing to write home about, mainly due to the lack of big names and lack or personalities but I must give credit to Eugene Byrd (8 Mile) who saved the film from being completely dire with his funny one liners and likeable character. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I had high hopes for this sequel (not sure why) but I was thoroughly disappointed, especially as it seems the filmmakers are still using the same awful effects used ion the original. With such obviously computer generated snakes all you can expect from this film is a few jumpy moments and cheap scares. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anacondas 2: The Hunt For The Blood Orchid, pales in significance compared to its predecessor. But if you like over-the-top monster horrors like Godzilla or Lake Placid then you may enjoy this film.</p>\r\n	1	2011-03-26	86	2011-03-26
91	1	16	\N	The Grudge	<p>When a spirit is enraged and full of fury, anyone who comes into contact with it must be prepared to incur its wrath and what could be more frightening than a woman with a grudge?</p>\r\n<p>Created by the same director as the original Japanese horror, Ju-On, Takashi Shimizu retains the films traditional setting of Japan despite having the feel of a Hollywood remake.</p>\r\n<p>Unlike similarly veined Japanese Horror/Hollywood remakes such as The Ring, The Grudge only features a select few Hollywood big names while including a majority Asian cast.</p>\r\n<p>The Grudge tells the story of a Japanese house stained with a curse. A young student nurse, Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar - Scooby Doo 2) is called to the house to care for an elderly lady, Emma (Grace Zabriskie - Gone in 60 Seconds) following the mysterious disappearance of her former helper, Yoko.</p>\r\n<p>As soon as Karen enters the house she becomes embroiled in the evil that is lurking there. Instead of giving in to the curse, she sets out to discover the truth of what lies within the house.</p>\r\n<p>The story does not follow the normal route of storytelling but jumps from the present to the past to explain all aspects of the story in an unconventional yet effect way. This allows us to learn a little about what happened to Emma's absent family and also provide clues to the dark past of this troubled property.</p>\r\n<p>With only a minimal number of American cast members, namely the ever popular Gellar, Bill Pullman (Lost Highway) and Jason Behr (Roswell High[TV]), The Grudge manages to retain its roots as an original Japanese horror. The story ois engaging and full of suspense and will keep you on the edge of your seat.</p>\r\n<p>Fans of The Ring looking for more heart stopping scenes and sinister figures should look no further. If you thought the black-haired girl in The Ring was scary, you aint seen nothing yet. Be prepared.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	91	2011-03-26

Soon the murderer starts to home in on the staff embarking on a killing spree leaving behind a trail of dead bodies with clues and riddles strewn all over them.  But can the Pleasure Island staff figure out who dunnit?  What is the motive?  Why is the murderer only targeting staff?  Is there a pattern in the selection of victims?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As paranoia sets in, the staff members start to suspect each other.  Could it be nymphomaniac fitness instructor Jenny (Brittany Daniel - Sweet Valley High, The Basketball Diaries), tennis coach Putman, new masseur Lars with the midas touch, South American dive instructor Juan (Steve Lemme - Super Troopers, Puddle Cruiser), DJ Dave (Paul Soter - Super Troopers, Puddle Cruiser), fun policeman Sam or security guard Hank (MC Gainey - Terminator 3, Wonderland)?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Pleasure Island staff are eliminated one by one in mysterious manners, can the surviving members figure out the pattern before they become the next victim?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Five piece comedy group Broken Lizard (Chandrasekhar, Soter, Stolhanske, Lemme and Heffernan) put in great performances in the film while contributing to a hilarious script.  Other excellent performances came from Jordan Ladd (Cabin Fever, Never Been Kissed) as unbalanced nave club-goer Penelope and Lindsay Price (Beverly Hills 90210) as hysterical events manager Yu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you liked Scary Movie, Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer and Not Another Teen Movie, then you are guaranteed to love this movie.

Indeed the Polar Express promises some of the best computer animation ever seen. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The trailer for this movie suggest that this may be a very touching movie full of seasonal sweetness and the magic of Christmas. In fact the trailer does little to attract the older audience by comparison to the recent animation hits 'The Incredibles' or the upbeat comedy 'Shark Tale'.

Also a familiar supporting cast including Miriam Margolyes (The life & Death of Peter Sellers) brought humour and colour to this simple story while a fantastic musical score added to the mood of the movie. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cornwall and traditional English life is shown at its best and for anyone who enjoyed "Iris" or "Chocolat" this film is a "must do".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ladies in Lavender would not appeal to a teenage audience but for those who appreciate superb acting, music and scenery in preference to loud, violent, explosive films this film is highly recommended.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	98	2011-03-26

114	1	16	\N	Meet the Fockers	<p>After watching the cringey escapades of his first encounter with the in-laws, Greg "Gaylord" Focker (Ben Stiller - Dodgeball) returns to our screens in this hilarious sequel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Meet the Parents (2000), Gaylord wowed audiences with his tactless, clumsy and simply unfortunate behaviour.  If he wasn't busy setting his in-law's garden on fire, then he was giving his future sister-in-law a black eye and losing the family cat, Jinxie, all under the scrutiny of ex-CIA agent Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro - Shark Tale), father of his fianc.</p>  \r\n\r\n<p>Even after being subjected to a pretty harsh lie detector test by Jack and surviving humiliation after humiliation, a peace was finally reached and Gaylord remains determined to marry his precious Pam (Teri Polo - Meet the Parents).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meet the Fockers is a clash of the Titans - the uptight Byrnes family versus the quirky Fockers.  Gaylord tries his hardest to tone down his parents' unconventional ways but there is no way of hiding unemployed father Focker, Bernie (Dustin Hoffman - I Heart Huckabees) or sex therapist Roz Focker (Barbra Streisand - Mona Lisa Smile).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first there is a serious clash of personalities - Jack versus Bernie and even Jinxie versus the Fockers' dog Moses. But while the men clash horns, the ladies are more open minded and talk intimately about their marriages. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the Byrnes have brought along a new addition to the family, Pam's nephew Little Jack, another cause for much mayhem. Jack's military mind has constructed the seemingly perfect care scheme for the tot but Gaylord Focker really is the world's worst babysitter!  Then again, how can you deal with a baby that has a mind like a sponge and has mastered the art of sign language?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Great performances come from Hoffman as zany and free-spirited Bernie who provides much of the comedy along with Streisand who is fantastic as hippie-like senior sexuality specialist Roz. De Niro plays his part well as the stern and cold father-in-law with some great plot scenes to work with while wife Dina (Blythe Danner - Sylvia) and Polo hardly make an impact.  Not forgetting a truly cute and hilarious performance from Little Jack, great chase scenes from Jinxie and Moses and another cameo appearance from Owen Wilson (Starsky and Hutch) as jilted ex, Kevin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meet the Fockers has some great new comedic content and is just as, if not more, enjoyable than the first.  If you're a big fan of Stiller or the original Meet the Parents, you'll love this movie.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	114	2011-03-26

But who are the images behind the "white noise" and what kind of help are they asking for?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Michael Keaton, returning to the big screen, puts in an emotional performance as the distraught and grieving husband who is haunted by the past.  Keaton has been out of the limelight for several years and now plays a fatherly and dowdier role compared to his stint as the caped crusader.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are a true horror addict then don't expect much action in the first half of the film.  You'll find most of the chilling scenes towards the end of the movie so some horror junkies may find the pace of the film a little slow to start off with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White Noise features the usual ingredients for a typical supernatural thriller such as that seen in The Sixth Sense, Stir of Echoes, The Ring and Gothika.

131	1	15	\N	Vanity Fair	<p>Set against the sweeping balls of London society during the Napoleonic wars of the nineteenth century, Vanity Fair follows the attempts of Becky Sharp, an ambitious young governess, to escape her poor social standing and gain the attention she craves from those who have what she does not, wealth and influence.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Reese Witherspoon (Legally Blonde 2), speaking with a flawless English accent, gives a confident performance as the industrious Becky Sharp. Unfortunately the Becky that Witherspoon portrays on screen has only a limited connection to the manipulative and vindictive antihero of William Makepeace Thackeray's original literature.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Director Mira Nair (Monsoon Wedding) has instead created a lead character that is actually appealing to the audience. Becky is certainly ambitious in this film version, but it is an ambition that can be applauded, an ambition that stems from a need to be accepted and to escape one's impoverished beginnings rather than from any underlying greed.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>In this version of the tale, Becky is never directly responsible for the setbacks and calamities that befall her and those around her. She is a victim of unfortunate circumstances and of people who are even more unscrupulous than her.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Gabriel Byrne (The Usual Suspects) plays the Marquess of Steyne in the kind of predatory role that seems to come to him so naturally. Equally good are the rest of a talented cast of mostly British actors that include Bob Hoskins (Maid in Manhattan) as Becky's first employer and James Purefoy (Resident Evil) as Becky's flawed husband, Rawden.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Rather more damagingly than the re-imagining of the character of Becky is the quite unnecessary inclusion of Indian imagery that feels quite out of place within the setting of nineteenth century London high society. While the Indian flavoured clothes that the lead character wears are noticeable, it is the ridiculous Indian dance performed for the Prince Regent and the weird scene set back in India with Rhys Ifans (Notting Hill) that really jar the audience out of what is generally a smooth flowing narrative.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Despite these minor problems Vanity Fair's story is a classic one and the assured acting and sharp script insure that the flaws do not diminish a well made and enjoyable period film.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	131	2011-03-26
135	1	15	\N	Creep	<p>Horror fans are easy to please. They don't ask for much. They don't care about convincing characterisation or a coherent plot. In fact all they really look for in your bog standard slasher film amounts to little more than a lot of running around in the dark and some screaming. However, apart from the running and the screaming, all fans will agree that to make a successful horror a certain element must be present. The makers of Creep should now take out their notepads so they can write this fact down. Horror films should be horrifying!</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Fear not, all is not lost. The distributors of Creep still have time to change their advertising campaign and bill their London Underground slasher film as 2005's first great British comedy. I know that spending two hours on the underground is a horrifying everyday possibility to all you Londoners out there but the fictitious adventures of a hideously dressed commuter is actually a real hoot.</p> \r\n \r\n<p>Don't bother with Meet the Fockers, all the big laughs can be found in Creep. Where else can you expect to see that bloke with the designer stubble from Holby City being dragged off a tube to be ineffectively killed not once but twice by a pasty faced chap with curvature of the spine? In what other film will you find junkie tramps that have a better dress sense than the leading lady? Franka Potente's (Run Lola Run) yellow dress really is the only truly horrifying aspect of the film.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>The plot is essentially that dim commuter Kate (Potente) finds herself trapped overnight in an underground station after falling asleep except it turns out, would you believe it, she's not alone? Yes, there is a comically shuffling mutant hiding somewhere in the dark, but there is also a work colleague, a security guard, two tramps, several train drivers and a tunnel repair man all provided so that the comically shuffling mutant has someone else to butcher except the main character. If you see a girl dressed in custard screaming for help anywhere near Charing Cross station run like hell or your life will soon be forfeited.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Only the first appearance of the villain's milky bald head appearing out of the darkness is unsettlingly spooky while in terms of gore only the spot of unnecessary surgery was sufficiently sick.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Although the film is great for audience participation, 200 people in my screening were jeering at the screen every time Kate did something ridiculously stupid (roughly every two minutes), as a horror Creep is, quite frankly, crap.</p>\r\n	1	2011-03-26	135	2011-03-26
617	1	20	\N	Body of Lies	<p>\r\nEver looked at a picture you've seen a dozen times before and suddenly spotted something new that you hadn't noticed before? Does that make the picture better? Two questions I often find myself asking after watching a Ridley Scott movie.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOver the last few years Ridley has kept himself busy directing an eclectic array of movies. Ranging from the historic masterpiece <i>'Kingdom of Heaven'</i>, a film whose brilliance was only outshone by its poor reception, to the similarly under appreciated  drama <i> 'A Good Year'</i>, and finally the recent edgy thriller <i> 'American Gangster'</i>. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe films may appear different but they all have that certain feel common to Ridley Scott movies. They are visually impressive, have complex but subtle stories, and often are overlooked or critically panned at the time of release. To continue the trend Sir Ridley now presents <i> 'Body of Lies'</i>.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe story has quite a few layers but the central plot revolves around a CIA agent, Ferris (Leonard DiCaprio - Blood Diamond), based in  Iraq, who has to juggle real world confrontations while carrying out the orders of his fat comfy boss back in Langley, Hoffman (Russell Crowe - American Gangster).  \r\n</p><p>\r\nDuring a botched desert meeting with a possible defector Ferris manages to salvage some burnt CD's and paperwork but is blown up and shot in the process. Unable to return Ferris to Iraq, Hoffman instead reassigns him to a new post in Jordan where he can use the fresh data to track down the leader of a new radical terrorist cell. However to succeed Ferris must liaise with the head of the Jordan intelligence community, the infamous Hani (Mark Strong - Rocknrolla).\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe position is delicate as Ferris is constantly torn between his loyalty to the USA, and his new ally Hani. Hoffman's policy is shoot first ask questions later while Hani's methods are more slow burning but fruitful. Caught in the middle Ferris tries to play the game by his own rules with mixed results and all the while the terrorists are preparing their next act of aggression.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe war on terror looks like it is going to be a long fight and in response a new genre of political thriller has emerged. Body of Lies has multiple concurrent stories and a central lead trying to keep track of all the threads. For some this may make the film confusing, for others it is intriguing. As I alluded to in my opening sentence, this is one of those movies where each time you watch it you discover new little elements. However does this make it a good movie?\r\n</p><p>\r\nUnlike the action driven <i> 'The Kingdom'</i>, this film tries to use a multifaceted story to explore what is a real world political situation. The result is that the film doesn't hurtle along at a furious pace and the characters get more of a chance to connect with the audience.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAs the lead DiCaprio puts in a solid performance. True, he looks like he walked straight off the set of Blood Diamond into this movie; similar clothes, similar personality, but he is good nonetheless. As the middleman DiCaprio is the bridge between Crowe as an overweight and bullish CIA mission director with an awful southern drawl and the sharp and dominating Hani played brilliantly by Strong, a character akin to the Godfather in being merciless and cruel yet honorable and well mannered. Fingers crossed this movie will help raise Strong's star profile from pantomime villain (see 'Tristan + Isolde' or 'Stardust'), to lead actor.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe story is good and, aside from some dubious accents here or there, the acting is good. As always the Scott style permeates the whole project with stunning visual landscapes and set pieces and finally the short bursts of action are frantic and furious while the tense scenes do keep you on your toes. So what is not to like? The answer is simple, pace. Like most Ridley Scott films you have to watch and remember. The story isn't spoken, it is played out, and if you are not concentrating this film could be a chore. It's down to the comfort of your seat, frame of mind, and personal taste. Like <i>TK MAX X</i> this movie has it all if you're prepared to look for it.\r\n</p><p>\r\nPersonally I really liked this movie. It was an intelligent political thriller with more depth than most modern fare and left me thinking. I think this movie will grow better with repeat viewing and will complement well the existing expansive catalogue of Ridley Scott classics.\r\n</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	617	2011-03-26
618	1	20	\N	Taken	<p>\r\nEvery so often out of nowhere a surprise movie pops up and this can be both good and bad. Amid the hype of recent blockbusters, the movie <b>Taken</b> has slowly been moving towards its release date.\r\n</p><p>\r\nDirector Pierre Morel (District 13) and writer/producer Luc Besson (Arthur and the Invisibles) have quietly been making a vengeance flick starring... Liam Neeson (Seraphim Falls)? Neeson is a seriously heavy weight actor having starred in movies such as <i> 'Kingdom of Heaven'</i>, <i> 'The Mission'</i> and <i> 'Michael Collins'</i>, but has also appeared in popcorn movies like 'Batman Begins' and 'Love Actually'. Still it is a surprise to see him in a fairly clich vengeance movie.\r\n</p><p>\r\nNeeson stars as Bryan, an obsessive ex-government agent who is trying too late to reconnect with his teenage daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace - The Jane Austen Book Club). Shortly after her birthday Kim and a friend head off on a holiday to Paris. No sooner do they arrive and they are abducted but not before Kim has a tearful frightened conversation with her dad.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSo the thin well trodden path is laid before us. Bryan, the vengeful father, heads off to Paris to rescue his daughter and kill those who kidnapped her. His journey is swift, violent and merciless. There aren't any real hidden subplots or metaphors here; this is just a direct brutal action movie.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAs a brainless action movie this film hits the spot better than one of Neeson's many well placed punches. The film also has a sense of style and frenetic activity similar to the 'Bourne' movies, if not so refined or subtle. Do you detect a 'but' coming? This movie has lots of good ingredients but somehow doesn't stand out as a great. \r\n</p><p>\r\nI think one fault is the utter lack of characterisation. We only meet the daughter for a few moments before she is abducted so we don't really connect with her, meanwhile Bryan is a cold killing machine with one objective so there isn't much to warm to there either. The lack of any real subplot means you just watch the carnage unfold with little or no suspense.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOther critics have made a big thing about how this movie stumbles from one racial stereotype to another (sleazy French men, crooked Albanians, greedy Arab Sheiks and dizzy American teenagers) and basically warns Americans never to leave their country for fear of the evil foreigners. As this film was written, directed, and produced by Europeans that would suggest they are all either playing to the American crowd for the money or maybe hatching a genius plot to rid our historic cities of annoying tourists, either way the criticism seems a bit harsh, if well founded. \r\n</p><p>\r\nFor fans of relentless vendetta movies such as <i>'The Bourne Ultimatum'</i>, <i> 'Man on Fire'</i> or <i> 'Get Carter'</i>, this film is a thin but fun treat. However if you were hoping for something special from the creative team behind 'Leon' and the actor of <i> 'Rob Roy'</i> and <i> 'Schindler's List'</i>, you may feel a bit let down.\r\n</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	618	2011-03-26
619	1	20	\N	How to Lose Friends and Alienate People	<p>\r\nHow far would you go to get up close to a celebrity and maybe even bed them? Is it "stalking" to drive your career into the world of high society so you may mingle with the megastars? <i> 'How to Lose Friends and Alienate People'</i>, based on the book of the same name, attacks these questions while also telling a pleasant romance story.\r\n</p><p>\r\nVery similar to <i> 'The Devil Wears Prada'</i>, a struggling journalist finally lands a job in a prestigious New York magazine. Once again all employees are excessively thin and perfect and the boss is a bit evil. The difference being instead of a sassy hippy chick as our central character we have a sarcastic over confident Londoner. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe similarities don't end there. Our hero also begins with a strong idea of right and wrong which slowly begins to break down as ambition for success overtakes morality, and the path to true love often runs contrary to the career path.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThankfully, despite all the similarities, there is enough that is different to set this film apart. First off the hero, Sidney Young (Simon Pegg - Run Fatboy Run), is a Brit with a very different sense of humour. This sense of humour spills over into every other aspect of the movie and gives it a completely different 'feel'. Also, in acknowledging this importance in the leading man makes you realise the strength of Pegg's performance. Although Sidney is very similar to some of Pegg's earlier characters, he has enough physical comedy and verbal delivery to carry this movie.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSet against the lead we have the two love interests, Megan Fox (Transformers) as the sexy starlet and Kirsten Dunst (Spider-Man 3) as the career driven colleague. Megan, for her visible charms, is barely in the movie so despite being very easy on the eye she offers little to the movie effectively becoming the film's McGuffin. Dunst , on the other hand, is more crucial to the plot and has moments of brilliance hidden in yet another sidekick career girl performance. Hints at the energy we saw on <i>'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'</i> hidden by slow character development.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAll things considered this is a fun film that delivers exactly what you expect, plus a few moments of comedy brilliance but not enough to earn it that third star.  \r\n</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	619	2011-03-26
620	1	20	\N	The Mutant Chronicles	<p>\r\nA good idea wasted; there are a lot of things wrong with this movie. Sticking with the positive the story has some good ideas. Based on a role playing game that expanded into comics and novels, the story is set in a future dystopia where countries have faded to be replaced by mega-corporations that war for the world's dwindling resources. During one such bloody skirmish the warring sides accidentally crack an ancient stone seal and awaken an evil machine.\r\n</p><P>\r\nThe machine converts people into hyper violent and relentless mutants and the fragmented remnants of humanity do not have the muscle to stop this new enemy. Stepping up to the challenge is a mysterious priest from a remote monastery that has guarded the secrets of the evil machine for hundreds of years. The priest, Brother Samuel (Ron Perlman - Hellboy 2), gets approval from a doomed mega-corporation president to lead a small group of soldiers into the heart of the machine and destroy it once and for all.\r\nSo you can sort of guess the rest, the small band of fearless soldiers get picked off one by one as they slowly make their way to the movie's climax. \r\n</p><P>\r\nYou would like to think that a story with elements such as a shattered future earth, a massive subterranean mutant making machine, an army of zombie-like mutants, should be a sure fire hit. The movie has a good deal of visual flair ranging from the WW1-style trench battle at the beginning and the remote monastery but all this is wasted. \r\nThe good elements of the story are skimmed over to try and engage the audience with action elements that don't actually deliver. The stylisation often veers to excess leaving any good elements lost in an over abundance of scenery. Then to hammer another nail in the coffin, the story has more holes in it than one of the numerous bullet strewn corpses that litter the movie.\r\n</p><P>\r\nThe action takes so long to get going that when it does the movie has to deliver something astounding to win redemption. Unfortunately it doesn't deliver, the action wasn't original and the few set pieces were set too far apart. Add to this the lack of any substantial characters this film just doesn't connect. An attempt to give each soldier a niche personality fell flat as there were too many people and by the time we meet the motley crew they were lined up for the slaughter. The only characters given a bit of depth are Brother Samuel, as the clich wise leader and the resigned Mitch (Thomas Jane - The Punisher), who looks like he has walked straight off <i>The Punisher</i> set into this failed flick.\r\n</p><P>\r\nUltimately this was a good idea for a science fiction action movie that could have spawned a franchise but with naff action and no real characters this movie crashes. It is an action movie as emaciated and hopeless as the future world it portrays.\r\n</p>	1	2011-03-26	620	2011-03-26
621	1	20	\N	Eagle Eye	<p>Technophobia returns to the big screen in the form of 'Eagle Eye'. A science fiction action thriller where "Big Brother" goes berserk and two everyday people find themselves embroiled in a fast paced terrorism plot. </p><p>\r\nRealistic IT and the movies rarely collide well. The reality is machines are only ever as good as the people who programme them and rarely chirp as you type or talk in a sexy voice. If they do talk it is normally to tell you about a great new upgrade you can buy or to bitch about limited resources or syntax errors. </p><p>\r\nThankfully 'Eagle Eye' suspends reality like so many movies before it and focuses instead on a few technology concepts that are at the current fringes of possibility and paranoia and before these get too techy or implausible, throws in tonnes of action to distract you. </p><p>\r\nJerry Shaw (Shia LaBeouf -Indiana Jones 4) is the 'second son' lost in the shadow of his far brighter and more successful patriotic twin brother. When said brother gets squished in a road accident Jerry suddenly finds his life turned upside down by an all knowing all powerful someone. He starts receiving calls from a woman who has filled his flat with weapons and explosives, filled his bank with tonnes of money, framing him as a terrorist. The woman assures him coldly that unless he follows her strict instructions, he'll end up in jail. </p><p>\r\nMeanwhile a professional single mum Rachel (Michelle Monaghan - Made of Honour) packs her son onto a train for a school trip so he can play trumpet at a concert. No sooner has she ordered a martini with her friends does she get a call from the same malevolent woman's voice. The woman on the phone threatens to harm Rachel's son if she doesn't follow her strict instructions. </p><p>\r\nThese two pawns are drawn together to carry out a series of jobs all the while under the scrutiny of the all seeing and seemingly omnipotent woman on the phone. The mysterious woman can control traffic lights, trains, random people's mobile phones, military equipment and of course, the ever evil Sat Nav. </p><p>\r\nHot on the trail of these two star crossed gimps are the ever beautiful Rosario Dawson (Death Proof) as an air force investigator curious about the death of Jerry's brother, and the ever relentless Billy Bob Thornton (Mr Woodcock), as a the FBI's chief terrorist catcher convinced of Jerry's guilt. </p><p>\r\nSadly, despite the good setup, this film's storyline doesn't offer much originality to a genre that has huge potential. The film is crammed with action to keep your attention distracted from the numerous plot holes that litter the movie. Pawn1 tries hard and does surpass his earlier efforts thanks to one or two scenes that help flesh out his character.  Pawn2 also does well considering the story kinda overlooks her character and her whole purpose in the plot, revealed later on, is a bit pathetic. </p><p> \r\nTurning to the action, this is where the movie does finally impress. A great deal of time must of have been spent conceiving the action sequences that litter the movie. While some are a bit naff (too many poor quality car chases), some are really good (the deranged car crushers), and these raise the average. Also some of the set pieces and plot devices are well conceived and put across well. </p><p>\r\nWeighing up these elements and looking back over the movie I'm afraid I can't give it more than two stars. It didn't surpass expectation at all and the plot holes and sense of dj vu left this film feeling a bit flat.</p><p>\r\nImagine the technology and plausibility of <i> 'Stealth'<i>, mixed with the healthy paranoia of <i> 'Enemy of the State'<i>, add a dash of technological superiority circa <i> '2001: A Space Odyssey'<i>, then subtract originality and you'll get the measure of this movie.  It has loads of style but little substance. </p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	621	2011-03-26
623	1	20	\N	Quantum of Solace	<p>\r\nThe latest greatest Bond movie has arrived but this time round 007 has a challenge even greater than a room full of henchmen to overcome, the audience expectation.\r\n<i>Casino Royale</i> delivered one of the best Bond movies of the entire franchise. What made the movie so successful can be debated for hours but I think one important component was the new Bond, Daniel Craig (The Golden Compass). The public was unsure that a blond hulking Bond could work and so they were overwhelmed not only by Craig's cold charm but also a genuinely great movie. \r\n</p><p>\r\nGone were the gadgets, gizmo's and plans for world domination to be replaced with something far more real and visceral. A cold calculated assassin hired to stitch up one crook over a game of cards and it thrilled. \r\n</p><p>So, two years later Craig returns and picks up right where he left off at the end of Casino Royale. He has captured Mr White and is racing through Italy to a hideout where he can hopefully extract information from the villain and find vengeance for the death of Vesper, Bond's deceased lover. \r\n</p><p>After a brief interrogation it is revealed that Mr White is part of a much larger network of criminals that permeate the intelligence community and manipulate it to their own ends. Big words from a man tied to a chair but in seconds the room is turned upside down by the surprise betrayal of one of M's (Judi Dench - Notes on a Scandal) own bodyguards.\r\n</p><p>A quick fruitless and frantic roof top chase sequence leads to a dead end and so Bond returns to London with M to try and unravel the truth. The only clue is a dubious financial record leading to Haiti. \r\n</p><p>So begins a fast paced action packed Bond movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. As Bond chases thin clues and thinner women across the globe, M tries to unravel the politics behind the mysterious organisation that hired Mr White. Bond wants revenge for Vesper, and the best way to find it is to bring down the whole show. \r\n</p><p>This is a great Bond movie. Many critics have shredded it in the press simply because it isn't <i>Casino Royale</i>. That movie could boast greater character development and a multi layered plot whereas, in comparison, <i><b>Quantum of Solace</i></b> is a straight forward chase movie. To that I just say, "So what, it's a great chase movie".\r\n</p><p>Craig's Bond, well established in Casino Royale, now gets to flex his muscles and kick ass all over the world. So what if the story isn't that deep or if the chief villain of the episode is a bulging eyed little French man with bad taste in clothing. The movie is fun, thrilling, and that is what counts. It is also a rather tidy set up for what could be a great next instalment as Bond and M may have a tricky time with a certain highly influential crook within their own government.  Roll on Bond 23!\r\n</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	623	2011-03-26
764	1	18	\N	The A-Team	</p>\r\nAs a keen fan of the TV series The A-Team, I used to be glued to the TV screen with my younger brother, mesmerised by BA Baracus and his mean machine, The A-Team van!\r\n</p>\r\nSuffice to say, the 2010 movie version of the hit TV series also had me hooked and glued to the big screen. Hooray, a successful remake!\r\n</p>\r\nThe movie follows the initial stages of creating The A-Team with a great insight into each character and the specialisms that they bring to the fray.\r\n</p>\r\nWe first meet mastermind Colonel Hannibal Smith (Liam Neeson - Taken) and sidekick Faceman (Bradley Cooper - Valentines Day) who are on an operation in Mexico. Along the way, they pick up BA (Quinton 'Rampage' Jackson - Death Warrior) and aptly named Howling Mad Murdock (Sharlto Copley - District 9) and there you have our quartet of mercenaries for hire.\r\n</p>\r\nEight years on and the boys are on a mission in Iraq. A shady CIA agent Lynch (Patrick Wilson - Watchmen) persuades them to take on a risky mission despite Army Intelligence Captain Charissa Sosa (Jessica Biel - Valentines Day) ordering them to avoid it at all costs.\r\n</p>\r\nAs the story normally goes, when someone tells you not to do something and you still go ahead you know there will be consequences! Despite their best efforts, The A-Team gets double-crossed and has to fight to clear their names.\r\n</p>\r\nWith an all star cast, it was always set to be a recipe for success! The A-Team boys worked superbly well together and the chemistry was fantastic. Neeson played the fatherly/leadership figure well coupled with Cooper's cheeky and witty persona. Jackson and Copley were hilarious, the banter between the two of them was both believable and endearing. Copley was especially impressive, following his memorable performance in District 9, putting on a convincing American accent and scarily believable unstable act.\r\n</p>\r\nThe A-Team had the perfect mix of action, humour and totty. Roll on the sequel! Fans of <i>The Expendables</i> and <i>Die Hard</i> movies are sure to love this action-fest!\r\n</p>	4	2011-03-26	764	2011-03-26
763	1	16	Blah	The Switch	<p><i>The Switch</i> is an offbeat comedy starring Jason Bateman (Arrested Development, Juno, Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Hancock) and Jennifer Aniston (The Bounty Hunter, The Break Up, Marley and Me).  Shot entirely in New York, the story centres around Kassie, a singleton in her early forties who is ready to embrace motherhood.  Much to the disappointment of her best friend Wally she decides to find a sperm donor rather than..."wait around for something that may never happen"!  </p>\r\nSoon after her announcement, Kassie is thrown an 'insemination party' by her friend Debbie (Juliette Lewis - Catch and Release) where the chosen donor, a handsome Viking-esque Roland (Patrick Wilson - The A-Team) is at hand to provide his sperm.  However, in a drunken stupor, Wally finds the sperm donation jar while in the bathroom and makes a 'switch' replacing the sperm with his own, before passing out and blanking out the incident.</p>  \r\nSeven years later, Kassie returns to New York with her young son Sebastian (Thomas Robinson).   From the moment Wally meets the young boy the similarities are obvious and he is forced to realise the full extent of the drunken 'switch' and face up to his responsibilities.</p>  \r\nOverall, I was disappointed with this film.  There is a lack of chemistry between the two main characters and even their strong friendship is far from convincing.  There is very little nostalgia even when they reunite after seven years apart and aside from Kassie moving away, Wally has not changed or moved on in anyway.  There is a lack of dynamism in their lives despite the seven year time gap. The promise of amusing anecdotes and irony surrounding relationships does not come through and the quips and amusements are provided mainly by the supporting roles of Debbie and Leonard (played by Lewis and Jeff Goldblum respectively).  </p>   \r\nBy far the best actor is young Robinson who confidently walks a fine line between neuroticism and childhood innocence.  His relationship and affinity for Wally is the most convincing and the one relationship which seems to contain the most substance.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the mother-son relationship.  Kassie lacks a maternal instinct despite being a single mother for the past seven years and her ability to handle her son's unusual quirks with nonchalance makes her character more annoying and irritable rather than elicit a natural parenting connection.   </p>\r\nDespite this, a redeeming aspect of the film is the authenticity it lends to life in New York.  Using a wide variety of scene locations from Queens and Midtown Manhattan through to Central Park, the film does successfully provide an insight into lives of New Yorkers as they go about their daily business in the city that never sleeps.  </p>\r\nThere are some moments of humour but unfortunately they are not enough to sustain the whole film and the storyline was too predictable to sustain my interest.  This is easy viewing but not worth a trip to the cinema for. This movie would probably appeal to fans of <i>Knocked Up </i>and <i>Three Men and a Baby</i>. </p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	763	2012-03-08

636	1	18	\N	What Just Happened	<p>\r\n<b>What Just Happened</b> is a wry comedy based on the best selling memoirs of Hollywood producer Art Linson. Directed by Barry Levinson, (Rain Man and Bugsy), Linson also wrote the screenplay and produced the film alongside Robert De Niro and Jane Rosenthal. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDe Niro (Righteous Kill) plays the lead role of Ben, the Hollywood producer, and the movie follows two roller coaster weeks in his life as he struggles to cope with the drama in his professional and personal life. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nAs a producer, he has to deal with the difficult actor Bruce Willis (played as himself - Planet Terror), the passionate director Jeremy (Michael Wincott - Seraphim Falls) traumatised by the demand to compromise his artistic integrity, quirky agent Dick (John Turturro - Margot at the Wedding) who is scared of his own clients and the ball busting studio chief Lou (Catherine Keener - Into the Wild) who writes off the impending release 'Fiercely' as a flop and is determined to cut her losses. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nAdded to this stress, Ben is also trying to deal with the demands of his personal life, seeing his children from two failed marriages while trying to salvage his relationship with his ex wife Kelly (Robin Wright Penn - Beowulf) by ironically attending therapy sessions designed to help them live a healthy life apart. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nAs the producer of Hollywood classics such as 'The Untouchables' and 'Fight Club' Linson's memoirs add credibility to the outrageous demands and ego trips of Hollywood life. Indeed the drama within the drama is captured perfectly by Willis as he throws a petulant tantrum refusing to shave his hairy beard for the sake of the film. The scene is played with such melodrama showing how Hollywood A-listers can ultimately influence the success of a film. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nAlongside Willis, the director Jeremy (played by Wincott) is also very successful in showing the high drama of Hollywood. With a British rock star persona already teetering on the brink of insanity he is pushed over the edge as he is ordered to alter the end of his film. Wincott's portrayal of the highly-strung director is excellent and his inner strength really does shine through as the film progresses. Indeed, his character is the only one that successfully challenges the hypocrisy of the industry. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nAnother strength of the film was the fantastic cinematography by Stephane Fontaine used to great effect to convey the fast pace of the action while mirroring the myriad of emotions and constant hypertension of Ben's life. In a disjointed but effective contrast, the classical soothing tones of Nina Simone and the soundtrack of the new film 'Fiercely' played in the car help to reflect the need for tranquillity in a very hectic lifestyle. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nDe Niro again delivers a fine performance. He effortlessly portrays the tragic and subtle comedy of the successful producer trying desperately to manage his career and salvage his personal life. The film shows that, despite his success, he is still just human and trying to cope with that delicate balance of career and family, the clich of just being like everyone else in the world. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nWith such an all-star cast this film fell well below expectations. The comedy was lacking and had only glimpses of dark humour, which at best made me smile. While providing an interesting insight into the drama of Hollywood producers, the film lacked any real story line and also lacked inspiration. Indeed I left feeling that the only answer to 'What just happened??' was actually 'Not very much?'.\r\n</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	636	2011-03-26
638	1	23	\N	Blindness	\r\n</p>\r\nHumanity pushed to extremes is clearly a subject that strikes a cord with Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles. His smoking gun-barrel hot debut <i>City of God</i> showed the violence of his home county's ghettos. His sophomore effort <i>The Constant Gardner</i> depicted the hell-on-earth of western exploitation of Africa. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThird film <b>Blindness</b> is a bold choice -- despite exploring similar themes to his first two -- because it sees the director move outside of depicting the real world and into a post-apocalyptic vision of mankind destroying itself. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThis ballsy decision to film Nobel Prize winning Spanish novelist Jose Saramago's supposedly un-filmable book, in which a plague of unexplained blindness sweeps the world, totally pays off with some of his best work yet. \r\n</p><p>\r\nBlindness is a raw, harsh film that has the power to unsettle, nauseate as well as uplift. It portrays people doing unspeakable things to each other as those in the (almost) sightless society degenerate to their basic impulses, lead by Gael Garcia Bernal's (Babel) misanthropic barman who makes himself king of the hospital where the blind are confined. \r\n</p><p>\r\nBut it also shows blindness does turn everyone into mere animals who only desire food, sex or pointless wealth. \r\n</p><p>\r\nJulianne Moore (I'm Not There) gives an incredible performance as the only person who does not go blind, but pretends she has in order to stay with her doctor husband (Mark Ruffalo - Zodiac) who loses his sight. \r\n</p><p>\r\nShe starts by merely thinking of her husband, but soon becomes the eyes for everyone in the ward, literally leading her group through the horrors that remain unseen for them. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe acting from the cast of non-blind actors (a fact that has drawn much criticism from blind rights groups) is truly exceptional. With lesser performances and another director Blindness could have been a disaster. In the hands of the scarily talented Meirelles and his international cast, it's a tour de force.\r\n</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	638	2011-03-26
639	1	20	\N	Zack and Miri Make a Porno	<p>\r\nAfter appearing in a few movies and taking a break from directing, Kevin Smith returns to the writing desk and a delivers a fun new comedy.   The title sort of gives away the plot but for those who need it explaining....\r\n</p><p>\r\nSet in a small frozen town somewhere in North America the story focuses on two school friends, now in their late twenties, who have never really achieved much. Zack (Seth Rogan - Pineapple Express) is a fat disgruntled coffee shop clerk and Miri (Elizabeth Banks - Definitely Maybe) , a beautiful girl in a similar dead end job. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAt a hilarious visit to a school reunion Miri tries to seduce the former football captain, Bobby Long, blissfully unaware that he is gay. Zack knows this because he is chatting with the excessively gay porn star that is banging the football champ in ways we don't want to imagine.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter the utility companies close off the water and electric at their house, Zack and Miri need to find some cash and in desperation they strike upon a plan. Inspired by Bobby Long and his adult entertainment antics, Zack and Miri... you guessed it... they decide to make a porno. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIt doesn't take long for imaginative slacker Zack to come up with a script and soon they are pulling together a crew of miscreants and hookers who will help them make their movie. Among these is Zack's unhappily married friend Delaney (Craig Robinson - Pineapple Express), the stoned boner Lester (Jason Mewes - Clerks 2) and Bubbles (Traci Lords - a real former adult entertainer) whose name is a hint of what she can do with her lady bits.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAs you can imagine, filming a skin flick isn't as easy as any of them think. The film explores loads of funny situations as Zack and Miri stumble from disaster to disaster such as finding sets, finding a camera, and managing to keep emotionally detached from the sex.\r\n</p><p>\r\nCrammed with Kevin Smith's patent dialogue the film will be a hit with his fans.<p>\r\n<i>"I'm a guy. You give me a two popsicle sticks and a rubber band and I'll find a way to f**k it like a filthy MacGyver!"</i></p>\r\nAt the core of the comedy is a nice romance story that manages to give the plot a purpose without diluting the jokes. Similar to 'Clerks 2' in its tone, this is good dirty fun.\r\n</p><p>\r\nElizabeth Banks is delightful as Miri and has good chemistry with the far less attractive Seth Rogan who looks like he stumbled in from his last flick Pineapple Express. Rogan delivers another funny performance as a slacker and is still on good form but I worry that too many more roles like this and he'll become bland. Special mention should be made for Craig Robinson as Delaney. His wisecrack comments steal scenes from his co-stars and his delivery is great. Also keep an eye out for the camp cameo coupling of Brandon Routh (Superman Returns) and an exceptionally funny Justin Long (Die Hard 4).</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	639	2011-03-26
640	1	20	\N	Madagascar 2 - Escape to Africa	<p>Alex is a self assured lion, happy with his life as the star attraction of Central Park Zoo, wowing his crowd of adoring fans. His friend Marty, a zebra, is less than content. He is ten years old and has never seen anything beyond the zoo and dreams of adventure. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>One evening after a chance encounter with some militant penguins digging under the wall, Marty decides it's time to explore the world and sets off through New York. Fearing for the safety of his friend, Alex, along with a sexy hippo named Gloria and a hypochondriac giraffe named Melman, sets off to rescue his friend. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you may imagine, the presence of a zebra, lion, giraffe and hippo on the streets of New York is a serious concern for the human population and the animals' night on the town is mistaken as a plea for freedom so the zoo keepers sedate the animals and ship them off for release into the wild.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a fracas aboard their ship and a course correction perpetrated by an ice crazed penguin, the four heroes find themselves falling over board into the ocean and eventually washed up on an uninhabited shore. They have arrived in Madagascar. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rest of the movie follows the adventures as the four domesticated animals try to fend for themselves and adjust to life in the wild all the while being annoyed by a community of partying lemurs. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a kids film full of talking animals there is some great comedy here to keep the adult audience happy. The computer animation is on top form adding some fresh ingredients to what is becoming an established genre and the movie is packed with popcorn references. Keep any eye out for references to Zoolander, American Beauty, Castaway, Lion King and many more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Providing the vocals for this madcap treat, Ben Stiller (Meet the Fockers) as Alex, Chris Rock (Head of State) as Marty, Jada Pinkett Smith (Collateral) as Gloria and David Schwimmer (Friends [TV]) as Melman, are all equally great. The star of the movie for me though was Sacha Baron Cohen (commonly known as Ali G) as Julien, King of the Lemurs. Dancing and shaking his stuff while manipulating the marooned zoo animals, Julien is hilarious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Madagascar is from the creators of Shrek and Shark Tale. Shrek was a five star classic while a similar format was starting to feel stale by the time Shark Tale was released. Luckily Madagascar offers something fresh and this raises it above some of its competitors. It's a good laugh with some great animation and adventure. It can also boast a subtle message regarding the effect of captivity on animals. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you like the comedy of Ben Stiller and Chris Rock or other animated features such as Robots, Shrek or The Incredibles, then I think you'll enjoy this movie.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	640	2011-03-26
648	1	4	\N	Sex Drive	<p>\r\nSex Drive follows three teenage friends as they venture on a road trip of a lifetime. \r\n</p><p>\r\nEighteen year old Ian (Josh Zuckerman - Lions for Lambs) is a nice guy but is a bit of a loser in life. As it's his last summer before college, Ian, who is taunted by his 14-year old, cocksure younger brother, and his older brother, cocky jock Rex (James Marsden - Enchanted), wants to lose his virginity before starting a new term.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nWith his devil-may-care mate Lance (Clark Duke - Geek [TV]) in tow, and long-term "best-friend" Felicia (Amanda Crew - John Tucker Must Die), Ian attempts to hook up with a woman he has met online, who has promised him entertainment in the bedroom department if he makes the eight-hour drive across the country to see her. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThinking with parts other than his brain, Ian and his friends embark on a three-day marathon of mayhem, including car trouble, a detour to an Amish farm, a stint in jail, and other humorous calamities set to derail his initial plans. These mishaps all started when Ian thought it would be a great idea to borrow / steal his big brother's prized car to make the trip. Inevitably the road trip, of course, ends up being a trip of self discovery.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nAs a side comment - it was interesting to see Marsden, who normally plays romantic heartthrobs, as a complete jerk, but a lovable one at that, and it was refreshing to see the main lead guy, who is a perpetual loser / virgin to actually be quite cute, whereas his best friend Lance, not what you'd call classically handsome, was the one that got all the ladieees. It's all about the confidence!!!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThis was a thoroughly enjoyable film - me and my friend giggled the whole way through. But like any rom-com, there has to be the obligatory slower, more serious moments three-quarters of the way through so that the romantic side of the story can touch our hearts - otherwise it was funny all the way to the end.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nAlthough playing a side story character, Seth Green (Family Guy [TV]) was brilliant as Ezekiel, a sarcastic Amish guy who, having strayed a little too far from the farm in his youth gaining worldly wisdom, prefers to play up to people's underestimation of him.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nA number of easily recognised cameos made their entry over the course of this road trip, such as Dave Koechner (Semi Pro) who played a hitchhiker, Kyle Gass (Kung Fu Panda) who played a hilarious trucker, and Brian Posehn (Surf's Up) who played a gypsy who has a sparring match with Ian and Lance. Fantastic!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThe best way to sum up this film is to imagine that American Pie had a love child with Road Trip, and spawned this fantastic baby.\r\n</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	648	2011-03-26
661	1	20	\N	Watchmen	<p>\r\nWe all love a good superhero movie; the action, the adventure, the high horse morality. We happily accept a hero with some form of special ability, a dark secret that drives them to save the innocent and the equally powerful villain with a dastardly plan. But if you stop to think about it, what would you really think of a chap in spandex who goes out at night fighting crime; a maniac, a fool, or maybe an escaped psychiatric patient?\r\n</p><p>\r\nSet in an alternative 1980's where Richard Nixon is still president of the USA and the cold war is a very real threat, our heroes start to suspect dark forces at work behind the scenes when one of their group, The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan - The Accidental Husband) is brutally murdered. While the world doesn't miss the aging immoral soldier, one "hero", a masked psychopath named Rosarach (Jackie Earle-Haley - SemiPro), suspects this to be the first clue to something sinister.\r\n</p><p>\r\nRosarach is a nasty piece of work, as is 'The Comedian', and as he visits former heroes to alert them to his suspicions we realise that all these heroes are slightly messed up, a reflection of the world they live in. There is a super intelligent slightly camp business man (Matthew Goode - Brideshead Revisited), a shy reclusive inventor(Patrick Wilson - Lakeview Terrace) who is suffering from impotence following his retirement from crime fighting, a former heroine (Malin Akerman - 27 Dresses) who is now employed by the military to look after her boyfriend and finally a god, a former nuclear physicist who gained the ability to control all matter in the universe during an accident.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThis final character in the menagerie, Doc Manhattan (Billy Crudup - The Good Shepherd), is the movie's highlight and much of the story revolves around the consequences of his existence. With a god in his back pocket, Nixon relies heavily on Doc Manhattan to help prevent a war but the opposite seems to be happening. The Russians look more than happy to die fighting rather than on their knees.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAlready you should be sensing that this film isn't your conventional superhero flick. It is dark and disturbing, the violence is graphic and the characters are flawed, some seriously unsound. The story doesn't follow one path and is more like a montage as we see snippets from each character's past and the various nasty things happening in the present that bring this eclectic gang back together. You could say the main thrust of the story is the manipulation of Doc Manhattan, or you could just as easily say it's the realisation that the American Dream is actually a nightmare. Each story has an angle and they're all a little unsettling.\r\n</p><p>\r\nDespite an excellent story we now reach the crisis, there is loads of dialogue and very little happening. Expectations for loads of action, big explosions and bizarre villains are left unfed. The affect is that the brilliant story, diluted and warped from the original book, feels slow and, for many, tedious. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDirector Zack Snyder (300) has tried very hard to remain faithful to the source material and should be commended for his efforts. He has changed the ending slightly and on reflection you can see why, even though the original had its charms. The acting is universally good and the visual impact of the movie is spot on, yet it doesn't fully satisfy. There are some action scenes and these are very good and very violent, however they are few and far between resulting in what feels like a very long film. Also I have an issue with the ending but more on that later.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn summary, if you enjoy multi threaded stories with dark twisted characters that slowly culminate in an evil plan then you'll love this film. If you're looking for lots of whoop ass action sequences then you're probably gonna be disappointed. Scroll down to read why I don't like the ending (warning - spoilers).\r\n</p><p>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the book this final horrific attack is realised by page upon page of pictures of twisted dead bodies that really punches home how truly evil the plan was. Although something equally sinister happens in the movie, they don't have the dead bodies, instead people get vaporised. An odd kind of wimping out considering the graphic and bloody violence in the earlier scenes. The consequence is that you don't feel the real horror of what has happened and some of the brilliance of the story is lost in this one simple point. You should leave the story feeling conflicted about who was right, instead you're left feeling a little...ho-hum</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	661	2011-03-26
664	1	1	\N	Outlander	<p>\r\n\r\nAnd so it begins. Norway 709AD. Gruff dirty humans in undeveloped societies fighting local wars with other tribes, eating meat and drinking mead. But hark, a spaceship crash lands in to a lake and a crisp, tanned and gym-fresh young man (not the hairy, drunken, smelly Adonis from 709) floats out of the ship as the only survivor we see. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe man from another planet is called Kanan (NOT Conan) and luckily his laptop not only turns on, it works, scans the local environment and injects all the information he might need in the blink of an eye. Of course. Unsurprisingly, Kanan wasn't the only survivor, a Moorwen, a dragon-like monster (that glows and, um, growls) had also managed to escape the wreck of the spaceship and had travelled inland ahead of Kanan to cause a suitable amount of carnage and gore. There we have the crux of the story? </p><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nKanan is the only person who really understands the Moorwen and he must lead the local men in trying to destroy the monster. This film gives you everything you might expect once you've taken in the above and still wish to go and see it. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe cast are certainly enthusiastic and try their best but ultimately a ridiculous storyline coupled with some shambolic scripting makes this film a little tiresome. Although there are some choice moments - a young boy called Eric certainly got attention whenever he was on screen and some humorous scenes, many showing the relationship between Kanan and Eric maturing. The humour might well not have been intentional, but it was funny all the same. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nOn to the monster. Actually, the monster wasn't bad at all, if very reminiscent of <i>Alien</i>. He (or she, or it) has time to find quite a substantial lair and the scenes within it are pretty decent. There are some issues with how large this thing is, and different scenes will suggest different things, but suspension of belief is something you will really need for this film anyway. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe only female character that is developed in any way is a strong one, although it looks like Kate Winslet wasn't free so they got her body double in. She is very much a stereotypical only daughter of a king who has learnt how to fight with a sword and wants to do everything the boys do. Predictably she falls for Kanan early on, but is unwilling to admit it. We'll see how long that lasts. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nSo on the whole predictable, although totally unbelievable storyline, good(ish) monster and a mix of acting skills. If you adore sci-fi films set in Norway, or like to let yourself go and just enjoy a hammed up monster romp then go see it. Otherwise, probably give it a miss.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	664	2011-03-26
665	1	20	\N	Monsters Vs Aliens	<p>\r\n<b>Monsters</b> is an alien invasion film with a unique approach, considering the aliens themselves rarely feature. Director and writer Gareth Edwards, in his feature film debut, has created a surprisingly effective blend of innovative alien-incursion tropes, political themes and endearing relationship drama. It is to his considerable credit that he has managed to do so on a shoestring budget compared to other more 'Hollywood' films of this type. \r\n</p>\r\nPhoto journalist Andrew Caulder (Scoot McNairy) finds himself in the unenviable position of having to escort his boss' daughter Samantha Wynden (Whitney Able) across an infected zone filled with alien life forms that crash-landed on earth six years prior to the story's opening. At first downright indignant, Caulder soon warms to his task, and it quickly becomes evident that this is much more of a love story than your typical alien movie. Using relatively unknown actors works in the film's favour, and Edwards' technique of providing just the gist of what he wanted in each scene before allowing his cast to improvise the finer details makes for some highly impressive performances from the main duo. \r\n</p>\r\nIndeed, it is easy to forget that there are nasty aliens lurking out there, such is the level of emotional investment the audience soon begins to feel for Caulder and Wynden. Both characters have to bear the burden of troubling issues in their lives which are kept at bay by their incursion into the infected zone, and their aversion to having to go back to normality highlights the growing affection they have for each other as the story progresses. In fact, we only see glimpses of the beastly aliens during the last scene in the film, when Edwards confirms our suspicions that these invaders are not quite as fearsome as the authorities would have the citizens of Mexico and the US believe. Instead, they are portrayed as beautiful and even magical natural creations, wandering around a strange world they cannot hope to ever call home. \r\n</p>\r\nMonsters is an exceptionally impressive debut from Edwards, with fine acting from its two lead actors, some wonderful cinematography using the Mexican setting to great effect, and a young director flexing his muscles to create a new twist on the typical alien invasion story. It succeeds because Edwards is not afraid to be bold and inventive, thus elevating the film to a higher status than such Hollywood fare as <i>'War of the Worlds'</i>. \r\n</p>	4	2011-03-26	665	2011-03-26
667	1	4	\N	Il Divo	<p>\r\nThis Italian subtitled film is a biopic about Giulio Andreotti (Toni Servillo - Gomorro), the Italian Prime Minister who was elected to power seven times over four decades under a cloud of controversy. This calm, yet crafty, man was awake while the rest of Rome was asleep, working and writing his books while moving in the "right" circles, which he fitted around a schedule of going to church to pray.\r\n</p></p>\r\nEven though Andreotti wasn't arrogant, he showed little humility, with signs of a God complex. He was not afraid of anybody, helped by the fact that all he came into contact held him up in awe. He doesn't seem to be satisfied by anything, bar his own power which is what makes him tick.\r\n</p></p>\r\n\r\nHe seems to be a man whose association with all that is slightly dodgy around him, from his connection with the Mafia, to slanderous accusations, electoral battles and terrorist massacres, barely touch him. \r\n</p></p>\r\n\r\nSet against the backdrop of a grim and corrupt Italy, a number of seedy characters are introduced. Suspense was created through its score, while the director embellished all that was ugly. What was interesting was how the lead, who was an ugly character both on the inside and out, was also depicted to have a softer tangible side.\r\n</p></p>\r\n\r\nThis intensely political film has been quoted as being wildly inventive and witty and, although this film has won 2 film awards and been nominated for a total of 5 awards, I'm afraid it didn't really do it for me. I wasn't too sure if I was supposed to take this historical film seriously, for many different reasons, most notably the odd characters that looked like extras from British comedy "A League of Gentlemen" or "The Rocky Horror Show", and Andreotti looked like Lurch from the Addams family.  \r\n</p></p>\r\n\r\nI have to admit there were one or two amusing bits such as some old man who suddenly breaks out into dancing calypso at a party, but the piece to camera, although arty and probably worked well with the overall oddness of the film, didn't help to make the film particularly enjoyable for me. These Italian rants actually got so loud and too fast to follow that my ears and eyes hurt. I can see it becoming a bit of a cult classic among some, but personally for me, Il Divo is more of an Il Don'to...\r\n</p></p>\r\n\r\nIf you like <i>The Bankers of God</i> or <i>W</i>, then you might like this.\r\n</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	667	2011-03-26
670	1	1	\N	State of Play	<p>\r\n<b>State of Play</b> is a political thriller starring Ben Affleck (Smokin' Aces) and Russell Crowe (Body of Lies) as old college friends who become embroiled in a high level conspiracy. Affleck plays Congressman Stephen Collins who is high up in an un-named party. He is leading on an investigation in to a major arms company and is far from a popular man with the major players involved. The film begins with his mistress turning up dead and his affair very quickly coming to light. The papers, of course, have a field day. Cue Crowe, he plays an old timer journalist from the Washington Sun and is torn between getting a good story and supporting his friend (Could Affleck and Crowe every REALLY be friends?). Ultimately it seems, the story wins.\r\n</p><p>\r\nQuickly we become acquainted with the paper's office, where a lot of the plot unfolds. Fashioned on the press offices of the 1980s, Cal (Crowe) looks right at home and is resistent to influence and change from the new online team, a nice reference to the real threat of online content to print news and the changing shape of getting those scoops.  The new face of news reporting is where Rachel McAdams (The Lucky Ones) comes in. She plays bright eyed, bushy tailed online blogger Della Frye, and when she gets her fingers in to a story she won't let go. Although, you can't help but think Cal could have bullied it out of her if he had really wanted to. McAdams gives a nice performance, if a little too 'little girl lost' at times, a bit more balls wouldn't have gone amiss, especially against the extreme contrast of the exceptionally manly performance that Crowe throws in. You can almost smell his testosterone fuelled odour coming out of the projector. Helen Mirren (Inkheart) is also rather good, if a little cliched as a ball busting English editor, desperately battling to save her paper while having a soft spot for the ever deadline-missing Cal.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe production of the film was marred by cast changes, the two leads originally cast to Ed Norton and Brad Pitt. You can't help but think the film would have been somewhat different with the two original casting choices, the most incongruous issue with Affleck and Crowe is whether they could really have ever been college friends. Pitt and Norton, on the other hand, all the way.\r\n</p><p>\r\nUltimately this film was hugely enjoyable, a great cast, with Crowe back on form, a great pace and a good story, if you don't look too closely. There are a few moral questions raised when evidence that should be turned in to the police is kept by the newspaper. But then, maybe I'm missing the point. This is an excellent thriller with even some real sentiment included. One of the better films of the year... so far. </p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	670	2011-03-26

Jackman and Schreiber were certainly the saving grace of this film and a naked Jackman was more than enough reason to pull in a dedicated female audience into the cinemas.

672	1	20	\N	Star Trek	<p>In the Star Trek universe almost anything is possible and over dozens of TV series', spin offs and movies they had had pretty much exhausted the format. Or so we thought. The franchise had become bloated and like the crew of USS Voyager, lost in space.\r\n</p><p>Now, thankfully, the fun and energy that made the concept so great has been rediscovered thanks to a revamp. In recent years many tired franchises have been revived, some more successfully than others, and Star Trek is definitely one of the best I have seen.\r\n</p><p>The original series focused on the commander and crew of the USS Enterprise, a slick stylish spaceship, the flagship of Starfleet. In control is a very human, brash, brave and suave Captain Kirk who loves the ladies as much as kicking Klingon ass.

The odd friendship between these two  is complimented by a sarcastic ranting doctor 'Bones', a Russian navigator with a speech impediment (Chekov), a frustrated genius Scottish engineer (Scotty), a Chinese pilot (Sulu) and, lest we forget, super babe communications officer (Uhura).\r\n</p><p>This modern revamp tears apart the well understood relationships between these characters and begins back before they are born with a large evil machine appearing out of nowhere and blowing seven shades of sh#t out of a federation spaceship.

The soon to be born baby is our hero, Kirk, and this strange attack in space has altered the usual course of history.\r\n</p><p>Flash forward and we find Kirk as an undisciplined smart but reckless youth starting bar brawls and chatting up the ladies in dingy bars. After a fracas he catches the attention of Starfleet's admiral Pike who quickly convinces Kirk to enlist and follow in his father's footsteps.\r\n</p><p>Action is the main drive for this film followed closely by humour so the story quite quickly whizzes through Kirk's years at the Starfleet academy chucking in oodles of little in-jokes and introduces us to all the known and beloved characters. Before things get too pedestrian, an imminent attack on Vulcan ramps up the action and its all aboard the Enterprise for the second half of the movie which is almost non-stop action to the final scenes.\r\n</p><p>The 'altered path of history' story arc, often explored in Science Fiction, allows the films makers to legitimately re-forge the Star Trek universe in their own style without shattering too many treasured elements. There are some controversial changes but mostly they are accepted and the action sequences are very well put together.\r\n</p><p>The young good looking actors, relatively unknown, look and feel right in their roles and the chemistry is spot on. As an obvious 'first step in a new franchise' this is a great film comparable in its makeover success to <i>'Casino Royale'</i>. As with that great movie the sequel will have to travel light years to overtake the success of its parent but fingers crossed that endless universe of heroes and villains that is Star Trek will find something to keep us thrilled.\r\n</p><p>Hats off to all involved in this re-visioning, to drop names now would be pointless but I suppose special mention needs to be made of the lead actors, especially Chris Pine (Smokin' Aces) as Kirk who confidently takes the lead and also Zoe Saldana (Vantage Point) as Uhura who manages to add a new dimension to the saucy communications officer raising the character above mere eye candy status.</p>\r\n	5	2011-03-26	672	2011-03-26
674	1	20	\N	Angels & Demons	<p>Director Ron Howard and Tom Hanks reunite for another historically inventive thriller. Based on the Dan Brown prequel to The Da Vinci Code, the story centres on a murderous plot surrounding the election of a new pope and a potential terrorist attack on the Vatican itself.\r\n</p><p>A religious physicist uses the Hadron collider to create 'Anti-Matter', a highly dangerous and unstable substance. If Anti-Matter makes contact with conventional matter the two substances annihilate each other and emit a massive amount of energy akin to an atomic bomb. The existence of Anti-Matter, previously only theoretical, may hold the key to the creation of the universe. \r\n</p><p>Not content with making very dangerous micro particles of Anti-Matter, our misguided physicist makes a mass powerful enough to destroy a city. No sooner has he smiled upon his new creation when he is brutally murdered and the Anti-Matter stolen by someone with a dark plan.\r\n</p><p>Meanwhile our intellectual hero Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks - The Da Vinci Code) is summoned from his college swimming pool to the Vatican so he may help the Swiss Guard locate four kidnapped cardinals and avert a disaster. The Anti-Matter is hidden somewhere in the Vatican and another ancient secret society, which Langdon alone has some knowledge of, hopes to use it to destroy the heart of Catholicism.\r\n</p><p>Lucky then that the shadowy villains leave clues within their threat that may help Langdon not only perform the quickest history tour of Rome but hopefully save some of the cardinals and the papacy.\r\n</p><p>Chuck in a grieving, if pointless, female physicist with nice legs to help spice things up and infrequently tell us titbits about why Anti-Matter is so scary, and you should have a great action packed thriller. Sadly, you don't.\r\n</p><p>So far this sounds like gripping stuff, if fanciful, but it has issues. Anyone with half a mind may ask the obvious, "If you truly wanted to destroy the Vatican would you leave clues, albeit cryptic, that may unravel your dastardly plan?" This then leads logically to "Only if you wanted the plan to fail at the last moment and take credit for saving the day". Then even the kids can follow the final steps to point the finger at the badly hidden architect of this conspiracy.\r\n</p><p>Tom Hanks is on good form as Robert Langdon but even he cannot save the movie. Adding some more star power Ewan McGregor (Deception) adds energy as the acting head of the Vatican during conclave and Stellan Skarsgard (Mamma Mia) adds gravelling menace as the head of the Swiss Guard. Staying on the good points, the musical score was beautiful, as were the views of Rome. Sorry, that's about it for compliments. \r\n</p><p><i>The Da Vinci Code</i>, despite being slow, had some nice camera work with occasional dissolves to possible moments in history that are relevant to the plot. These intellectual diversions and discussions are replaced by attempted action sequences, possibly hoping to add energy to a lumbering plot. Unfortunately the action isn't that gripping. Similarly The Da Vinci Code boasted an unsettling villain in the form of murderous misguided albino monk Silas. The assassin in this movie is barely seen and gets little chance to threaten.  A real shame as his character was truly frightening in the book. \r\n</p><p>Fundamentally the book wasn't that good and the film sadly doesn't improve on things despite great performances from Hanks and some nice set pieces. Part of the problem is the many computer generated locations, the long running time, but mostly it is the underlying story. Good music though.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	674	2011-03-26
677	1	16	\N	Drag Me to Hell	<p><i>Spiderman</i> director Sam Raimi and brother Ivan Raimi have teamed up to deliver a 'jump-fest' horror that will send chills running through.\r\n</p><p>Cute bank loan officer Christine (Alison Lohman - Things We Lost in the Fire) is ambitious and has her eyes set on the assistant manager role at work. She is out to please her boss Mr Jacks (David Paymer - Ocean's 13) who is looking for someone who can be tough. \r\n</p><p>To prove her suitability for the role, Christine takes a hard stance with an old gypsy woman who is begging for another extension on her loan to avoid being thrown out of her own home. But when Christine refuses and shames the gypsy lady, she bestows an evil curse on her.\r\n</p><p>Christine, who has a lovely life with her boyfriend Clay (Justin Long - He's Just Not That Into You), sees her world turned upside down as strange events start happening around her. She seeks reassurance and insight from a fortune teller Rham Jas (Dileep Rao - Brothers & Sisters [TV]). He warns her that a dark spirit is surrounding her and she must follow a simple set of instructions to claim her freedom before the demon emerges to drag her kicking and screaming into the depths of hell.\r\n</p><p>Lohman puts in a good performance as the blonde victim who has to face her fears and battle a strong demon. Lorna Raver (Eli Stone [TV]) is suitably freaky as the old gypsy woman who pops up throughout the movie. Long plays the usual drippy boyfriend role.\r\n</p><p>Praise has to go to the brains behind this horror success, the Raimi brothers. Despite a simple plot, the constant action and jumpy sequences keep you on the edge of your seat and constantly worried about what will jump out of the screen next. I could envisage an even scarier 3D version of this movie! I certainly left the cinema feeling spooked out, which is what a good horror should achieve!\r\n</p><p>Fans of <i>My Bloody Valentine</i>, <i>The Ring</i>, and <i>The Grudge</i> will enjoy this movie. Be prepared to jump out of your seat!</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	677	2011-03-26
679	1	20	\N	Terminator Salvation	<p>The world is decimated and the remnants of humanity are being systematically hunted by the relentless machine army of SkyNet. In small groups around the world, pockets of humans cling together to form the resistance hoping to one day save mankind. Among them is John Connor (Christian Bale - The Dark Knight).\r\n</p><p>Cursed since before his birth with foreknowledge of the apocalypse and the emergence of the machines, John has grown to become a hero and source of inspiration for his fellow man. Tormented by the knowledge that the machines are winning and that the resistance leaders do not fully trust him, John faces a new challenge.\r\nAfter a disastrous attack on a SkyNet facility, John learns that the machines are targeting an unknown human, Kyle Reece, the man John alone knows will ultimately go back in time and father him. If Kyle is killed John will cease to exist and mankind will be doomed. \r\n</p><p>Meanwhile, a convicted killer from the nineties, Marcus  (Sam Worthington - Hart's War), killed for his crimes, awakes naked in this wrecked future. He wanders through the ruined streets of LA and by chance encounters a starving but brave teenager fighting the machines, Kyle Reece (Anton Yelchin - Star Trek). Unsure what has happened to him in his long sleep, Marcus agrees to help Kyle find John Connor so that the teen may enlist with the resistance.\r\n</p><p>As these two thin story threads slowly come together we get glimpses of the world ruled by SkyNet, their remorseless hunter killers, and their plans for John.\r\nInstead of 're-visioning '(the current Hollywood fad fashion) the studios hope to breathe new life into the Terminators with a trilogy of sequels set in the future. To craft this 'shit or bust' revival they hire Science Fiction and Action extraordinaire James Cameron ... oh, sorry, no, he's busy. Instead they hire McG, the infamous director of <i>Charlie's Angels</i>. \r\n</p><p>This revelation did not bode well and so once again I went to the cinema expecting to see a garbled rehash. Thankfully I was mistaken. That doesn't mean I was impressed, just adequately contented in my own pessimistic way.\r\n</p><p>Terminator Salvation has a strong visual style and has some good action sequences that give it a very strong look. The bleached colour scheme, the deserted ruined cities, the new plethora of robotic baddies all look the part. What the film lacks is a dominant lead character and a good story. The story is thin and has more holes than a bullet ridden corpse, too many to discuss here, so instead I'll mention the biggest problem, the characters. \r\n</p><p>Christian Bale is gravelly and troubled as John Connor as you would expect but the story doesn't really give him the opportunity to shine as an inspirational leader or tactician. Instead his character stumbles through the plot rather than driving it. Worthington does a bit better as the anti-hero seeking answers in an unfamiliar world and learning painfully his part in the saga. His rugged good looks definitely secure him the female votes. His character gets to kick ass quite a bit and this film will be a good springboard for his career (in fact one of his next projects is <i>Avatar</i>, the long awaited Science-Fiction flick from a certain James Cameron. \r\n</p><p>Hidden between these two action heroes there is a ray of light, we meet Kelchin as Kyle Reece. Unlike the troubled John struggling with the burden of destiny, young Kyle has a clear objective and we get to see him inspire his comrades and his new friend Marcus. Clearly a key player in the next two instalments, he could save the franchise.\r\n</p><p>A lads action film with some tough guys for the girls, Terminator Salvation was a good stab at resuscitating the franchise. Better than Mostow's part three but overshadowed by Cameron's two originals. Time will tell.\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	679	2011-03-26
680	1	20	\N	The Hangover	<p>\r\nFour lads head to Las Vegas for a stag night. They get into comedy capers and a heap of trouble, yet live to tell the tale. The story is simple and we've seen it all before but somehow this movie stands out. I attribute this to the advertising. Recent years have seen good comedies ruined by adverts crammed with the best bits leaving the final film flat. Not so here however, the trailer is hilarious and the movie expands upon it. Comedy is obviously down to personal taste so I can't guarantee everyone will love this film but for the majority it is fun adult comedy at its best. \r\n</p><p> \r\nWith a cast of relative newbie comedy talent and the always dazzling backdrop of Vegas the expectations didn't need to be high so when the comedy propels this film above expectations it is all the more fun. I wanna go to Vegas RIGHT NOW!!! \r\n</p><p> \r\nSo, being serious for a moment, four friends head to Vegas and after a few shots on the roof they promptly black out. They awake in a devastated hotel suite with a tiger and the stag has gone missing. Every clue to unravelling their evening leads to more comedy and complication. Because we're dealing with thirty plus lads there is none of the usual adolescent idiocy of <i>'Road Trip'</i> but more the mature madness of <i>'Old Skool'</i>.\r\n </p><p>\r\nLeading the search for the stag is best friend Phil (Bradley Cooper - He's Just Not That Into You) who is overly confident and suffering a little from the seven year itch, his brash energy and faith that they'll find their friend keeps things together. Lending maturity is the straight laced dentist Stu  (Ed Helms - The Office [TV]) who really lets his hair down, marries a hooker and loses a tooth. Finally completing the trio of heroes is Alan (Zach Galifianakis - What Happens in Vegas), a slightly unstable eccentric with delusions whose off hand comments and stupidity create some of the movie's best moments.\r\n</p><p> \r\nWhat about the stag? Does it matter, he is hardly in it, but there are plenty of cameos to make up for his absence including Heather Graham and Mike Tyson.\r\n</p><p>\r\nEnough of this nattering, this is a great film for fans of Vegas, couples who want a comedy and everyone else with a sense of humour. Go see it and escape this grim reality for an hour or two.\r\n</p><p> \r\n	4	2011-03-26	680	2011-03-26
681	1	15	\N	Transformers - Revenge of the Fallen	<p>\r\nA film based on a 1980's cartoon based on a toy line should never have been this good, but thanks to a healthy dose of childhood nostalgia, an enormous budget and plenty of thrills Transformers is the best brainless movie of the summer. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf - Bobby) is a typical teenager dealing with typical teenage problems. He is struggling to raise the money to buy his first car and he is unable to get the attention of Mikaela (Megan Fox - Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen), the hottest girl in school. All his troubles, however, are put into perspective when his ramshackle yellow Camaro transforms into a gigantic alien robot who wants him to help find a lost artefact that, in the wrong hands, could lay waste to all of mankind. \r\n</p><p>\r\nClearly Transformers is not a complex film but for it to succeed it did have to deliver for fans some truly astonishing fights scenes, which, after all, is what everyone has come to see. Thankfully special effects house Industrial Light and Magic are on excellent form. The robot transformations between their various guises are particularly well executed and they interact with their real world surroundings flawlessly. Much of that interaction is the Transformers demolition of buildings and other vehicles. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe big finale provides this blockbuster season with its most extraordinary action sequence as the Autobots and Decepticons go toe to toe in downtown Los Angeles. The mayhem the giant robots wreak is impressively wide both on land, as a villainous tank trades volleys with both human soldiers and the Autobots alike, and in the air where a Decepticon dogfights with F22 Raptors. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAt times director Michael Bay, as he has in his previous action films, takes us too close to the heart of the action often making fight scenes disorientating and difficult to keep up with. In his other films, however, he has also often dispensed with detailed characterisation and plot in order to get to the next explosion but here he has largely restrained himself, or been restrained by executive producer Steven Spielberg whose influence is often clear. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAlthough everyone watching the film obviously wants to see fifty foot tall robots knock dents into each other, the principal actors involved deserve a mention since, rather commendably, they hold their own against a tide of special effects. Star of the show Shia LaBeouf has been hailed as Hollywood's latest hot ticket, tomorrows Tom Hanks and Harrison Ford's future co-star in next summer's fourth Indiana Jones adventure. I for one couldn't see quite what the fuss is all about. He isn't especially handsome, his chatterbox delivery of dialogue is irritating and cocky Sam is difficult to like. \r\n</p><p>\r\nLove interest Megan Fox meanwhile is so eye wateringly attractive that I feared for my eyesight every time she writhed onto the screen. I have absolutely no idea whether she can act in the slightest but if you're male (and watching a film like Transformers probably means that you are) you probably won't care either. \r\n</p><p>\r\nMaking up cast are the US Rangers who first encounter the trigger happy Decepticons amid the sand dunes of Qatar. They are led by Josh Duhamal and Tyrese Gibson but their roles boil down to little more than pointing at monolithic robots, running away from said robots and occasionally stopping to fire back to little effect, all the while managing to look good with designer dirt smeared across their brows. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAt times logic completely deserts the film although I doubt many in the audience cared. I did wonder why when trying to escape the pursuing villains the army decided to make a fight in the most populated place they can find instead of making their stand in the desert? Someone offers an explanation along the lines of hiding from the baddies will be easier to do in the city but I couldn't help but fret about all the unnecessary civilian casualties that would have been prevented if only they had used their brains. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAlso very distracting but for a different reason is the subplot set in the Pentagon following the lead computer geek who cracks the Decepticons' communication code. Surprisingly Maggie (Rachael Taylor) isn't a social misfit riddled with acne but a blond Australian stunner who makes Elle McPherson look like Treebeard from Lord of the Rings. At least you can't accuse the filmmakers of stereotyping nerds but the scenes did slow down the main plot and I was sceptical every time her character uttered a stream of techno babble. \r\n</p><p>\r\nClearly Transformers isn't flawless but it is a lot of fun. Besides I was willing to forgive it a multitude of sins the moment the blue truck of Optimus Prime rolled up engine rumbling and original voice actor Peter Cullen gave the command, "Autobots, roll out!"\r\n</p>	1	2011-03-26	681	2011-03-26
682	1	4	\N	The Taking of Pelham 123	<p>\r\nNot a remake of the first film, but a retelling of the original book, The Taking of Pelham 123 is a cat-and-mouse thriller that propels you through the underground network of New York City's subway system.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe film stars Denzel Washington (American Gangster) as subway dispatcher Walter Garber, an ordinary man going into work on an ordinary day when his morning is thrown into chaos by one John Travolta (Be Cool) who plays a baddie, and he's one damn good baddie. Travolta stars as Ryder, the criminal mastermind behind a group of four meatheads who decide to hijack a train, with the usual threat of executing passengers if their ransom demands are not met within the hour.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nCue fast paced action as Garber uses his calming influence and vast knowledge of the subway system to try and outwit Ryder and save the hostages. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThe idea that someone would want to hijack a subway train is a no brainer, as how would the thieves escape once they get their money? But the well written script that was adapted to make it more relevant to today put paid to that. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nAlthough Washington is technically the hero, he plays a modest normal civil servant to a tee; someone you can imagine working in your office, and you really buy it. And considering it's supposed to be an action / thriller film, and Washington is such a big star, he played his role so succinctly and humbly, that you fell for him and I almost shed a little tear in compassion. Garber doesn't want to be the hero, but he's thrown into a position which he faces with such strength of character. When Garber realises the situation he says: "Look, where's the hostage negotiator? This is not what I do."\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nTravolta really relished the role of playing the bad guy, having fun with showing his character's wild, calm, mad, crazy and charming sides. But it was actually James Gandolfini (In The Loop), better known as Tony Soprano, who played the Mayor in the film who had some of the best lines. His nonchalant persona enabled his character to poke fun at himself and his role, which was very amusing. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nAlso credit due for a fantastic soundtrack, from '99 Problems' by Jay-Z to 'Counting Bodies Like Sheep' to the 'Rhythm of the War Drums' by A Perfect Circle, which also helped to build the suspense. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed the film, and originally I would have given it 3 stars as once you've seen a couple of hostage dramas, you've seen them all, but the performances of Washington and Travolta push this film into another league, so it definitely deserves all of its four stars.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nGoing back to my youth where I enjoyed such films as <i>Die Hard</i> and <i>Ransom</i>, if like me you liked these, then you'll definitely like this film.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	682	2011-03-26
684	1	20	\N	Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince	<p>\r\nAfter a longer than planned sojourn, the sixth instalment of the Harry Potter franchise arrives and the end is in sight. Following the unexpected success of chapter five, The Order of the Phoenix, a book with little action but padded with unnecessary plot diversions, anticipation for this instalment was high. As the last film before the finale, this movie had a lot of anticipation heaped upon it. Too much it would seem.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSet in Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe - HP5) sixth year at Hogwarts, the wizarding world finally acknowledges the return of the dark lord and as the storm clouds gather Dumbledore (Michael Gambon - Brideshead Revisited) takes Harry under his wing to help save the future. It transpires that for some time, years in fact, Dumbledore has been trying to uncover the past of Voldemort and a clue to his perceived immortality. The key to Voldemort's secret lies safely within the memories of a retired doddery wizard genius, Professor Slughorn (Jim Broadbent - Inkheart). \r\n</p><p>\r\nPlaying to Slughorn's vanities, Dumbledore convinces the bumbling old master to return to Hogwarts as potions teacher while Harry is given the mission of befriending the old codger and extracting from him the truth.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWhile Harry tries to win over the eccentric Slughorn, within Hogwarts some nasty events start to occur that play on Harry's suspicions. First off, Malfoy (Tom Felton - The Disaappeared) is being moodier than normal. He has been spotted consorting with death eaters and his behaviour has become distant and secretive. Added to this someone is playing around with cursed jewellery and poisonous mead. Distracting from this, Harry and his friends Hermione (Emma Watson - HP5) and Ron (Rupret Grint - HP5) have become engulfed in a hormonal tsunami. Ron is seduced by an overly affectionate girl causing Hermione heartache while his sister, Ginny (Bonnie Wright - HP5), makes a move on Harry who breaks all the lads rules by going along with it. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSo, loads going on but no real action except for a rushed scene with a zombie lake in a cave. This was always going to be the challenge with the Half Blood Prince and much would rest on the emotive power of the film's ending. Sadly it didn't quite hit the spot. Harry fans will know the scene I am talking about. The end of this film should shatter the established structure and should really pluck at the heart strings but it doesn't. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhat more could the director have done? I don't know, I'm just a critic. Maybe a bit more of moody Malfoy and brilliantly evil Snape and a little less pink fluffy teen romance would have made the film edgier.  Don't get me wrong, this is a good film, but the lack of action makes it long and the weakened ending seals its doom. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThis is very much the build up for the big final instalment and having read the book there is a lot to cram into the final two-part film. Hopefully the mass of action scenes in the finale of this franchise will make up for this damp penultimate chapter.\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	684	2011-03-26
690	1	20	\N	GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra	<p>\r\nBack in 2004 the makers of South Park created a puppet-based satire of American foreign policy called <i>'Team America - World Police'</i>. The story, for what it's worth, centred on a hero who joined an elite fighting force defending democracy from two dimensional villains who fail to prevent an attack on Paris but ultimately save the day.\r\n</p><p>\r\nI didn't realise until now what an amazing film that was. Not because it was good or even very funny, but because it managed to spoof an action movie five years before it was made!\r\n</p><p>\r\nG.I Joe follows the adventure of young hero Duke (Channing Tatum - Fighting) who joins an elite fighting force defending democracy from two dimensional villains who fail to prevent an attack on Paris but ultimately save the day.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSupporting Duke is his clich comedy sidekick, Marlon Wyans (Scary Movie) as Ripcord, Ray Park (DARTH MAUL) as a mute samurai type bloke (he's never allowed to talk in a film), and grizzled Dennis Quaid (Vantage Point) as the general. Oh and a load of other characters that it'd take an hour to describe. The villains are headed up by Christopher Ecclestone (Dr Who [TV]) and his chief lackeys Sienna Miller (Stardust) and Byung-hun Lee (Hero).\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe story is a non-existent mangle of any action flick with the villains threatening the world with a diabolical weapon and the all American heroes as the only people who can save us.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWatching this film is like watching an overlong Christmas advert with loads of product placement or a preview for the inevitable console game. The true wonder of this film is the casting. In addition to the young pretty things mentioned already (and Dennis Quaid who, though old, still packs a solid punch), the film boasts many big names and great little names. Arnold Vosloo (The Mummy), Brendan Fraser (The Mummy), Jonathan Pryce (Pirates of the Caribbean), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Brick), Brandon Soo Hoo (Tropic Thunder's mini highlight), and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (The Bourne Identity) all make an appearance.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThis is utter action pap at both its best and worst. Recommended for fans of no brainer action movies like 'The Fast and the Furious', 'Transporter' and 'Mission Impossible'.\r\n</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	690	2011-03-26
691	1	18	\N	The Yes Men Fix the World	<p>\r\nThe 'Yes Men' (Andy Bichlbaum and Mike Bonanno) are two gonzo activists who assume the identity of fake corporate executives in order to expose the greed and selfishness of some of the world's most powerful corporations.  The film tackles several issues which have not been adequately dealt with and challenge the governments and Capitalist faith in the 'free market.' </p><p> \r\nThe tongue in cheek approach taken by the 'Yes Men' is very clever and shows how naive so-called corporate giants are.  The humour is subtle and downright intelligent as they show clever media manipulation and easily trick their way into giving key note speeches at corporate functions.   \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe first issue the 'Yes Men' tackle is the Bhopal disaster in 1984, recognised as the world's largest chemical accident. Posing as a spokesperson from Dow, Bichlbaum is interviewed by the BBC and he claims Dow are taking full responsibility for the disaster outlining a pledge to help the families devastated by the chemical plant toxins.  While the 'Yes Men' are fooling the world and the BBC into believing they are representing Dow, it is ironic that the same highly respected global media  giant is also fooling its viewers into believing that the interview is live and from Paris. The reality is a small green room in the BBC office.  This shows just how much manipulation the media use on a daily basis.   This wry humour runs throughout the film which adds to the moral underlying need to tackle such issues. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe film is not scripted but is shot as a filmed experiment as the 'Yes Men' also deal with the consequences of their actions.  As they continue with their crusade it is quite interesting that they themselves are surprised by their own ability to evoke change in the market.  \r\n</p><p>\r\n'The Yes Men Fix the World' is a powerful documentary feature deserving all the recognition it has gained by winning the Berlin's Film Festival Audience award.  The world deserves to know exactly why such corporations are allowed to get away with these injustices' and how the government's support of free markets has adversely affected people around the world.  The 'Yes Men' use ingenious tactics and are clever with their subtle ways of exposing the sheer gutless wonder of corporations.  As their inventions become more ridiculous, they seem to be taken seriously by many of the guests at these events.  There is a warped satisfaction gained from watching the reactions of the audience as they try to understand the sheer preposterous concepts proposed by the 'Yes Men.'  \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhile a lot of their issues revolve primarily around the US government and corporations, their main message of taking a stand is not lost on the audience.  However, I wasn't fully convinced that the message the 'Yes Men' were trying to put across was always realised by their audiences which left me frustrated.  \r\nUltimately, the film does leave you with hope and I left thinking I would like to join the motley crew and support their fight against corporate greed.  If more people are brave enough to make a stand for their beliefs in humanity the world will shift in its cynical resigned view of the world.  \r\n</p>	4	2011-03-26	691	2011-03-26
694	1	20	\N	Moon	<p>\r\nOn the far side of the moon a lonely astronaught, Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell - Frost/Nixon), is getting excited about going home and seeing his lovely wife and their baby girl. Sam has been working alone at the lunar mining base for nearly three years and his only company has been a chirpy computer named Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey - 21).\r\n</p><p>\r\nSam's long tenancy and his solitude have allowed him time to improve himself and he is no longer the hot head astronaught that set out for the moon. He is a more reserved man who cares for his plants and wiles hours away slowly building a model of his home town. Heightening Sam's isolation, there is a problem with the radio and while he can receive messages from earth he cannot send any.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOne day while making a coffee Sam's peaceful and repetitive life is upturned when he sees a teenage girl sitting in his chair. So shocked, he slips and burns his hand. Sam is obviously worried he has been alone for too long. A few days later another hallucination causes him to crash his moon buggy into a mining machine and he loses consciousness.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAs Sam awakes he finds himself in the infirmary with the doting Gerty tending his wounds and advising rest. As Sam recovers he notices one of the mining machines is broken and inoperative. Gerty, mindful of Sam's fragility, initially forbids Sam from taking the moon buggy out again but relents. This act sets up the rest of the film.\r\nAs Sam goes out in the buggy to investigate the damaged machine he sees a crashed moon buggy. In the driver's seat is a dust covered space suit and inside is an unconscious injured astronaught that looks a lot like Sam.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIs it loneliness, is it a time loop, is it a clone, does he have a twin, is it some kind of delusion caused by head trauma, or is it an alien imposter stealing his identity? So the story begins and there are many little revelations and set pieces that suddenly propel this gentle science fiction movie forward.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn the central (only) role as Sam, Rockwell is on top form. As the original Sam starts to communicate with his young feisty doppelganger/hallucination/alien we see how much Sam has changed since he first went to the moon and get glimpses into his relationship with his wife. As the tension mounts with more and more revelations these two Sam's react differently. This must have been a great challenge and Rockwell delivered essentially two great performances. The only other significant character is Gerty, a boxy computer terminal that navigates the corridors offering assistance and concern in a smooth Spacey (pardon the unintentional pun) accent with only a small smiley to offer visual expression. Gerty is a lovely computer, at once an all knowing genius like Hal (2001) but with much more warmth.</p><p>\r\n\r\nThe individual story concept at play in this movie is not new and the budget does not allow for fantastic effects but the way these ingredients are all put together, and the fine acting, make this a superb film. What it lacks in originality it makes up for in heart. The film's director, Duncan Jones - Whistle), deserves credit for making a one man play into what I am sure will be a cult classic.\r\n</p><p>\r\nHow do I make comparisons without giving away twists? I would recommend this film to fans of <i>Alien</i>, <i>Bladerunner</i>, <i>Matrix</i>, <i>Capricorn One</i>, <i>Dark Star</i>, <i>Sixth Day</i> and <i>2001</i>. That should offer some guidance but not ruin surprises.\r\n</p> \r\n	5	2011-03-26	694	2011-03-26
704	1	16	\N	Surrogates	<p>\r\nIn a world where humans no longer roam the streets and instead send out their perfect 'surrogates' to live their lives for them, FBI agents Tom (Bruce Willis) and Peters (Radha Mitchell) have a new case to solve.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSurrogates are being hunted and killed but, in a new twist, if their human counterpart is still attached to them at the time of death they too will suffer the same demise.\r\n</p><p>\r\nTom and Peters are keen to uncover the mysterious surrogate killer and to understand more about his or her motives as well as the flaw with the surrogates.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSurrogates have become such an essential way of life that even some humans have remained locked away in isolation while the surrogate leads a full and normal life on the outside. Most humans are using the surrogates to mask a deeper pain or guilt hidden inside them. Some humans are just too afraid to ever return to their normal life.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWillis puts in his usual convincing performance as the strong agent while Mitchell pulls off the role as his headstrong and independent partner very well.\r\n</p><p>\r\nI did enjoy watching Surrogates but I'm not sure it added anything beyond the likes of similar futuristic movies such as <i>I, Robot</i> and <i>The Island</i>. \r\n</p><p>	3	2011-03-26	704	2011-03-26

739	1	16	\N	Up In the Air	<p>\r\nFrom the director of Juno, Jason Reitman, comes a comedy about a man who travels all around the US without an ounce of emotional baggage.\r\n</p><p>Ryan Bingham (George Clooney - Syriana) is a corporate downsizing expert or, sin simpler terms, the guy who is sent in to fire employees and do the boss' dirty work for them. He is at the top of his game and he enjoys nothing more than flying all over the country to 'let people go' without any remorse or pity. Ryan's prime objective is to collect as many loyalty points as he can wherever he goes. His only ambition in life is to hit his jackpot number of miles.\r\n</p><p>Ryan's target hits a stumbling point when protg Natalie (Anna Kendrick - New Moon) joins the company and pushes a new venture of 'Video Firing'. When Ryan realises his travelling days could be over he is determined to teach the new youngster about the real world and how the personal touch really does make a difference rather than trying to virtually fire someone through a computer screen.\r\n</p><p>Ryan reluctantly takes Natalie on the road to show her the ropes. During the trip Natalie uncovers more about her mysterious colleague and his aversion to forming close relationships. Even a chance meeting with a fellow traveller Alex (Vera Farmiga - Oprhan) sends his life into a spin.\r\n</p><p>When Ryan's sister gets married, he unwillingly shows up for the wedding with Alex in tow but forgoes all responsibilities. However, as it is suggested that the Bingham's parents are no longer around, Ryan does feel a sense of duty towards his sister and even helps to make sure the ceremony goes smoothly.\r\n</p><p>He learns some very valuable lessons about family, togetherness and love, mostly thanks to Alex and he could almost be a changed man.\r\n</p><p>Clooney puts in a convincing performance as the business man who likes to travel with an 'empty backpack' and Farmiga is superb as the classy love interest. Kendrick puts in a feisty performance as the ambitious protg in a more serious role than her Twilight days.\r\n</p><p>Up in the Air is a thoughtful romantic comedy with great acting, a good story and plenty of interesting metaphors. Definitely recommended for fans of <i>The Terminal</i> and <i>Last Chance Harvey</i>.\r\n</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	739	2011-03-26
742	1	1	\N	Lebanon	<p>Winner of the Leone d'Oro at the 66th Venice International Film Festival, this is far from an easy 90 mins to watch. But in the main for all the right reasons...\r\n\r\n</p><p>Director Samual Maoz charts an auto-biographical tale graphically presenting the viewer with a true taste of war itself. The first days of the Lebanese war in 1982 is the backdrop, but little is given in detail as to the whys and wherefores. It doesn't really matter a damn which part of modern history this is from, the purpose is to get across the atmosphere, the claustrophobia and the stench of life in a tank at war.\r\n\r\n</p><p>We spend the majority of the film looking through the cross-hairs of the tank's sight, adding to the feeling of helplessness, confusion and complete lack of knowledge of where they are and what they are trying to achieve. This is incredibly effective for the viewer, always straining to see what the blurry and cracked view finder is trying to show us. The only other perspectives are cramped shots of the disgusting innards of the tank, the increasingly sweaty, smudgy soldiers and their petrified prisoner of war. Dirty oily puddles, cigarette butts and soup pellets pepper the scene and by the end of the film you want to run out and have a good bath and scrub away the putridness of what you have seen and felt.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Moving in to an urban area that the platoon is ordered to clear out, the filming style really comes in to its own. The desperate search for any danger, the attraction of the macabre, the shocking, the poignant is everywhere; a dying donkey staring back with its leaking eye, the old man sat at the side of the street, sat next to his chess companion who didn't make it, the desperate search of a semi-naked young mother looking for her lost daughter. The misery and desperation of the situation, both for the civilians and the soldiers inside the tank is as tangible as it gets on film. Impressive stuff.\r\n\r\n</p><p>But it is at this point that it begins to run out of steam. To maintain the shock, the energy and the empathy for 90 mins when confined to the dirty walls of a single tank and four men who have very similar outlooks to the war itself,  is a tall task, and it doesn't quite come up to the challenge. The lack of detail, of background and any knowledge of the Lebanese war itself, is part of the disorientation at the beginning, and is highly effective in making the viewer empathise with the characters in the film. But it doesn't hold the viewer all the way through. As a tool to get people to understand the horrific experiences of soldiers at war, it could have stopped at 60 mins and have been just as effective. In fact, it could have been more effective. The last scenes aren't bad, in fact they are good, but they don't add anything to the things that made an impact at the beginning. \r\n\r\n</p><p>The actors themselves are strong, although are overshadowed by the fantastic stylistic choices in filming. They are secondary to the atmosphere and the claustrophobia that the viewer is exposed to. This is a film that tells us what war really is. If you want action and thrills, play <i>Call of Duty</i> or watch <i>Independence Day</i>. If you want a true reflection of the experiences and emotions that soldiers go through every day on the front line, then definitely give this the time of day.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	742	2011-03-26
748	1	20	\N	Iron Man 2	<p>\r\nAnother summer. Another action movie. Another comic book adaptation. The stars of Marvel comics have become a staple of the box office over the past few years, with smashes that include the Spider-Man, X-Men and Blade trilogies, as well as the two Fantastic Four offerings. Even the so-called 'disappointing' offerings haven't provided serious setbacks for the corporation. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nAnd with the release of Iron Man, Marvel Studios' first entirely self-financed film, the juggernaut looks set to keep on rolling. Crowd-pleasing, although hardly original, Iron Man makes for surprisingly entertaining viewing. With the right balance of humour, action and story it is a gripping movie, although perhaps a little stretched at times. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nTony Stark, the drink-swilling, high-rolling, fun-loving, womanising CEO of Stark Industries, is captured by terrorists while demonstrating the latest high-tech weapon of mass destruction. Using his vast intelligence and ingenuity (did we mention he is also a genius inventor) he escapes after building an impressive suit of armour, laden with various gadgets enabling his escape. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nIt is an impressive first quarter, if slightly reminiscent of the A-Team's ability to build tanks from cars with a bit of sticky-back plastic! His time in captivity has been a life-altering experience for the billionaire, who renounces his company's weapon-producing in favour of finding ways to protect humanity. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nIt could so easily have gone wrong at this point, but with acclaimed director Jon Favreau (Swingers) at the helm it remains on course. A surprise choice at first, it's hard to imagine anyone who is better suited to the role of Stark than Robert Downey Jr (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang). His portrayal of the arrogant, and occasionally vulnerable, hero is absolutely riveting. Quick-witted, perfectly dry and world weary Downey plays the role to perfection. He is matched by the virtually unrecognisable Jeff Bridges (Surfs Up), who suits up as brilliantly villainous Obadiah Stane, Tony's right-hand man at Stark Industries. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nWhile Gwyneth Paltrow (Infamous) and Terrance Howard (Awake) both thrive in their perhaps slightly under-developed supporting roles, with Paltrow delivering a forties-esque performance as Stark's girl Friday. The chemistry between Paltrow and Downey is palpable. They positively sparkle, bringing sincerity, honesty and old-fashioned comedy to their relationship. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nAt times the story feels a little drawn out (the building montages spring to mind), and yet it also feels a little underdeveloped at other points. And yes, it isn't the most original film around. It's predictable. The twists are easy to work out. But all in all, Iron Man is a visually-stunning, highly amusing and extremely satisfying romp, with a hero who is rooted in the 'real' world. He is flawed, he has lived (boy, has he lived!) and he has made mistakes. He's not a mutant, he hasn't received super-powers as a result of a science experiment gone wrong or been the victim of a radioactive spider bite! For all his wealth and arrogance, he's just a man who has a way with technology and an exceptionally inventive mind. It is this that makes it all the more enjoyable.\r\n</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	748	2011-03-26
759	1	16	\N	Step Up 3D	<p>Our screens continue to be saturated by feel-good dance movies and even our television screens have not escaped with the return of the ever-popular <i>Strictly Come Dancing</i>.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe latest venture into the genre is Step Up. Tyler (Channing Tatum - She's The Man) is a degenerate teen who constantly finds himself in trouble and facing a juvenile court judge on a regular basis.\r\n</p><p>\r\nTyler lives at home with his foster parents and siblings but his unfulfilling home life pushes him to spend more time with his hoodlum friends Mac (Damaine Radcliff - Glory Road) and his little brother Skinny (De'Shawn Washington).\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter a night of trespassing and destruction with his mates, Tyler is caught by a security guard and faces the judge yet again. The judge sentences him to serve 200 hours of community service at the scene of the crime, a performing arts school full of "rich kids".\r\n</p><p>\r\nTyler reports to the school's principal Director Gordon (Rachel Griffiths - Six Feet Under [TV]) who assigns him janitor duties. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDuring his stint at the school, Tyler observes from the sidelines the sheer amount of dancing and musical talent among the pupils. He especially takes a fancy to pretty dancer Nora (Jenna Dewan - Take the Lead) who is busy practicising a routine for her showcase piece.\r\n</p><p>\r\nNora's dream is to be a successful dancer and she hopes her showcase will catch the eye of a prestigious dance company. Nora is determined to work hard on her piece and to produce the best showcase possible. Her dance partner is a fellow pupil and, with the support of her boyfriend Brett (Josh Henderson - Yours, Mine and Ours), she is prepared to put in all the necessary training hours to make it a success. Not only does Nora need to get the routine right but she also needs to choose the right backing track and her friend Miles (played by singer Mario) is on hand to deliver the best tune.\r\n</p><p>\r\nJust when everything seems to be running smoothly, Nora's dance partner is forced to pull out of training due to injury. Nora is left in a desperate situation and needs to find a replacement fast. Cue Tyler, an experienced hip-hop dancer, who steps up to take on the challenge. Nora is apprehensive at first but she has seen his moves and decides the risk is worth it.\r\n</p><p>\r\nTyler and Nora spend more and more time together and really start to hit it off. Meanwhile, Mac is putting pressure on Tyler to spend time with him on the basketball court.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter a falling out with Nora over his timekeeping, Tyler decides to give up on the dancing and return to his hoodlum ways. Nora continues dancing solo and Tyler wins back his friend's trust.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIt takes a horrific tragedy to make Tyler realise what is really important in life and he learns that he cannot give up all the time. Tyler has to fight to win back Nora's trust and the pair finally start dancing again and come up with a kick-arse routine.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWill Tyler and Nora make it to the final showcase performance without any other hiccups?\r\n</p><p>\r\nTatum is simply scrumptious and hot as the funky groover while Dewan is on top form again as the dancing queen following her last impressive role as Sasha in <i>Take the Lead</i>. \r\n</p><p>\r\n<b>Step Up</b> is an entertaining movie with impressive dance routines and great chemistry between the leads. Don't expect an original plot, it has been seen soo many times before, but enjoy the rhythms and sexy grooves.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFans of <i>Save the Last Dance</i>, <i>Honey</i> and <i>Take the Lead</i> are sure to love this movie. However, its predecessors were much better movies boasting either greater acting, better dancing or more high profile stars. </p>	9	2011-03-26	759	2011-03-26
774	1	27	\N	Saw 3D	<p>Considering the large number of horror films knocked out each year, classic examples of the genre tend to be something of an endangered species. A precious few stand out as a cut above the rest and survive beyond their opening weekend at the multiplex. \r\n</p><p>\r\nPrevious decades have given us <i>The Exorcist</i>, <i>Halloween</i> and <i>Alien</i>, examples of great horror pictures that have stood the test of time. The horror franchise that defined the nineties was Wes Craven's <i>Scream</i> Trilogy. Until this serial killer made his first sinister phone call, horror was in the doldrums, but then with a sly wink and plenty of scares Craven revitalised the slasher flick for all those jaded by years of ambition-free efforts. <i>Scream</i> was all too aware of the ridiculous nature of most horror films and used this knowledge to its advantage; it managed to mix characterisation, comedy and jumps to decent effect over three films. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWith over half of this decade already gone horror films currently tend to be part of one of two camps, the psychological eastern horrors (and their western remakes) and the splatter films like those made by Eli Roth. Of this second group the <i>Saw</i> franchise, which has now managed to churn out a picture three Halloweens in a row, has been the most successful. \r\n</p><p>\r\nUnfortunately <i>Saw III</i> has none of the attributes that made <i>Scream</i> a good film. Despite some truly hideous deaths it is not in the least bit frightening. Attempts at characterisation have sunk so low that the victims are given one-line introductions before being killed off. And as for laughs, that really depends on whether your find someone drowning in liquefied rotting pig funny? \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe two principal heroes this time around are a grieving father trapped in a warehouse of death and a doctor who is given the challenge of keeping the terminally ill Jigsaw killer alive or having her head blown off. Neither are remotely interesting people nor do their characters develop but then again that isn't surprising since they aren't the film's main characters. \r\n</p><p>\r\nTaking centre stage instead are serial killer Jigsaw (Tobin Bell - um, other Saw films) and his loopy protg Amanda (Shawnee Smith - The Island), who seems to be having some trust issues as the new girl on the block prepares to inherit her bedridden boss' mantle. \r\n</p><p>\r\nRather shockingly <i>Saw III</i> pushes the depravity well beyond the limits set by Roth's Hostel earlier in the year. The first fifteen minutes feature a policeman smashing his own foot to pulp, an ex-convict tearing loose chains that are looped through his skin and finally a woman secured in a harness has her rib cage ripped apart after dipping her hand in acid. Easy viewing this is not and I simply can't see the point of it. It is the cinematic equivalent of watching a child torture insects for an hour and a half. \r\n</p><p>\r\nGood horror films are like theme park roller coasters, they might scare you shitless but in the end you come out having enjoyed the experience. The only quality Saw III shares with a theme park ride is that by the end it might make you want to vomit.\r\n</p>	9	2011-03-26	774	2011-03-26
780	1	16	\N	Monsters	<p>\r\n<b>Monsters</b> is an alien invasion film with a unique approach, considering the aliens themselves rarely feature. Director and writer Gareth Edwards, in his feature film debut, has created a surprisingly effective blend of innovative alien-incursion tropes, political themes and endearing relationship drama. It is to his considerable credit that he has managed to do so on a shoestring budget compared to other more 'Hollywood' films of this type. \r\n</p>\r\nPhoto journalist Andrew Caulder (Scoot McNairy) finds himself in the unenviable position of having to escort his boss' daughter Samantha Wynden (Whitney Able) across an infected zone filled with alien life forms that crash-landed on earth six years prior to the story's opening. At first downright indignant, Caulder soon warms to his task, and it quickly becomes evident that this is much more of a love story than your typical alien movie. Using relatively unknown actors works in the film's favour, and Edwards' technique of providing just the gist of what he wanted in each scene before allowing his cast to improvise the finer details makes for some highly impressive performances from the main duo. \r\n</p>\r\nIndeed, it is easy to forget that there are nasty aliens lurking out there, such is the level of emotional investment the audience soon begins to feel for Caulder and Wynden. Both characters have to bear the burden of troubling issues in their lives which are kept at bay by their incursion into the infected zone, and their aversion to having to go back to normality highlights the growing affection they have for each other as the story progresses. In fact, we only see glimpses of the beastly aliens during the last scene in the film, when Edwards confirms our suspicions that these invaders are not quite as fearsome as the authorities would have the citizens of Mexico and the US believe. Instead, they are portrayed as beautiful and even magical natural creations, wandering around a strange world they cannot hope to ever call home. \r\n</p>\r\nMonsters is an exceptionally impressive debut from Edwards, with fine acting from its two lead actors, some wonderful cinematography using the Mexican setting to great effect, and a young director flexing his muscles to create a new twist on the typical alien invasion story. It succeeds because Edwards is not afraid to be bold and inventive, thus elevating the film to a higher status than such Hollywood fare as <i>'War of the Worlds'</i>. \r\n</p>	4	2011-03-26	780	2011-03-26
785	1	18	\N	Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows P1	<p>It's important to remember there are two sets of people in this world: those who are fans of JK Rowling's series of young adult novels, and those who aren't. Being indifferent to the Harry Potter phenomenon is not an easy thing to do. It's a bit like marmite - you either love it or it's the last thing you want to put on your toast. This latest instalment, while managing to remain accessible for anyone who has not seen what came before, is perhaps the least action-oriented so far.  Director David Yates manages to ensure that having less dramatic action scenes in no way detracts from the impact of the film as a whole. </p>\r\nMore of a road movie than its predecessors, the first part of this long-awaited denouement sees our young band of heroes - Harry (Daniel Radcliffe - December Boys), Ron (Rupert Grint - Wild Target) and Hermione (Emma Watson - Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince) - set off to find and destroy the horcruxes which make up the seven pieces of Voldermort's soul, ridding themselves of his evil presence once and for all. The journey is fraught with danger and complication, and Yates - by now a Harry Potter veteran - does an excellent job of capturing the angst of the three youngsters as they face no end of frustrating dead ends and conflicting emotions at their seemingly fruitless plight. </p>\r\nIn fact, it is the tone of the film that makes it such a fine effort from Yates. There is no escaping the bleak fate of Harry and his companions as they journey from one remote destination to another, and yet again the cinematography is superb, with dynamic vistas forming a majestic backdrop to events while highlighting the futility of their quest. The performances of all three young leads are to be commended, and for loyal followers who have been there since the beginning, it must be a considerable source of pleasure to watch the assured progress they have made. Watson and Grint in particular are regularly showing greater confidence and variety in their roles, playing the coy teenagers trying to juggle their obvious love for one another amid all the turmoil of the situation with some degree of perfection. </p>\r\nBut where this first part of the Deathly Hallows truly succeeds is in setting us up for its own conclusion, due next year. Events are set in motion, our heroes' journey is barely half-way, and the stage is set for an enthralling finale. While perhaps not quite reaching the heights of <i>The Order of the Phoenix</i> or <i>The Half-Blood Prince</i>, the sixth entry in the Harry Potter canon is another impressive piece of work. </p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	785	2011-03-26
790	1	25	\N	Tron Legacy	<p><b>Tron: Legacy</b> is the long-awaited sequel to the 1982 adventure romp which saw computer programmers become trapped in a virtual world and forced to fight for their survival. Now, 28 years later, Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund - Eragon) follows in his father's footsteps into a digital world quite unlike anything seen before on the big screen.  \r\n</p><p>The plot itself is pretty thin - After a meeting with Alan Bradley (Bruce Boxleitner - Heroes [TV]), Sam is lured to his father's secret workshop and transported to the digital domain known as the Grid. There, he sets about trying to survive with the help of the beautiful Quorra (Olivia Wilde - House [TV]) and goes out in search of his father Kevin (Jeff Bridges - Iron Man). \r\n</p><p>Joseph Kosinski makes a striking directorial debut and shows considerable ambition in taking on something of a cult favourite, never shirking from the responsibility of keeping notoriously fickle sci-fi fans happy. And for the most part, he succeeds with aplomb. As I said before, the plot is several rungs below the likes of Inception, and I suspect that the film will not be making any Oscar waves outside of special effects. Yet there is a great deal to be commended here, and there can be no doubt that this is a proper event movie, complete with incredible visual effects and some superbly edited action sequences. The achievement of bringing the digital Grid to life without looking like something that was left on the cutting floor of The Matrix is indeed an impressive one. \r\n</p><p>Tron: Legacy is exactly the type of film that the 3D revolution can point to as evidence of its growing influence, so stirring is the virtual environment created.  As to be expected however, there are areas which could be improved. Bridges, mostly giving a fine performance as the man doomed to never leave the Grid, sometimes seems to forget himself and slip into something a little more reminiscent of his role as the 'dude' in The Big Lebowski. Furthermore, the evil machinations of Clu, Kevin Flynn's young clone, seem just a little ridiculous. How exactly is he planning to invade the real world with nothing but a few thousand talking megabytes? Finally, the under-use of Cillian Murphy (Inception) in a negligible role as a corporate hacker should never have been allowed. Seeing Michael Sheen (New Moon) ham it up as a gyrating club owner is of some consolation. \r\n</p><p>But given the scale and scope of the film as a whole, these are relatively minor objections. Tron: Legacy is a film to be appreciated for its grandeur and boldness, and deserves to be acclaimed for presenting us with a believable alien world in keeping with the best elements of the original. A mention too for the powerfully dramatic score provided by French electro-pop duo Daft Punk, perfectly suited to the Grid's highly charged ambience. </p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	790	2011-03-26
791	1	4	\N	Burlesque	<p>Ali (Christina Aguilera), a small town girl from Iowa, has hopes and dreams to ditch her menial life as a waitress and head to the bright lights of Hollywood.\r\n</p><p>After several failed dance and singing auditions, Ali happens across an interesting Burlesque club. Mistaking it for a strip club, club host Alexis (Alan Cumming - Jackboots on Whitehall) persuades her to stay and check out what it is really all about.\r\n</p><p>The club is owned by Tess (Cher - Mermaids) who is struggling to keep her business in profit. Even though she has amazing dancers, the income just isn't enough. Her ex-husband Vince (Peter Gallagher - The OC [TV]) is keen to sell the club to local businessman Marcus (Eric Dane - Valentine's Day) for a good price but Tess is reluctant to let go of her precious club.\r\n</p><p>After watching Tess and the dancers in action, Ali is keen to get in front of Tess to sell herself and her abilities. She is instantly dismissed but stage manager Sean (Stanley Tucci - The Lovely Bones) recommends that she comes back when they hold the official auditions.\r\n</p><p>Dejected but not giving up, Ali befriends barman Jack (Cam Gigandet - Twilight) and convinces him to take her on as a waitress. She is confident that if she can get in front of Tess and perform she will be blown away.\r\n</p><p>Ali was right and before she knows it she is on stage with the other dancers. Little do they know but Ali has a fantastic voice and soon lip-synching at the club is a thing of the past. But Ali hasn't made too many friends at the club, especially not Nikki (Kristen Bell - Get Him to the Greek) who feels like Ali is muscling in on her territory.\r\n</p><p>With no family or friends to turn to, Ali crashes at Jack's apartment until she can find somewhere permanent to stay. They drive each other crazy but they manage to resolve their differences in the end.\r\n</p><p>Most of their time is spent apart as Jack speaks to his long distance fiance and Ali is being wooed by the rich Marcus.\r\n</p><p>But can the show still go on as Tess' club struggles to make money? Can Ali turn it all around in time? You'll have to watch the movie to find out.\r\n</p><p>In her film debut, Aguilera isn't stretched on the acting front but she is superb at what she does best - singing and dancing. The routines are fast, sexy and catchy. Cher puts in an emotional performance as the club owner desperate to keep her business afloat but was outshined by Aguilera on the singing front. Gigandet is great eye candy for the women (when he isn't wearing eye liner) but he does have some cringeworthy romantic moments. As always, a great performance from Tucci, however he seems to be typecast lately as the camp sidekick.\r\n</p><p>As the target audience for Burlesque, I really enjoyed this movie. It's a great feel good movie to go and see with the girls. It has glitter, glamour, superb dancing and amazing singing. What more could a girl want? Fans of <i>Show Girls</i> and <i>Moulin Rouge</i> are sure to enjoy this musical extravaganza!</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	791	2011-03-26
793	1	27	\N	Outcast	<p><i>Outcast</i> is a low budget horror film set in a grim council estate in the North. It focuses on Mary (Kate Dickie - Donkeys) and her teenage son Fergal (Niall Bruton - Uncle Bills Barrow) who move to another new home, as they are always on the run, hiding from something, which we don't understand until later.\r\n \r\n</p><p>As a normal teenager would, Fergal tries to make friends with the local youths and finds himself attracted to a beautiful, yet feisty neighbour in the form of Petronella (Hannah Stanbridge - Lip Service), much to his mother's disgruntlement. No-one understands why Mary is dead against Fergal's relationship with Petronella, believing that Mary just wants to protect her son. \r\n \r\n</p><p>Meanwhile in another grim and grey field, where what appears to be a set of travellers, is their hunter in the form of Cathal (James Nesbitt - The Deep), who is a scary character, intent on tracking Mary and the boy down. In order to do so he uses black magic. But in order to remain hidden, Mary too is using her own form of ancient rituals to protect her and her son. So the story becomes a game of cat and mouse.\r\n \r\n</p><p>In addition to this central story, a number of the town folk end up brutally murdered by what is referred to as the beast. No-one sees the beast, apart from the odd claw that comes out just before someone is dragged away. \r\n \r\n</p><p>With Cathal appearing to be such an evil character, it is easy to presume as the viewer that it is all his doing, but there's a predictable twist which brings the whole story together.\r\n \r\n</p><p>I have to admit the whole film jarred a little with me - the whole real grim northern council estate was quite normal, but then the film became far fetched and the two sides didn't really come together for me. I love James Nesbitt, but I felt this role was a bit odd for him. Everyone else is virtually a new name. \r\n \r\n</p><p>You'd love this film if you like any gritty Channel 4 film, or if you like the grim reality of <i>Trainspotting</i> mixed with <i>Nightmare on Elm Street</i>.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	793	2011-03-26
766	1	27	Blah	Going the Distance	<p>Garrett (Justin Long - Drag Me to Hell) is an assistant music scout working in Manhattan. He is fed up of having to promote manufactured bands and aspires to support the real unsigned talent out there.</p>\r\n\r\nIn his social life, his lack of attentiveness has sent his latest girlfriend running but Garrett isn't overly distraught and is instead content with moaning about it over a pint with his friends Dan (Charlie Day - A Quiet Little Marriage) & Box (Jason Sudeikis - The Bounty Hunter). </p>\r\n\r\nIn the same pub that night is aspiring journalist Erin (Drew Barrymore - Music & Lyrics) who is finishing up an internship at a newspaper. She is trying to find a permanent job so that she can stay in the city and pursue her journalism dream. </p>\r\n\r\nErin and Garrett bump into each other at the pub's games machine and discover that they share a lot of mutual interests. Despite Garrett's very recent break-up, he sees an immediate connection with Erin so they start hanging out together. </p>\r\n\r\nEven though they know their time together is brief, Erin & Garrett are determined to have as much fun together as they can before Erin has to move back to San Francisco. </p>\r\n\r\nWhen reality hits and the pair are about to separate, they decide that they can't live apart and decide to keep the relationship going long distance. Cue long distance visits and lame attempts at phone sex to keep the relationship alive! </p>\r\n\r\nBut when Erin gets offered a job in San Francisco she has to weigh up whether to ditch her dream to be with the man she loves or to stay put and give up on love. </p>\r\n\r\nBarrymore and Long are suitably sweet as the loved-up couple, probably more convincingly because of their off-screen chemistry, however Long just seems like the young boy in the relationship. </p>\r\n\r\nMost of the best humour comes from the fantastic sidekicks, namely Day & Sudeikis, and great big sister "cringe" moments from Christina Applegate (Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore) as Erin's older and wiser sister, Corrine. </p>\r\n\r\n<i>Going the Distance</i> is an average romantic comedy, you'll have seen most of it before. Fans of Leap Year will enjoy this movie. </p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	766	2012-03-08
787	1	25	"They just f****d with the wrong Mexican"	Machete	<p>Robert Rodriguez's Machete is an action packed exploitation movie with an all star cast packed full of stunts using the Machete and other blade wielding weapons. </p>\r\nDanny Trejo (Predators) plays the namesake Machete,  an ex federal agent who is framed for an attempted political assassination of Texas State Senator McLaughlin (Robert De Niro - Righteous Kill).  As Machete sets out to clear his name he is helped by vigilante Luz (Michelle Rodriguez - Avatar) and Padre (Cheech Marin - Lost [TV]) while trying to fight against Booth, a crooked business man, Von, a twisted borderline vigilante, and Sartana (Jessica Alba - Valentine's Day), the sexy immigrations officer, who is torn between upholding the law and living by her own strong principles of fighting for justice.    </p>\r\nThe film was finally produced after a cult following for Machete began in Mexico while Rodriguez was shooting Danny Trejo's small role in <i> "Desperado." </i>   Seeing the potential in Danny's on screen presence, Rodriguez began to formulate the idea for Machete, which again picked up momentum with the trailer for<i> "Grindhouse." </i>  </p>\r\nSure, the storyline is predictable to say the least.  There is nothing original about an ex-federal clearing his name while being thwarted by baddies and being distracted by beautiful women along the way. It is a tongue-in-cheek film which is laughing at its own ridiculous dialogue full of clichs and over the top dramatic scenes such as Lindsay Lohan (Ugly Betty [TV]) donning a nun's outfit while avenging her father's death.  However, for me the film did not strike a balance with that by exploring the moral issues or character conflicts enough.  The political state of immigration issues in America is portrayed in its most brutal form but without any real resolution or any moral message to underline the racist attitudes shown by white middle -class Texans.  </p>\r\nMoreover, the audience are let in on the framing and real intentions of the 'baddies' early on and I found myself feeling impatient and irritated waiting for Machete and Co to 'catch up' and defeat the enemy. </p>\r\nIf you are after a movie filled with blood, violence with some scenes of nudity and some corny dialogue from actors not afraid to make fun of themselves, you will enjoy this.  There is a Tarantino feel to the film and it does echo films such as <i>"From Dusk till Dawn" </i>and <i> "Desperados" </i>but for me it fell short of anything memorable apart from one particular knife wielding scene involving the clever use of the human intestine to escape the baddies - you'll have to watch the movie to see what I mean.   </p>	2	2011-03-26	787	2012-03-08
778	1	25	Blah	Mary and Max	<p>This film is a "claymation", an animated film made with little plasticine characters. The film spans 20 years and two continents, and explores the relationship between chubby, lonely 8-year-old Mary (voiced by Toni Collette - Muriel's Wedding) in Australia and Max (Philip Seymour Hoffman - Synecdoche, New York), a 44-year-old seriously overweight Jewish man with Aspergers in New York. Mary chooses Max at random from a phonebook one day at the post office when her drunken mother was off "borrowing" stationery, and she decided she wanted a new friend. She asks this friend innocent, yet inappropriate questions such as "Where do babies come from?", or as Mary puts it "Do babies come from coke cans in New York, because my Mum says they are found at the bottom of beer glasses here in Australia."</p>\r\n \r\nThis film chronicles the relationship between these two very different people, over 20 years, showing all the ups and downs in their relationship, as Mary passes from childhood to adulthood, and while Max passes from middle age to old age. The film often sets the mood by altering the amount of colour. The film is mainly set in black and white, with shades of grey, and the odd splash of brown and red! </p>\r\n\r\nAs Mary grows up, she loses both her parents, marries the guy next door (Eric Bana - The Other Boleyn Girl) before life takes a dark turn. Meanwhile Max blunders through life, having his little turns and not understanding the world he lives in. Until he wins the lottery, and then buys a lifetime supply of chocolate and gives the rest to his blind neighbour. </p>\r\n \r\nMe, I love a good childish comedy, and yes, I enjoyed this "childish" film for its adult qualities and one-liners but halfway through the film turned quite dark. This too I would enjoy under normal circumstances, but as I was expecting light humour throughout, I was surprised. The content took a serious turn when it started to talk about the grim reality of serious mental disorder, loneliness, suicide and death. Oh joy! But credit where credit is due, this film is both funny and poignant as it explores topics such as friendship, autism, taxidermy, psychiatry, alcoholism, obesity, kleptomania, sexual differences, trust, copulating dogs, religious differences, agoraphobia (or as Mary calls it homophobia) and many other taboos. But even though a lot of grim subjects were broached, it was easy to handle and actually quite sweet and innocent because it was discussed between a naive child and a chap with mental illness. It was light hearted, and even a little optimistic. </p> \r\n \r\nDue to it being a claymation, I was expecting more Wallace and Gromit, but instead got more Tim Burton, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. You would like this film if you enjoyed such delights as <i>Corpse Bride</i>, <i>Pans Labyrinth</i> or <i>About Schmidt</i>. </p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	778	2012-03-08
792	1	25	Quite simply the worst film I have ever seen, and I've seen <i> Howard the Duck</i>	Zombie Driftwood	<p>I'm not quite sure how films like this get made. Who gives the green light for these films to be screened in cinemas across the nation? Whoever is responsible, they need to have a long hard look at themselves, because this is quite simply the worst film I have ever seen, and I've seen <i> Howard the Duck</i>.</p>\r\n<p>The story is simple enough. A cruise ship is enveloped by a mysterious green fog which transforms all the passengers into mindless zombies, before they turn up en masse on the beach of the idyllic Cayman Island resort where the film is set. Meanwhile two young holidaymakers, Gordon (Brian Braggs) and Jackie (Rita Estevanovich) and two world-weary drinkers, Tom (Colin Wilson) and Teddy (Mike McLaughlin) are passing the time in the Driftwood Bar, run by Canadian hick Dan (Peter Kosa). Soon enough the zombies are surrounding the bar, leaving our 'heroes' with a struggle to survive.</p>\r\n<p>From there, the film largely goes through the motions typical of a zombie flick, with some characters surviving and others (thankfully) meeting a gory fate, but does so without even a shred of substance or style. It is clearly meant to be a horror-comedy, but there is very little either horrifying or funny about proceedings here. The acting is strictly amateurish, and the dialogue is even worse. I can only assume the script was written in a bar much like the Driftwood itself, in one night and with the assistance of far too much alcohol. The camerawork is shoddy at best, with some cuts looking almost accidental, and the score is ridiculously loud, the music or even the traffic at times almost drowning out the voices of the actors. </p>\r\nBut most of all it is the risible attempts at humour which let the film down. The poor acting and laughable script would be easier to contend with if there was at least a shred of intelligence or wit about the comedy of the film. Instead we are treated to pathetic shots of zombie hands being chopped off and some cheap sex scenes which are ludicrously gratuitous. It says something about the film that comments from the audience were a great deal more amusing than what was served up on screen. </p>\r\n<p>It doesn't help that all the characters are hugely unsympathetic, leaving nothing for the audience to care about or invest their emotion in, and you simply don't care who dies and who makes it out alive.  The zombies themselves are pretty average, and given the modest production budget it comes as no surprise that the visual effects are poor, in keeping with all other aspects of the film. We even have to put up with an unknown heavy metal band playing their new song - for no apparent reason - in the middle of the film in what has to be the most unwelcome example of blatant plugging ever seen. </p>\r\n<p>In the end the zombies are defeated by bagpipes, a fact which sums the film up nicely. The production company behind Zombie Driftwood is new, and their objective to build a sustainable production business in the Cayman Islands is a commendable one; however they have a lot of work ahead if they are to succeed in carving out a name for themselves. </p>\r\n<p>Sadly, the movie is nothing more than a poor sun-drenched imitation of <i>Shaun of the Dead</i>. </p>	0	2011-03-26	792	2012-03-11

832	1	27	\N	Rio	<p><i>Rio</i> is a colourful fun filled adventure that follows the story of Blu (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg - <i>The Social Network</i>), a rare blue macaw, that through a quirk of fate has lived his whole life in a bookshop in freezing Minnesota. Blu loves his life with his owner, Linda, who has cared for him since he was a chick. Sadly the years of living in a warm bookshop has meant that Blu never learnt to fly. All that is about to change.\n\n</p>One day a bumbling ornithologist stumbles into Linda's bookshop to congratulate her for owning such a fine bird, Blu. It transpires that Blu is the last known blue macaw and that his species is on the verge of extinction. Luckily the ornithologist has a female blue macaw, Jewel (Anne Hathaway - <i>Love and Other Drugs</i>) in his bird sanctuary in fabulous Rio and he invites both Linda and Blu to visit in the hope that together they can save the species.\n\n</p>So that is the setup, a neurotic flightless blue parrot finds himself in Rio on a blind date. As you can imagine things do not go swimmingly. Firstly Jewel is not a domesticated parrot. She is a beautiful independent lady and hates living in the confined sanctuary. She hopes to escape and has no interest in weedy Blu. Secondly, as the last two blue macaws in existence Blu and Jewel are worth quite a bit of money and smugglers steal them from the sanctuary in hopes of selling them on. \n\n</p>Chained together Blu and Jewel manage to escape the smugglers but are then lost in the city. Befriended by some local birds they set off on an adventure through the streets of Rio all the while being pursued by the nasty smugglers and their evil Parrot Nigel. \n\n</p>Rio is a nice change. It is a family film that tells the well trodden story of finding your identity and facing up to challenges but it does it in a slightly different way. The numerous musical scenes and the gentle but light hearted romance are all reminiscent of the classic Disney films of yesteryear. This is more of a girly film than say <i>Shrek</i> or <i>Despicable Me</i>, but even my young nephew loved the story and didn't find it too mushy.\n\n</p>On the face of it it is a love story between two blue parrots being chased by smugglers. There is adventure, great landscapes, funny characters, and everything else the kids want. On a more subtle level it is a story about the dangers of animal smuggling, the importance of conservation, and it even manages to show the plight of the homeless children of Rio who feel pressure to steal so they can get money for food.  It is this combination of weighty social themes and a kids story that gives this film unexpected depth. My nephew asked me some difficult questions about homelessness and why some types of parrots are dying out but still loved the film, so it definitely put the seeds of curiosity in his mind. For that reason I award this film four stars.\n\n</p>Turning quickly to lighter matters, the 3D effects were very good as you would expect and the flying birds soaring across and out of the screen made a great impression. The film was very colourful and the songs did not overcrowd or detract from the story. The vocal cast included the aforementioned Jesse Eisenberg and Anne Hathaway alongside Leslie Mann (<i>Knocked Up</i>), Will-I-Am (Black Eyed Peas [Music]) and Jamie Foxx (<i>Due Date</i>). \n\n</p>I would strongly recommend this film for families with kids between 3-10 years old. It surprised me and my nephew loved it. \n\n</p>	9	2011-03-26	832	2011-03-26

Convincing Dr Knight to use his drugs could be the winning formula to get Jamie to the famous drugs conference in Chicago.\r\n</p><p>In a bid to impress Dr Knight, Jamie decides to shadow him to learn more about the world of medicine. This is how he comes to meet a beautiful patient, Maggie (Anne Hathaway - Rachel Gets Married). Jamie is intrigued by Maggie but the two don't hit it off straightaway.\r\n</p><p>Despite several rejections, Jamie is determined to get to know Maggie better. Maggie has other plans. She doesn't like to let anyone too close as she has a much bigger problem to deal with in her life that she doesn't want to impose on anyone else.\r\n</p><p>Hathaway puts in a strong and emotional performance as the sick girl who is torn between struggling alone and being loved. Gyllenhaal is suitably cast as the dashing love interest who has to prove his love for Maggie is real.\r\n</p><p>Love and Other Drugs is not a normal romantic comedy. The underlying story is actually very sad and this adds a different dimension to a movie of this genre. Fans of <i>Thank You for Smoking</i> and <i>50 First Dates</i> are sure to enjoy this film. </p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	797	2011-03-26
800	1	18	\N	The Next Three Days	<p>Adventurous Juno (Natalie Mendoza), school teacher Beth (Alex Reid) and happily married Sarah (Shauna Macdonald) are three friends out on a white water rafting holiday in Scotland when a secret is revealed to Beth and tragedy strikes changing one of the women's lives forever. A year passes and the three friends become six when they again meet up to tackle nature. The setting this time is the Appalachian Mountains in America and the challenge is to descend deep underground into a labyrinth network of tunnels and caves, a place where more than one type of danger lurks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Director Neil Marshall announced his arrival into the world of horror movies three years ago with the highly amusing blood soaked monster flick <i>Dog Soldiers</i>. The film became a cult favourite and Marshall has followed this early success with The Descent, a film that has ditched the humour in favour of old fashioned tension and claustrophobia. The result is the\r\nscariest and quite simply the best horror you will see this year.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>As a horror, the film is actually far more effective in raising scares during its slow burning first hour as the girls face up to the possibility of death thanks to the irresponsible actions of one of the team. The struggle is contested between the six women and the cave itself, an adversary more than capable of generating a thick atmosphere of menace on\r\nits own without the aid of the figures lurking in the shadows. Certainly the carefully crafted dynamics among the group and the suffocating atmosphere are abandoned in the last half an hour in favour of violent pickaxe action but to be honest this too is tremendous fun as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the faults that can levelled at the film could easily have been corrected with a slightly larger budget, such as the scenery around the cave entrance looking a lot more like Scotland than the Appalachians and some of the computer effects being a bit on the ropey side, but generally the ambitions of the film are realised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike many horror flicks, the film doesn't collapse into a giggle inducing mess as soon as the big bad monster makes its appearance on screen. Director Neil Marshall has obviously learned from his previous experience on fellow creature feature Dog Soldiers where his pack of werewolves were ever so slightly less convincing than Animal from the Muppets. The creepers that lurk in the dark recesses of this cave may not be the most ambitiously\r\ndesigned menace ever created but the make-up is convincing and their ghostly appearances, especially in the shocking first attack, is very effective in jolting the audience out of their seats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Girls running around caves being chased by monsters may sound like a depressingly familiar night out at the cinema but don't dismiss The Descent; the film really is very good not just in terms of horror flicks but movies generally, with plenty of moments to keep the audience asking questions.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Why is Juno acting so shiftily? Will Sarah be able to handle the pressure she faces in the cave? Is Beth going to spill the beans? Will the irritating Irish lass get crushed by a rock? Do the other two girls have personalities or are they just making up the numbers? You may be surprised to find out that, despite the fact that you are watching a horror film, you will\r\nactually care about the answers to these questions and more!</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	800	2011-03-26
801	1	16	\N	The Green Hornet	<p>The Green Hornet is a new comedy superhero movie based on the long running radio show of the same name and the brief but iconic TV series that introduced Bruce Lee to western audiences.\r\n</p><p>In recent years the standard wounded hero who dons spandex to fight crime and injustice has spawned so many films that it now has its genre. The stereotypes are getting a bit tired and many studios are trying to spice things up by tweaking the mix.\r\n</p><p>Recently the smash hit <i>'Kick Ass'</i> reinvented the franchise with a teen/comedy/hyper violence, <i>'Scott Pilgrim vs the World'</i> took the romantic/gamer geek/indie route, and even animated films like <i> 'Despicable Me'</i> and <i>'Megamind'</i> tried to tackle the genre from the villain's point of view. Behind this raft of comedy hero movies Seth Rogan now rocks up with The Green Hornet.\r\n</p><p>The thin story is that billionaire playboy Brett (Seth Rogan - Monsters vs Aliens), son of a media mogul, unexpectedly finds thrills by going out at night with his Kung Fu servant and tackling crime. The servant, Kato (Jay Chou - True Legend), is a genius at making gadgets and weapons and is a dab hand at kicking butt. Together they brand themselves The Green Hornet and the man in black. \r\n</p><p>Using his father's newspaper to gain publicity Brett builds the notoriety of The Green Hornet and his accomplice as new underworld leaders. The press coverage helps feed Brett's egotism and fuel his nocturnal fun. To help add credibility to their villain status, and to try and keep themselves alive, Brett and Kato take advice from sexy PA and criminologist Lenore (Cameron Diaz - Knight & Day) but as their fame grows it angers the true lord of LA crime Chudnofsky (Christoph Waltz - Inglorious Basterds).  Chudnofsky has quietly risen to the top of the underworld but his soft spoken voice and classic suits are less intimidating than the celeb Green Hornet and he is feeling threatened. \r\n</p><p>Despite a credible premise and some funny scenes this film never really ignites. The concept is sound but seems a little tame following 'Kick Ass' and Seth Rogan's dumb Brett becomes tiresome as it is painfully clear that shy mastermind Kato is the real star. The film tries to compensate for this by having the two leads row over who is the hero and who is the sidekick. That scene is quite funny and fans of the original 'Pink Panther' movies will definitely laugh. \r\n</p><p>Part of the problem may be that it just wasn't bold enough, and that the action was bogged down with connecting scenes that slowed the pace. The witty dialogue doesn't crack the whip and has quite a few predictable jokes. The film also wastes some great talent. Diaz is the dizzy but intelligent love interest who practically reprises her role from <i>Charlie's Angels</i>, less the hot pants and action; Tom Wilkinson is wasted as Brett's father seen in flashback and poor Edward James Olmos (Battlestar Gallactica [TV]) is given hardly anything to do.\r\n</p><p>Sadly this film does not really hit the mark. </p\r\n	2	2011-03-26	801	2011-03-26
805	1	16	\N	Legend of the Fist - The Return of Chen Zhen	<p>When I first heard about this film, I naturally assumed that it would\r\nbe a remake. After all, the fictional martial arts hero Chen Zhen has\r\nbeen the subject of numerous films and TV series' since his first\r\nouting in Fist of Fury (1972) and portrayed by martial arts superstars\r\nlike Bruce Lee (in the aforementioned Fist of Fury) and Jet Li in Fist\r\nof Legend (1994). Then I did some more research and found that Legend\r\nof the Fist follows on from the 1995 TV series (also starring Donnie\r\nYen) which ended in the same way as the original film. I can only\r\nliken this information to hearing that a new Butch Cassidy and the\r\nSundance Kid film is being made and that it will be a sequel.\r\n    </p><p>Putting aside plausibility concerns for one moment, the question on\r\neveryone's lips is whether this film features a sufficient amount of\r\narse-kicking. Emoting is quite frankly for the weak. A minimum of\r\nstory set-up and then some bare-knuckle violence is what I expect from\r\na good kung fu film and Legend of the Fist fails to deliver in an epic\r\nway. In fact, it fails to deliver on a whole heap of other fronts too.\r\n   </p><p> Set in Shanghai during the 1920s, we find Chen Zhen (Donnie Yen - Ip\r\nMan 2), armed with a fake tan and a stick-on moustache, working\r\nundercover due to his murder of a Japanese general prior to the war.\r\nHe ingratiates himself with a local nightclub owner Liu Yutian\r\n(Anthony Wong - Vengeance) and spies on the British, Chinese and\r\nJapanese clientele, all of whom have political clout in occupied\r\nShanghai. He also catches the eye of the club's best singer Kiki (Shu\r\nQi) and they begin a tentative relationship. Meanwhile, the Japanese\r\nare assassinating key intellectual, political and military figures in\r\nShanghai with the aim of weakening the country in preparation for\r\ntheir invasion.\r\n   </p><p>  Disguising himself with a black suit and mask, Chen Zhen\r\nattempts to prevent these killings, unleashing his kung fu skill on\r\nthe bad guys. However, even with the help of his WW1 comrades, can\r\nChen Zhen stop the nefarious plan of the Japanese and save China?\r\nFailing that, can he at least stop this particularly evil Japanese\r\ngeneral?\r\n</p><p>So that's the story. What's the film like? Well, I have to say that\r\nthere is so much wrong with this film it's hard to know where to\r\nstart. Generally speaking, the film makes horrible missteps all over\r\nthe place. The film is supposed to be serious and yet we still have a\r\ngroup of bumbling policemen to provide comedic relief. Chen Zen's\r\ndisguise looks like Kato's outfit from The Green Hornet, which I\r\nimagine everyone thought was a brilliant inclusion for the Bruce Lee\r\nfans but comes across as a cheap superhero costume. The Japanese bad\r\nguy has to be shown to be really evil to get the Chinese feeling all\r\npatriotic, so he's shown killing his underlings ("You have failed me\r\nfor the last time" - note that he doesn't actually say that, but I was\r\nthinking of Darth Vader during that particular scene) and hitting\r\nwomen. We discover a dark secret about Kiki far too early on, so we\r\nget a ridiculous amount of melodrama while Chen Zhen takes the\r\nremaining 90% of the film to work out what's going on because he's a\r\nbit dim.\r\n</p><p>Basically speaking, there are too many sub-plots crammed into the film\r\nthat go nowhere or have no emotional pay-off. This is mainly due to\r\ncharacter development being restricted to Chen Zhen, with the result\r\nthat his relationships with other characters lack depth. Shu Qi may\r\nlook beautiful but her acting is practically non-existent, and it's a\r\nsad day when even the great Anthony Wong cannot save a film.\r\nAs for the fights, the only way in which a paucity of fights would\r\nhave been acceptable was if the fights had been amazing and the plot\r\nsensible. To be fair, Legend of the Fist had a lot to live up to. Fist\r\nof Fury has the iconic scene of Bruce Lee armed with nunchucks taking\r\non an entire dojo of Japanese fighters, Fist of Legend ups the ante by\r\nfeaturing a fight every 20 minutes, with a finale where Jet Li takes\r\nout the sword-wielding bad guy armed only with a leather belt. It\r\nseems as if the fights get less intense as the film progresses which\r\nis clearly the wrong way to go about things, and even Donnie Yen's\r\nre-enactment of Bruce Lee's dojo fight comes across as a feeble homage\r\nthat is simply too little, too late.\r\n</p><p>Don't get me wrong. I like Donnie Yen. He's got a lot of skill as a\r\nmartial artist and has attempted to broaden kung fu fight choreography\r\nby including mixed martial arts moves in his contemporary films. His acting has also\r\nimproved considerably over the years and he does a good job here. I\r\njust think that he has been let down by a pig's ear of a plot that\r\nfeatured a lot of unnecessary sub-plots in a film that should either\r\nhave been a straight thriller, or a full-on kung fu film in the same\r\nvein as its predecessors.</p>\r\n	1	2011-03-26	805	2011-03-26
807	1	12	\N	The Tourist	<p>A mysterious woman Elise (Angelina Jolie - Salt) is under police surveillance in Paris. The authorities are keeping a close eye on her, hoping to catch a glimpse of her wanted love interest, Alexander Piers.\r\n</p><p>Through secret notes and messages, Alexander gives Elise instructions on where and when to meet him. Police inspector John Acheson (Paul Bettany - The Da Vinci Code) is hot on her heels and is looking for any opportunity to unmask the elusive Piers. Any male who talks to Elise is a potential suspect and the police are never too far away, ready to grab and question the suspects as they please.\r\nIn a bid to throw the police off the scent, Piers instructs Elise to board a train to Venice. He asks her to pick a man onboard the train who fits his description and to convince the police that he is in fact Piers.\r\n</p><p>Elise scours the train and picks tourist Frank (Johnny Depp - Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) as her substitute Piers. Maths teacher Frank is nave to what is happening around him and believes he is just lucky to have met a beautiful and mysterious woman on a train.\r\n</p><p>Trouble ensues and before he knows it Frank is being chased by men with guns, under orders by gangster Shaw (Steven Berkoff - Dead Cert) and soon after is arrested by the local police! Whatever next?\r\n</p><p>He is determined to clear his name and to find Elise to discover what is going on. Frank and Elise have grown closer and closer and despite Elise pushing him away Frank is even keener to pursue her.\r\n</p><p>Depp and Jolie don't conjure up the most convincing chemistry in this movie unfortunately.  Fans of Depp will probably be disappointed by this film as he isn't given the opportunity to shine in this role. Jolie is beautiful to look at but doesn't provide much else. Bettany adds some much needed humour to the mix while Berkoff is suitably evil as the villain.\r\n</p><p>The best thing about the movie is the beautiful setting of Venice. It will really make you want to visit! There are some good action sequences but I found the twist a little too predictable.\r\n</p><p>With elements of a Hitchcock thriller mixed with comedy, The Tourist is reminiscent of Strangers on a Train. </p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	807	2011-03-26

It is down to Rachel to sacrifice a life to save her son and to banish Samara forever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watts is suitably cast as the distraught mother but the lack of a storyline makes it difficult to grade her performance while Dorfman is pretty convincing as the disturbed son, even more frightening than the principal horror character herself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the return of the franchises' original director, Hideo Nakata, this film lacks tension or suspense and barely raises a pulse. The Ring 2 is a poor excuse for a horror and it pales into insignificance when compared to the last truly effective Japanese horror, The Grudge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Watch it on video if you dare (but don't waste good money to see it at the flicks).</p>\r\n	1	2011-03-26	140	2011-03-26
266	1	20	\N	Chicken Little	<p>On day a smart but lonely chicken was sitting beneath an oak tree when something struck him on the head. He looked up and around and could see nothing, then he noticed on the floor a small piece of the sky. In a panic he ran to the town's bell tower and rang the alarm. \r\n</p><p>\r\n<i>"The sky is falling, the sky is falling"</i>\r\n</p><p>\r\nPeople ran in fear and there was much confusion until the frightened townsfolk asked Chicken Little to show them the piece of sky that had fallen. He couldn't find it. They all searched and all that could be found was a small acorn. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe townsfolk were angry and they turned their back on poor Chicken Little. Even his own father, a former baseball champ, had difficulty believing the story, and at school Chicken Little gave his bullies the excuse they needed to torment him daily.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter a year, Chicken Little finally gets a chance to shed his reputation when he helps his baseball team win a decisive match. Then just as the celebrations are dying down and Chicken Little prepares for bed, the sky falls on his head once again.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThis time looking at the piece of sky with fresh eyes, Chicken Little and his friends learn that it is actually a tile from the underside of a flying saucer. The craft is seemingly invisible, and the aliens are octopus-like robotic machines that can vaporise anything in their path. \r\n</p><p>\r\nOnce again Chicken Little will raise the alarm and once again the town look on in disbelief. The craft is gone and poor Chicken Little's reputation is shredded. Luckily, the next morning fate smiles on Chicken Little when the sky really does shatter and hundreds of UFO's attack the town. Only Chicken Little knows what they want and only he can save them.\r\n</p><p>\r\nChicken Little is a fun and light hearted kids movie aimed at the younger children between four and ten. It's got loads of colourful and quirky characters and plenty of slapstick comedy and energetic action sequences. Also, like any good kids movie, it has a strong message for kids about telling the truth, standing up to bullies, and being brave enough to try something new.\r\n</p><p>\r\nLending their vocal skills to the crazy critters Zach Braff (Garden State) voices Chicken Little, Joan Cusack (Raising Helen) is his best friend Abby "Ugly Duckling" Mallard and Steve Zahn (Sahara) is "Runt of the Litter". This film has some great animation and is crammed with movie references. Maybe not as popular with the early teens as <i>Shrek</i>, but this is still a fun movie sure to delight the little ones.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	266	2011-03-26
818	1	18	\N	World Invasion - Battle LA	<p>The past few months have seen the cinema come under attack from different alien hoards. The romantic elephantine giants of 'Monsters', the brain munching menace from 'Skyline', and the coolest little dude ever 'Paul'. Now it is the turn for director Jonathan Liebesman (Texas Chainsaw - The Beginning) with Battle: Los Angeles. </p>\r\n \r\nSet in the very near future (aka the present), the film follows the movements of one squad of marines as they are recalled from basic training to help evacuate civilians from LA when aliens invade. The introductions are quite quick as the movie presses on with the invasion and before very long the marines are in the thick of the fighting. This quick plunge into action helps emphasise the speed of the alien invasion but it also leaves little time for us to learn anything about the cannon fodder before they start getting picked off by the elusive and highly resilient aliens.</p>\r\n \r\nLeading the squad is Aaron Eckhart (The Dark Knight) as damaged Sgt Michael Nantz. His briefly explored back story is that on his last tour of duty he made a decision that resulted in the death of most of his men. The decision had to be made but it still haunts him. Now back on the mainland responsible for training a new squad, he is preparing to retire. When the aliens arrive Nantz and his squad are assigned to a new 2nd Lt William Martinez (Ramon Rodriguez - Transformers 2) who is highly educated but has no real combat experience. Understandably the members of the squad are less than happy being lead into a hostile zone by a disgraced sergeant and a rookie lieutenant and it's not long before limbs start flying. This doubt in the men and the haunted past of Nantz are meant to provide a human drama against the backdrop of the invasion. To avoid this being a wiener fest the story also introduces a few scared civilians including veterinarian Bridget Moynahan (I, Robot), a crashed air force pilot (Michelle Rodriguez - Machete), a father (Michael Pena - Lions for Lambs) and his young son Hector (Bryce Cass - ER [TV]).</p>\r\n \r\nThe civilians unencumbered by macho camaraderie and bravado are allowed to acted frightened, shocked and thankful. Also it's handy having a vet with you when you need to perform a hasty examination of a dying alien to find weak spots. That leads us nicely to the aliens. Everyone wants to see the aliens when they see an alien movie and to be frank they do not appear up close for quite some time. Instead we see the alien's technology, a story element that becomes more pertinent towards the end of the film when the crisis point is reached. When you do see the aliens they are large amphibian creatures with lots of leathery skin and weapons grafted to their bodies. Think the predator but with a goldfish bowl for a head and you're getting close.</p>\r\n \r\nSo the film sets the scene quite quickly and then the rest of the film is the huddled group of soldiers and civies trapped behind enemy lines trying to find a safe retreat before the area gets flattened by heavy weight weaponry. You can probably guess that many will not survive and that those that do survive will get some form of catharsis for their various hang ups before the end.</p>\r\n \r\nAs a whole the film is good. The combat is close and claustrophobic, reminiscent of <i>Black Hawk Down</i> but the middle section does seem to drag. Also the hasty beginning doesn't allow the characters to cement an identity before the action kicks in. Unless of course there is some hidden message that the combat defines the character, as it appears to define Nantz, but I doubt that was the intention. One criticism I have, and this could just be me, is that I did not get a real sense of the scale of the conflict as the movie follows the one squad. The occasional glimpse of a news snippet tells us that the whole world is under attack but we don't see it. Even in LA we seem to focus on one squad when realistically you could imagine the fight would be on several fronts in that one city. If the story could flick between two squads and the command centre it would give an impression of mounting anarchy. True, that would probably sacrifice what little human drama there was but it'd really make for a great war film.</p>\r\n \r\nRounding up I'd say this was a great film and recommended for fans of shoot-em up computer games like <i>Command and Conquer</i>, and fans of films like <i>Black Hawk Down</i>, and <i>Aliens</i>. Not the best alien invasion movie ever but more realistic than the cheesy classic <i>Independence Day</i> and far better than its closest relation, <i>Skyline</i>.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	818	2011-03-26
822	1	1	\N	Sanctum	<p>Warning: despite James Cameron's name being plastered all over the adverts for this film, he was only the executive producer. A less tenuous connection between Cameron and this film is the use of the 3D filmmaking techniques that he's developed over the past decade and one of the men who helped in that work, Andrew Wright.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBased on Wright's real-life experience of leading a team of 15 people trapped in an Australian cave to safety, <i>Sanctum</i> is a film about a group of people who get trapped in a cave in Papua New Guinea etc etc. In other words, it's like <i>The Descent</i> but without the albino flesh-eating monsters and with more diving. \r\n</p><p>\r\nFrank (Richard Roxburgh - <i>Mission Impossible 2</i>, oh all right, he was in <i>League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</i> I hope you're happy now) is the highly capable expedition leader and the best man for the job but comes across as cold and unfeeling to people who don't know him well. Unfortunately, that covers most of the people who are relying on him: his teenage son Josh (Rhys Wakefield - <i>Home and Away [TV]</i>), his backer Carl (Ioan Gruffudd - <i>The Kid</i>) and Carl's girlfriend Victoria (Alice Parkinson - <I>The Pacific</i>). \r\n</p><p>\r\nSharing another plot aspect with <i>The Descent</i>, the survivors in <i>Sanctum</i> also get whittled down one by one (a fact which is signposted from the opening scene so don't complain about spoilers now), albeit in a fairly predictable order if not in predictable ways. Well, having said that, the first character who dies may as well have been wearing a redshirt and in fact I believe that the third character is actually wearing red. \r\n</p><p>\r\nFrankly this isn't exactly a film that's going to stretch your deductive skills. Unfortunately enough, the acting doesn't seem to be stretching anyone's skills either but hey, the guys are all well-muscled and you get to see a lot of tensed bicep muscles if that sort of thing floats your boat.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOn the filmmaking side of things, the 3D isn't strictly necessary but is used in an effective manner to provide a sense of depth (rather than the usual projectiles flying out of the screen).  The gorgeous scenery at the start of the film before we're warped into FilmSetLand is filmed so seductively that it's almost enough to convince even the most claustrophic person to give caving a go (especially if they're already seen <i>The Descent</i> and thought better of it). Unfortunately all of that natural beauty goes out of the window when the human drama kicks in.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOn the plus side, this film isn't another sequel or remake so I suppose one should be grateful for that tender mercy, but for all that this is strictly one for the caving/diving fans.\r\n</p>	2	2011-03-26	822	2011-03-26
823	1	1	\N	Age of the Dragons	<p>\r\nRyan Little's (Forever Strong) rubbish adaptation of <i>Moby Dick</i> falls short, way short of Herman Melville's literary classic. I'm sorry, have I pre-empted my opinion of this film? Got nothing to look forward to in this review? Well, thank me for saving you 94 minutes of your life.\r\n</p>\r\nI should start with the story line. Moby Dick is the ageless tale of one man's lifetime commitment to seeking vengeance which ultimately leads him to madness. In the book, and the original film version, starring Gregory Peck, Moby Dick was a whale, but in 2011 killer whales don't put bums on seats, so Little thought about giving Moby a makeover, and turn him into a dragon. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\nStill set in medieval times, the film has all the characters and charts the journey of Ishmael (Corey Sevier - A Flesh Offering) and his companion Queequeg (Kepa Kruse - Forever Strong) as they sign up to join the darkly interesting Captain Ahab (Danny Glover - Heart of Blackness), hoping to make their fortune by hunting for dragon oil that fuels the cities, but instead end up on this crazy man's quest for an elusive white dragon. As the story continues, we learn the mysterious story behind why Captain Ahab is so dark and brooding, and why he's obsessed with slaying this particular dragon. But one character not expected is Rachel (Sofia Pernas - The Immortal Voyage of Captain Drake), who instead of being the ship that rescues Ishmael at the end, ends up being a sexy sultry brunette who by medieval standards is impossibly flawless, well groomed and effortlessly stylish - I didn't know they had GHD in olden times. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\nNow being distinctly land based, the original ship, the Pequod, has had an overhaul as well, and where the characters were literally trapped with the insane Captain Ahab, the Pequod is now a weird wooden / metal ship-like construction, designed to travel on land where the crew can literally walk alongside (defeating the object of being trapped), but I guess it is helpful considering the cheap cardboard looking contraption that looks like it is hiding a couple of stagehands who are pushing it along. This tank monstrosity does very little to protect the crew from the dragons as every time they turn up, everyone gets off this "stank" (a new word I've just made up to describe this 'ship' and 'tank' vehicle, and also goes a long way to describe this film!) </p>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem is everything about this film is low budget. I don't begrudge shoe-string budget B-movies, I mean how great was the first <i>Saw</i> film? But this film gave the impression is was going to be a big budget epic fantasy with dragons, more like <i>LOTR</i>, so I was expecting a lot more. If only the chap who produced the trailer had directed the film, we might not have lost a couple of the audience members. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm afraid the acting was also laughably bad - even though the film isn't pegged as a comedy. The first guffaw came when the miscast Vinnie Jones (Magic Boys) as Stubbs walked onto the screen, and the last was when Glover's pantomime gruff voice sounded more like the voice you'd put on if you were calling the office trying to pull a sickie! </p>\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thing is you know what you're getting watching any film that stars Vinnie Jones, you're getting Vinnie Jones. Although he looks more at home in an urban gangster flick, he's not too bad in this movie but the low-budget of this film highlights the inadequacies of both him and the rest of the cast. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough a ridiculous notion, for the first hour, you are led to believe that Rachel is Ahab's daughter, until this is later cleared up, but with the poor CGI dragons, the quality of the cheap PVC costumes, and strange snowy no-mans-land countryside fresh out of a TV version of LOTR, it becomes quite believable that Glover's character has a white daughter. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for the romance, it was painful to watch, even between two hot cast members. In trying to highlight the deep and tortured nature of Ishmael and Rachel's relationship, the dialogue was humiliating and tiring, if not a little random - and the eventual kiss was gut wrenching - you have been warned, feel free to turn away. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it's not all negative. Its one saving grace was actually the younger casting, in the form of Pernas, Sevier and Kruse. They were so pretty to look at it and will keep both the male and female audience members happy. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\nIf attacks on and by CGI fire breathing dragons and shaky hand-held camera fight scenes is what entertains you, then this may just be the film for you; but leave your brain at home. If you liked Dungeons and Dragons and DragonHeart you might be in for a treat. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Age of the Dragons fails to live up to expectations, and could potentially win the Golden Raspberry Award this year. I'm sorry Vinnie, not one of my favourite films, please don't beat me up..... (Name, address and other identifying marks withheld!!!) </p>\r\n\r\n	1	2011-03-26	823	2011-03-26
824	1	20	\N	Oranges and Sunshine	<p>This almost documentary of a real life story directed by Jim Loach (Holby City [TV]) will truly tug at your heart strings and really left me wondering how on earth two governments could have brushed this story under the carpet for so long.</p>\r\n\r\nEmily Watson (Cemetery Junction) puts in a fantastic performance as Margaret Humphreys, a social worker from Nottingham who starts to unfold the mystery of hundreds of thousands of children from children's homes in the UK being put on to boats en masse, headed for Australia's shores. Some of the children were adopted in to families but it seems the majority were taken to children's homes with poor facilities and no better chance than they had in Britain. Margaret is the sole person who begins to uncover the mysterious happening of the past (although the last migrations happened as late as 1970). </p>\r\n\r\nThe core of the film tells us the story of just a handful of the thousands of children that were taken, some who still had blood relatives and even parents alive when they were sent away. Margaret, signed off with funding from her normal social worker duties, set about dedicating two years of her life to investigating the cases, making sacrifices and putting herself in more and more danger to carry on her work.  </p>\r\n\r\nThe stories of the migrated children are all harrowing and bitterly sad, with particularly good performances from David Wenham (Legend of the Guardians) who plays Len and Hugo Weaving (The Wolfman) as Jack. The individual stories really come to life but one wonders how many of the thousands of children had similar extreme experiences, of course hoping all the way that the majority haven't. </p>\r\n\r\nThis is a magnifying glass looking on to a huge intricate history. We couldn't hope to understand the impact the mass migration had on thousands and thousands of children and families. The film thankfully doesn't try and do that, but by telling the story of just a few, you begin to piece together the incredible effect this would have had on many generations of migrants to Australia. I can't help but think this story and its repercussions will not go away even though both governments (Australia in 2009 and the UK in 2010) have now apologised for the organised child migration schemes. Here is the statement that Gordon Brown issued on 24 February, 2010, while Oranges and Sunshine was in production: </p><i>\r\n\r\n"Until the late 1960s, successive UK governments had over a long period of time supported child migration schemes. To all those former child migrants and their families... we are truly sorry. They were let down. We are sorry they were allowed to be sent away at the time when they were most vulnerable. We are sorry that instead of caring for them, this country turned its back. We are sorry that the voices of these children were not always heard, their cries for help not always heeded. And we are sorry that it has taken so long for this important day to come and for the full unconditional apology that is justly deserved."</i></p>\r\n\r\nIf it weren't for the actions of Margaret Humphreys, so frank an apology from the government would have been highly unlikely. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n	9	2011-03-26	824	2011-03-26
825	1	4	\N	Submarine	<p>\r\n\r\nRichard Ayoade's (The IT Crowd [TV]) first venture in to screenwriting is a real triumph. Based on the novel by Jonathan Dunthorne (2008) this is a true British coming of age film, telling the story of 15 year old Oliver Tate who lives in a sleepy unspecified welsh town sometime in the 80s (These details really don't matter), with all the embarrassing hang ups and parents you could wish for. All the cast put in fantastic performances with a rousing, mulleted, psychic portrayed by Paddy Considine (The Bourne Ultimatum). You haven't seen him like this before. A sight to behold.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nCraig Roberts (Being Human [TV]) plays Oliver with Yasmin Paige (Murderland [TV]) playing Jordana, his arsonist, bullying love interest who somehow manages to portray Jordana so well you really like her, despite her not so attractive traits. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThere are some scenes that would make anyone cringe and relive the days of parent chats about first loves. I'm shuddering just thinking about it. Robert's fabulously low-key performance is absolutely key to this film being as successful as it is. Playing a character that you ultimately like, his imperfections are there for all to see, and laugh at (you know you have them too). Ayoade has found a real gem. We'll be seeing him again. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nTwo performances that could easily be overlooked are Oliver's parents. Fantastic casting brings Sally Hawkins (Never Let Me Go) and Noah Taylor (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) to play Mum and Dad. The characters aren't nearly as developed as Oliver and Jordana, but you see a glimpse of the people they are away from parenting and left wanting to see more.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nRefreshingly shot, subtly funny, touching and oh so British, for a debut feature, Ayoade has certainly pulled it out of the bag. There is no hint of pretention, or aiming to be something it is not. Just a small film, with great actors, telling a bittersweet story. Go on, support that British film industry and go see this great film.\r\n</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	825	2011-03-26
826	1	25	\N	Limitless	<p>The man of the moment Bradley Cooper (The A-Team) finally gets the chance to stand centre stage as the leading man in a film and prove to the studios that he has the star power to carry a film. So how did he fair?\r\nTwo stars may make you think that I am about to rip this film to shreds but I'm not. Honest, well, maybe a bit. </p>\r\nFor anyone who hasn't seen the trailer that tells you the whole movie, the film centres on a slacker, Eddie (Cooper), who is one day offered a miracle drug that transforms his life. The little clear tablet allows you to access and use the majority of your brain that is normally redundant.\r\nAfter Eddie takes the pill he feels super motivated and with the boosted brain power he starts to transform from layabout loser to ludicrously successful player. The drug helps him write a successful book and dabble in the stock market. With the new brain power comes a wave of confidence, women, money and a whole new lifestyle...while the pills last. </p>\r\nAs you can imagine the movie has to introduce a crisis and none is more obvious when dealing with drugs than the possible side effects, withdrawal symptoms, and violent drug dealers? Fortunately with brains as big as a whale's wardrobe you can normally think a way around these. </p>\r\nNow we hit the crux of the issue for me and the point where the stars bleed away from the rating score. The story simply doesn't know where to go. The steady rise to the top is entertaining and full of indulgent luxuries that many of us dream of but then when the plot needs to turn sinister it doesn't really feel like peril. </p>\r\nThe side effects are discussed but conveniently dismissed, you never doubt that the hero will outthink the bad guys and the final few twists are fairly limp. Basically I couldn't help but feel this movie made promises in the first half that the second could not keep. </p>\r\nAlso we have a moral problem to think about. As you know Hollywood doesn't like to make popcorn movies with unhappy endings. It won't ruin it for you to say that this film is no different. So then think about the content of the story and the message it portrays. Unintentionally this film portrays that if you experiment with drugs enough you may turn your life around, become rich and take over the world. </p>\r\nFortunately the 15 rating may allow some of the audience to think, pardon the pun, and remember all those educational videos at school about the perils of pills. </p>\r\nDid Cooper carry the film well? Yes, he proved he could keep the film afloat by standing centre stage. He has the look, the charm and the presence to keep the audience engaged even if the near cameo appearances of Robert De Niro (Little Fockers) offered some gravitas. The low rating is purely a reflection of this reviewer's doubts about the second half of the story. </p>\r\nThis film reminds me a little of <i>The Lawnmower Man</i> for the brain building science fiction, and maybe the odd element of <i>Wall Street</i> with the perils of quick fortunes and financial dabbling. Sadly it just isn't as good as either.</p>\r\n	9	2011-03-26	826	2011-03-26
827	1	27	\N	Source Code	<p>The tagline: <i>If you knew you only had eight minutes left to live, what would you do? </i>Well, for a start you can read this review - it could change your life, or at least persuade you that this is a really good sci-fi film that is a must see. </p>\r\n\r\nJumping into the action right from the opening credits, the second film from director Duncan Jones (Moon) keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. It takes a while to work out exactly what the Source Code is, but for now it's a bit like <i>Groundhog Day</i>, where Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal - Love and Other Drugs), a former helicopter pilot who has fought in the war in Afghanistan, keeps waking up on a Chicago commuter train in someone else's body. He finds himself sat opposite a beautiful 'stranger' in the form of Christina (Michelle Monaghan - Due Date), but after eight minutes the train is blown up and he jumps back into his own body. </p>\r\n\r\nStevens learns that he is part of operation Source Code of the movie title - that allows him to experience the last eight minutes of a schoolteacher who was killed when the train carriage he was riding in was destroyed by a terrorist bomb. He has little knowledge of what he's supposed to be doing or where he is, but each time he finds out a little more information, via his sympathetic handler, Carol Goodwin (Vera Farmiga - Henry's Crime). He must keep going back - his mission is to try and identify who the bomber is from those onboard the train. But he's got his own painful and confusing life to understand. </p>\r\n\r\nAlthough Stevens is told that his actions within the mission have no impact on the 'real' world, as the alternative reality he's thrown into is a shadow of the commuters last eight minutes, he still wrestles with his conscience. As the people on the train seem so real, he wants to try and save them, but back in the real world, they're all already dead. And the person he wants to save the most is Christina, who he's taken a shine to. </p>\r\n\r\nGyllenhaal was fantastically cast in this role, and the relationships and emotions that he felt and built were very real and believable. As the film revolves around his character he is able to accrue some serious depth, while Monaghan, although good, just had to sit there and look pretty. While back at the lab where Stevens is being held, Farmiga and her boss Dr Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright - Cadillac Records) basically play good cop/bad cop. </p>\r\n\r\nUsual Hollywood ending, I mean they could have had fun with this and made it a little grittier, but I'm not complaining, I thoroughly enjoyed this. It satisfied me both emotionally and intellectually. As my friend said at the end of the film "Out of five, I'd give this a sequel" - don't worry I gave him a look of disdain too! </p>\r\n\r\nIf you liked <i>Moon</i>, or dare I crassly mention <i>Groundhog Day</i>, then you'll definitely like this. \r\n	4	2011-03-26	827	2011-03-26
829	1	20	\N	Sucker Punch	<p>\r\nSucker Punch takes us on an epic adventure through the imagination of one young girl fighting against all the odds to survive. When Babydoll loses her mother and her only sister, she is locked away in an institution by her cruel stepfather, and the only way out is to band together with four other girls in an attempt to outwit Blue, the cruel and vicious man who runs Lennox House, and ensures that its residents do exactly as they are told. \r\n</p>\r\nDirected by Zack Snyder, whose previous efforts include <i>Watchmen</i> and <i>300</i>, it's fair to say that there are certain expectations of Sucker Punch, and the film does its best not to disappoint. A shame then, that sometimes its best is not quite good enough. \r\n</p>\r\nAs a spectacle full of intense action sequences, ably accompanied by a cocky pulsating soundtrack, it excels. However, as an attempt at telling a story, the film falls short on several counts. The emphasis is so strongly placed on the dream world created by lead character Babydoll (Emily Browning - The Uninvited) that the scenes in the real world suffer in comparison, often failing to keep the momentum of the story flowing. Weaknesses can also be found in the script, particularly for Babydoll, who never really convinces in her role as the leader of the group of desperate young girls. The repetitive nature of the action scenes, which basically amount to Babydoll and her crew facing off against one type of horde or another (robots, steam-punk Nazis, leftover Orc extras from LOTR) becomes tiresome by the end of the film, as does the advice of the girls' spiritual guide in the fantasy world, the Wise Man (Scott Glenn - The Right Stuff). \r\n</p>\r\nStill, there is plenty left to enjoy. The role of chief villain is superbly filled by Oscar Isaac (The Nativity Story) as Blue, a man so sadistic and twisted that after thirty seconds of his first appearance on screen it's impossible not to fantasise about and fervently hope for a potentially gruesome comeuppance. The rest of Babydoll's team of scantily-clad young things are far more convincing in their dual roles as ass-kicking deliverers of pain on the one hand, vulnerable and scared teenagers on the other. Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish - Bright Star)is particularly impressive as the older sister trying to look out for her sibling Rocket (Jena Malone - Into the Wild), and there is even an interesting turn from Vanessa Hudgens of <i>High School Musical</i> fame as the feisty Blondie.  Carla Gugino (Watchmen) also excels as Madam Gorski, the only person in Lennox House who tries to protect the girls under her care. \r\n</p>\r\nOverall, this is a film that leaves you with the impression that it could have been more than the sum of its parts. Some well-choreographed fight scenes and striking use of CGI keep the audience interested but far from hooked, and the last twenty minutes or so in particular seem a little rushed. Snyder's ambition should be lauded rather than criticised, yet in the end it is the delivery that counts. </p>\r\n\r\n	9	2011-03-26	829	2011-03-26
812	1	27	Blah	Paul	<p>Following the success of <i>Shaun of the Dead</i> and <I>Hot Fuzz</i>, comedy duo Nick Frost (The Boat That Rocked) and Simon Pegg (Star Trek) return to the big screen in another buddy movie with a difference. The zombies are gone, as are the murderous parish council. This time there is Paul, an alien. \r\n</p> \r\nTrapped on earth since the fifties Paul, a computer generated little green man with the laid back tones of Seth Rogan (The Green Hornet), has finally escaped from his confinement in Area 51 but has crashed his getaway car. On the run from the authorities Paul grabs a lift with two English geeks on a road trip (Pegg and Frost). You'd think that two science fiction fans would be thrilled to be the ones to rescue an extra-terrestrial. Truth is that they are nervous, scared and hideously out of their depth. Fortunately Paul is not only otherworldly with special abilities such as invisibility and healing; he is also wise and perceptive and helps the two friends overcome their limitations and become true heroes. Along the way the trio encounter racial, cultural and religious mishaps, vengeful rednecks, and relentless government agents. \r\n </p>\r\nSimilar to <i>Shaun of the Dead</i> and <I>Hot Fuzz</i>, this film is loaded with movie references. As our loyal readers know I am a massive geek and though I managed to spot countless clever jokes and references I am sure that I missed even more so as you can guess, I absolutely loved this film. Also I watched the film with my wife who didn't catch most of the references but still found the movie hilarious. So if the film appeals to both geeks and hottie wives with limited knowledge of science fiction then this is truly something special.\r\n </p>\r\nBefore this all sounds too gushy I am the first to admit that this film does lack something. Unlike their earlier movie collaborations, Frost and Pegg were no longer working with their good friend Edgar Wright who had to defer directorial duties as he was working on <i>Scott Pilgrim vs The World</i>. Wright's directorial and writing style is well suited to geeky English humour that propelled the earlier films and while Greg Mottola (Superbad) is no less a director with a great track record, something here is just a bit lacking. Some sections of the film seem to lack pace and the scope for some surreal camera work that could have added to the eeriness never really came off.\r\n </p>\r\nAll that aside this film, full of cameos and capers, has something that really does stand out and that is Paul. The computer generated alien central to the whole movie is excellently realised with convincing skin tone and the obligatory huge head with big round eyes. His body movement, facial expressions, and the excellent choice of Rogan combine to make possibly the best artificial actor since Andy Serkis brought Gollum to life.\r\n </p>\r\nThis film is recommended for fans of <I>Shaun of the Dead</i>, <I>Hot Fuzz</i>, <I>Galaxy Quest</i> and <I>Spaceballs</i>.\r\n	4	2011-03-26	812	2012-03-08
810	1	20	Blah	True Grit	<p>The story in this Western is very simple but belies a great movie. A loving father is murdered by a farm hand and his daughter, Mattie (Hailee Steinfeld), seeks both justice and vengeance. Leaving her ill educated mother and her young siblings, Mattie makes arrangements for her father's funeral before selling off his troop of ponies and using the money to hire a US marshall to track down the killer. In the dangerous days of the wild west Mattie is not willing to trust even a US marshall to do the job so she joins the hunt. Her doubts are easily justified as the US marshall in question is hardly the sociable sort. Rooster Coburn (Jeff Bridges - Tron Legacy) is a hard drinking remorseless killer with only one eye, a bad drawl and a dodgy arm. Not completely inspiring. Also on the quest is a sarcastic Texas Ranger, LaBoeuf (Matt Damon - The Informant), who is seeking the same man for a string of earlier crimes. \r\n </p>\r\nAs these three disparate characters head into the wilderness together we slowly learn a little more about their strengths. LaBoeuf is as relentless as Coburn but not as experienced. He tells grand stories of the achievements of the Texas Rangers and is constantly teased by the older more rugged Coburn. Battle scarred and gruff, Coburn has the appearance of an over the hill warrior too stubborn to quit and clearly no longer up to the task but it soon transpires there is hidden reserves of both courage and tenacity in his aching bones. By comparison young Mattie looks misplaced surrounded by lawmen and rifles but her wit is sharper than any Bowie knife and her persistence and maturity knocks both men back harder than the punches of any thug or bandit. \r\n </p>\r\nAll three characters have <i>True Grit</i> and as they get further away from security and the track becomes harder to follow, the loose thread of shared objectives begins to whither. The constant quipping between the two men, the harsh environment, the lack of food, all combine to tear the group apart. Can young Mattie pick which of the two heroes to follow? Will she get the justice she seeks?\r\n </p>\r\nSimilar to <i>The King's Speech</i> you can't help but think that this film was designed, prepared, cast and produced to win Oscars. Made by the Coen Brothers (No Country for Old Men), this film draws out excellent performances from the entire cast and blends it with beautiful cinematography and a slowly mounting tension. The bleak landscapes and the bleaker prospects for each character make for a downbeat but no less brilliant film. This is probably the best western I have seen since Unforgiven breathed new life into the genre. \r\n</p>\r\n </p>\r\n	5	2011-03-26	810	2012-03-08
820	1	18	"East is East and West is West and never the twain shall meet"	West is West	<p>Quote taken from Rudyard Kipling's poem "The Ballad of East and West"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sequel to the award winning East is East, in West is West we are again reunited with the infamous Khan family in Manchester in 1976.  This time the focus turns to the youngest of the six sons, troubled Sajid (no longer sporting the infamous parker) who is being bulled at school and struggling to cope with the racist remarks and tyrannical pressure from his dominating father to embrace his Pakistani roots.  Sajid feels lost, missing his older brothers who have moved out and with no friends at school, he begins to truant and shoplift which eventually leads to his arrest. </p>\r\nIn a desperate attempt to get Sajid back on track Mr Khan (Om Puri - Charlie Wilson's War) decides to take his son on a trip to his home in rural Pakistan to the wife (Mrs Khan Number 1 and her three daughters) whom he abandoned 30 years ago.    </p>\r\nThis is a coming of age film for both Sajid and Mr Kahn who are on a metaphorical journey of self discovery and forgiveness, learning to be comfortable with who they are and the choices they make.  </p>\r\nLike all good onions there are many layers to his film.  It explores the difficult father-son relationship dynamic often wrought with resentment and guilt. It explores cultural perceptions both from the European and Asian perspective and even explores the strength of women and their roles in society as mothers and as loyal wives. There are connections that everyone can relate to whether it be the difficulties of growing up feeling divided between two cultures or the beauty of friendship and the gift of forgiveness.  </p>\r\nThis film is an impressive debut for young Aqib Khan (Sajid).  Perhaps fated to play this role (as growing up he was often likened to the kid from East is East), he manages to portray the emotions of a young boy turning into a man really well, showing both the outer struggle with the adults around him and the inner struggle of his own conflicts of identity and cultural acceptance.  Despite all of this, he is also a cheeky Asian boy determined to find his brother Maneer (Emil Marwa - Zen [TV]) a good Pakistani wife.  As always Puri also delivers as Mr Khan, he clearly connects with the role and he stays true to the character he played almost 10 years earlier.  </p>\r\nUnlike other sequels, this film does work remarkably well as a standalone film.  There is very little reference to the first film and while a small appearance is made by Tariq (Jimi Mistry - The Guru) this film has more depth and colour than its predecessor.  </p>\r\nThere are some moments of real poignancy, in particular a scene involving the two Mrs Khans who, despite a language barrier, manage to communicate and reach an understanding of each other's predicaments and hardships as a result of Mr Khan's actions.  </p>\r\nWhile it may not be gritty or as comical as the first film, I enjoyed this film far more.  There is something more human about the emotions played out and the journey undertaken by all the characters.  A wonderful film largely down to a great script and equally great acting, with relevance to the world we live in today despite being set in the 1970s. This film will resonate with audiences everywhere regardless of race, background or cultural upbringing.   </p>\r\n \r\n	4	2011-03-26	820	2012-03-08
809	1	12	A dark, moody love story based on the best-selling Haruki Murakami novel	Norwegian Wood	<p>\r\nAdapted from the best-selling novel by Haruki Murakami, Norwegian Wood is a simple love story (albeit a mildly dark and depressing one), set in Tokyo during the late 60s, a time of civil unrest and student protests.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nWatanabe (Kenichi Matsuyama - Detroit Metal City) is drifting aimlessly through college in Tokyo, withdrawn ever since the suicide of his high-school friend Kizuki. By coincidence he meets Kizuki's girlfriend, Naoko (Rinko Kikuchi - The Brothers Bloom), and they start dating but neither one of them dares to mention Kizuki by name. After they consummate their relationship on Naoko's birthday, Naoko flees Tokyo the next day to check herself into a sanatorium.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nFeeling responsible for Naoko's emotional breakdown, Watanabe continues to keep in contact with her, but then he meets a confident, vivacious girl on his course called Midori (Kiko Mizuhara), seemingly Naoko's exact opposite. Torn between the two women, Watanabe must choose which one he will continue to see. Will he choose Naoko and the tragic past, or Midori and a bright future?\r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nConsidering that Japan regularly plumbs the depths of its novel, manga and anime markets for film and TV material, it is quite surprising that Murakami's most popular novel, having sold millions across the world since its first publication in 1987, hasn't made it to the big screen sooner. Part of that could simply be because some novels are simply too difficult to adapt for the cinema, and this could well be one such example.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nBeautifully filmed and acted, Norwegian Wood should work as a slow meditation on the themes of love, death and growing up, but unfortunately seems to tip over the precipice into overly dramatic navel-gazing that makes you want to slap the protagonists (all three of them) which clearly wasn't the intended effect.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nWith those themes in mind, it was perhaps going to be a difficult task from the outset, but it feels as if too much of Watanabe's internal musings about literature and some of his other, more metaphysical conversations with Naoko and Midori have been removed for the sake of streamlining the film. Without that additional content, what's left is simply Watanabe talking with Midori about sex and Watanabe talking with Naoko about sex and death, all of which rapidly become wearisome.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nWhile changes to the story make sense from a time perspective, I have to say that I'm baffled by some of the choices made regarding the film's soundtrack. The majority of scene transitions are accompanied by the previous scene's 60s pop track ending very abruptly, while some of the film's most dramatic moments are heralded by long strains of chromatic strings with occasional brass and woodwind blasts, something rather more suited to a horror film (see also Shutter Island).\r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nAside from that, the film is gorgeous to look at, with assured direction by Tran Anh Hung (an impressive feat considering that the director is Vietnamese and was entirely dependent on translators during filming) and superb acting from its three principal cast members. Newcomer Kiko Mizuhara provides an impressive debut performance, embodying both cute and sexy, but the film rests on the shoulders of Rinko Kikuchi and Kenichi Matsuyama and both are excellent as always.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nIt's been a long time since I read the book so I don't feel entirely qualified to pass judgement on how worthy an adaptation Tran Anh Hung has achieved. If you're a big fan of the book then I think you'll get something out of this (dodgy soundtrack issues aside), but for everyone else I think you would be better off watching Love Story for your depressing love fix.\r\n</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	809	2012-03-10
808	1	12	Disney's animated stealth musical is surprisingly good fare	Tangled	<p>Not wishing to accuse Disney of misleading its followers, but I distinctly remember watching the trailer for Tangled a few months ago back in the UK and not catching any whiff of a musical. So when Rapunzel bursts into a song and dance number within the first 15 minutes or so, I was rather shocked (it wasn't a bad song per se but more on that later). So anyway, for those of you who prefer their animations to be pure, and not akin to some bastard offspring of opera and play (as an old school friend used to dismissively refer to musicals), this probably isn't for you.\r\n\r\n</p><p>If you're still reading, then at this point some form of plot summary is in order. Staying reasonably true to the original tale, Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore - Grey's Anatomy [TV]) is a beautiful girl with improbably long blonde hair, imprisoned in a remote tower by the witch Gothel. In this variation however, Rapunzel is also a princess who was kidnapped by Gothel for her magical hair. With a song from Rapunzel, it rejuvenates those who touch it but the hair is only magical so long as it remains uncut.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Enter the handsome prince, or rather the roguish thief Flynn Rider (voiced by Zachary Levi - Chuck [TV]), on the run from the royal guards after having stolen the lost princess's tiara. Chased by a determined and slightly mad horse, Flynn stumbles upon Rapunzel's tower where she clobbers him senseless and hides his satchel and tiara. She promises to return them to him if he'll take her to where the lanterns are released, the ones she sees from her tower window every year on her birthday. Hijinks ensue.\r\n\r\n</p><p>The rest of the plot is entirely predictable and yet still a great deal of fun. Flynn and Rapunzel bond during their travels, encountering a motley crew of cut-throats with their own unfulfilled dreams, as well as those persistent royal guards and Maximus the bloodhound-like horse. There is of course a crisis, instigated by that dastardly Gothel, and eventually reconciliation and marriage. Huzzah!\r\n\r\n</p><p>The supporting cast add little in the way of depth, but a lot in the way of entertainment. The cut-throats have their own brilliant song and then get to save the day, plus there's the usual anthropomorphised side-kicks in the form of Rapunzel's wise chameleon, Pascal, and Flynn's nemesis, Maximus, who very nearly steals the film. My only complaint would be that Gothel could have come across as a more rounded character if only her constant putdowns of Rapunzel had been left out - as a result she garners no sympathy from the audience but then that is all well and good for a villain.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Tangled takes a classic fairy tale, puts a modern spin on it, tarts it up with some stellar animation and rounds it all off with a collection of decent songs. There's little to fault and the film plays enough merry havoc with the original that it can't be accused of translating verbatim from word to screen. Highly recommended for all the family, well apart from those musical-hating curmudgeons but you can leave them at home where they belong.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	808	2012-03-13

Don't get me wrong, it's still a good crowd tickler but it didn't have me in stitches like some other comedies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nicole Kidman is cute and vulnerable as the wannabe little Miss nobody while Ferrell was his usual energetic mix of insanity and stupidity. The effects were good and the sight gags were well choreographed but the package felt a little too contrived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original concept of making a gag out of Hollywood's constant desire to make lesser remakes of classic TV shows introduces a dose of irony as this is indeed a lesser remake of a classic TV show. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a simple popcorn movie that may crack a smile and lift a weary heart.

As Aeon finds out why, she realises she can no longer complete her mission and Sithandra is sent in to the finish the job off for her.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMeanwhile, Trevor is overthrown by his own government and his brother Oren (Johnny Lee Miller - Melinda and Melinda) betrays him for befriending a Monican and turning his back on the government's plan.\r\n</p><p>\r\nTheron is mysterious and sexy as the sultry assassin, wearing either a tight black jumpsuit (think Catwoman/Underworld) or hardly any clothes at all.  Sure to be a hit with the male viewers. \r\n</p><p>\r\nCsokas is one for the ladies as the suave and sophisticated chairman and the chemistry between him and Theron is convincing but yet cannot save the film alone.</p><p>\r\n\r\nAeon Flux contained some good fight scenes and action stunts but failed to ignite any excitement due to the sheer lack of originality with the plot.  It's strangely reminiscent of 2005's The Island, both films sharing a similar plot and lack of excitement or action.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	189	2011-03-26
194	1	15	\N	Kicking & Screaming	<p>This film would score at least a 4 out of 5 if an extra 10-15 minutes of script/film had been added. Co-written by James Marsh and Milo Addica (Monsters Ball, The King is striking and shocking. However, what it lacks is depth and background to the reasons behind Elvis Sandow's (Gael Garcia Bernal) actions. Though slight revelations to Elvis' background are made throughout the film these are non-revelatory and lack substance. Elvis' history is not painted early on and what results is a film that wanders from the sweet and sensual to the brutal and bloody, leaving the audience throughout with more questions than answers.\r\n</p><p>\r\nStrong, if not outstanding, performances are displayed throughout by the four lead characters: Elvis Sandow (Gael Garcia Bernal - Bad Education), Pastor David Sandow (William Hurt - A History of Violence), Malerie Sandow (Pell James - Uptown Girls) and Paul Sandow (Paul Dano - Taking Lives), it is a pity they are let down by the omissions within the script. Perhaps the strong influences of religion, the story of Cain and Abel and the theme of redemption play a part in this omission, what can't be forgotten however are the strong musical talents of Pell James and the twinkly eyes/bewitching smile of Gael Garcia Bernal. \r\n</p><p>\r\nUnless you are a budding actor, wait for the DVD release and with it a Director's Cut that hopefully will fill the gaps presented in its cinematic release.\r\n</p>	1	2011-03-26	194	2011-03-26
195	1	16	\N	The Perfect Man	<p>Hilary Duff follows up the trauma of a teenager's love life in 'A Cinderella Story' with yet another soppy romance, 'The Perfect Man.' </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Duff plays Holly, a girl who is always on the move and who doesn't have a place to call home.  Her mother's tragic track record with boyfriends has hindered Holly and her sister Zoe (Aria Wallace), in making new friends.  Holly's only friend these days seems to be her laptop and weblog. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holly's mum, Jean (Heather Locklear - Spin City [TV]) is desperate to give her daughters the stability they need so she moves the family to the Big Apple in the hope of starting afresh (again). But Jean's bad luck with men seems to follow her everywhere and soon Holly realises that it is time for her to intervene. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with her new found friend, Amy (Vanessa Lengies) and Amy's uncle, Ben (Chris Noth - Sex in the City [TV]), Holly starts to research what the perfect man would be like. Then with the help of her artistic friend Adam (Ben Feldman), Holly conjures up an imaginary secret admirer to make her mother believe there really is a soul mate out there. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>After plenty of meddling, lying and some truly damaging pranks, Holly discovers her matchmaking antics have spiralled out of control.  Not only will she end up hurting her mum but she has also been blind to the fact that she has jeopardised her own love life in the process. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hilary Duff is typecast again as the troubled teenager with a passion for internet matchmaking.  It would be a nice change to see her tackle a completely new role to see if she is up to the challenge.  Locklear makes a comeback to the big screen with an emotional performance after concentrating more on TV work of late. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Locklear and Duff's characters share several similar traits throughout the film such as sporting identical hairstyles and wearing the same jewellery, as well as having to adopt the other's persona in the film.  I can only assume these similarities were put in the film to highlight the close bond between the two characters and to exemplify their impersonations of each other as genuine and realistic.  A mention must also be given to Noth (aka Mr Big) who put in a charming performance as the apparent love interest. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Perfect Man is a feel-good movie with some heartfelt scenes, perfect for teenage girls and mothers alike.  Watch it if you liked A Cinderella Story, Jersey Girl or Sleepless in Seattle.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	195	2011-03-26
209	1	16	\N	The Man	<p>Meet Agent Derrick Vann (Samuel L Jackson - Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith), you could be forgiven for mistaking him for detective Axel Foley from Beverly Hills Cop.  They both share the same careless and selfish 'I can work without a partner' mindset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In crime busting, Vann knows who to get the inside info from, how to talk the talk with the bad guys and when to do the bust.  He doesn't want, need or trust anyone - he works alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until...meet innocent family man Andy (Eugene Levy - American Wedding) who is visiting Vann's Detroit turf to give a speech on dental sales. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>Unbeknown to Andy, he gets caught up in Vann's sting operation with arm's dealer Joey (Luke Goss - Cold and Dark).  From then on, Andy is involved and gets dragged deeper and deeper into the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vann isn't the most caring of cops; in fact he is quick tempered, prone to shouting profanities and he has no qualms about being overly violent.  So when Vann tells Andy what his next move is to be, Andy simply does it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the case of mistaken identity and despite the fact that Andy looks as innocent as a nun, Joey and his gang believe he is a tough businessman and brand him 'The Turk'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After several meetings with Joey to set up the deal, Andy soon starts to get a taste for his new role and takes matters into his own hands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To Vann's disbelief, the role reversal puts Andy in charge and Vann can only sit back and play along with the situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With his lieutenant and Internal Affairs breathing down his neck, Vann can't afford to blow the case.  He will do anything to make sure Andy doesn't leave until the job is done.</p>  \r\n\r\n<p>Samuel L Jackson gives a good performance as the bad-ass cop who refuses to take any crap.  Levy is also on top form as the blithering chatterbox salesman who sets up the big laughs in the film.  Goss is starting to make a name for himself as the bad guy in almost all of his big screen roles and does a mediocre job in this film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For all the big names concerned, The Man is purely a CV padder.  It is an average film that will add to the actors' portfolio if it's a success and do nothing to harm their already established careers if it turns out to be a flop.  I'm sure director Les Mayfield grabbed these two big stars to help him get back into the game after a dry spell of directing with his last films being American Outlaws (2001) and Blue Streak (1999).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you enjoyed Man of the House or Analyze This, go see this movie.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	209	2011-03-26
216	1	16	\N	Flightplan	<p>Jodie Foster (Panic Room) returns as yet another panic stricken and unstable character in Flightplan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foster plays Kyle Pratt, a widow whose husband tragically and unexpectedly dies in Germany. She is on her way to the US, with her daughter Julia (Marlene Lawston) in tow, to transport his body back home. But as with most of Foster's films, her character is plagued by bad luck and mysterious circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flying home on a deluxe super aircraft with fantastic propulsion, designed by Kyle herself, she wakes several hours after take-off to find her daughter missing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After searching through all the seats, aisles and luggage lockers, Kyle begins to panic and starts making a scene by demanding to see the captain. The distraught mother will stop at nothing to find her daughter. She has no qualms about apportioning blame to innocent passengers or accusing the crew of not doing a good job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what Kyle refuses to believe is that no-one on the plane ever remembers seeing Julia onboard and there is no record of her on the passenger manifest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the entire plane thinking she is delusional and an air marshall keeping a watchful eye over her, Kyle is determined to uncover the truth and find out what has happened to Julia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foster is typecast in numerous nervy, panicky and unstable roles so she suits this movie perfectly. Credit must also go to Sean Bean (National Treasure) who performs well as the tough and sceptical captain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flightplan offers more than it reveals in the trailer. There is a hidden twist, which many failed to predict, so this movie should keep you guessing. A great thriller and a must-see for fans of mysterious thrillers like <i>The Forgotten</i>, <i>Ransom</i> or <i>Executive Decision</i>.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	216	2011-03-26
219	1	16	\N	Elizabethtown	<p>Drew Baylor (Orlando Bloom - Kingdom of Heaven) was at the top of his game, the brains behind the perfect shoe.  But one day his dreams fell apart and the shoe he had spent so long designing flopped and lost his company billions of dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the verge of suicide, Drew is determined to be free of all his recent troubles and failures but a phone call from his sister Heather (Judy Greer - Cursed) puts a stop to his sudden downfall.  Drew hears that his father has died and that he must return to the family hometown of Elizabethtown to bring his father's body back to his mother and sister in Oregon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite feeling worthless, Drew takes on a new lease of life and for once feels he has a purpose and a responsibility to his family.  On his way to the funeral, Drew meets air hostess Claire (Kirsten Dunst - Wimbledon) who helps him to see a whole other side to his existence.  In Claire he finds a friend and companion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drew struggles at first to connect with his father's side of the Baylor family because of the distance and time between them.  Claire helps him to get through the difficult period and even though the pair are not romantically involved they often act like a loving couple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No one character stands out in this film due to the lack of depth and connection between the audience and the characters.  Bloom and Dunst put in solid performances individually but there is no real depth or insight in to their respective characters and there is a lack of spark and chemistry between the two leads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Director Cameron Crowe is highly regarded in America for making classy and smart movies ranging from romantic drama <i>'Jerry Maguire'</i>, the rockumentary <i>'Almost Famous'</i> and the abstract <i>'Vanilla Sky'</i>. Of these <i>'Vanilla Sky'</i> was a remake that Cameron and company acknowledged, however, despite <i>Elizabethtown</i> being a near complete rip off of last year's <i>'Garden State'</i>, the press information makes no mention of Zach Braff's earlier directorial debut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are slight differences in the movie but the basic thread is almost identical. A mid twenties semi-successful male returns to the family home to try and reassemble his fractured life and falls in love with a quirky girl who shows him there is more to life. He makes peace with his family and moves on. Pull it together Cameron, we know you are a good director and can make great movies so why make such an obvious rehash!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elizabethtown fails to offer anything new to the saturated romantic drama genre.  The characters are not particularly engaging and the plot is hardly original, mostly being compared to the recent <i>Garden State</i>.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	219	2011-03-26
225	1	15	\N	Saw II	<p>The story of one man's foot and its close relationship with a hacksaw turned out to be the horror success of 2004 and its creators, led by writer Leigh Whannell, have managed to write and produce a sequel in just one year. <b>Saw II</b> sees the Jigsaw killer still at large and still punishing those he considers to be wasting their lives. The police are closing in, but before they can catch their man the Jigsaw has trapped eight potential victims in a house that is slowly filling up with poison gas. They only have two hours to live but if they are prepared to fight for survival they might just make it out alive.</p> \r\n \r\n<p>While the original <i>Saw</i> didn't exactly have a host of big names in its cast, it did at least have recognisable actors such as Cary Elwes and Danny Glover in lead roles. In Saw II the audience must make do with Donnie Wahlberg (Band of Brothers [TV]) and Dina Meyer (Starship Troopers). The famous faces are not the only thing in short supply when compared to the original, the sequel seems to have a smaller budget and the scope of the film has shrunk as well. Much of the action takes place within just two locations, Jigsaw's lair and the house his victims are trapped in. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Frankly this leaner approach is one of the film's strengths. It dispenses with the original's frequent diversions to witness the deaths of Jigsaw's other victims, victims who had no relevance to the central plot, and instead puts a bunch of unfortunates together in a house of traps and horrors. This central plot is actually very reminiscent of Cube, a superior little horror film that deserved a wider audience. Nevertheless, Saw II is competently acted by all involved, maintains a good level of tension and comes up with a couple of nice set pieces where the killer's victims must prove to him how much they really want to live.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Perhaps the only disappointing aspect was considering the rather sick pedigree this sequel had to live up to I was actually expecting the walls to be drenched in blood. Not nearly enough people are horribly killed in this film, in fact one victim gets to die by slumping into unconsciousness after being overcome by the toxic gas. Since when was coughing someone to death considered a good day's work by a bunch of horror filmmakers who even managed to get the film's poster of two severed fingers censored for being too graphic?</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Undoubtedly Whannell is already planning a third film in his horror franchise considering this film's conclusion and also its success at the American box office. If this is the case then perhaps I could make a request at this early stage; next time spend a bit more of the budget on the red stuff.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	225	2011-03-26
229	1	16	\N	The Exorcism of Emily Rose	<p>The Exorcism of Emily Rose documents the real-life trial of Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson - Batman Begins) who was accused of negligent homicide resulting in the death of college student Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter - White Chicks).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Advertised as being based on a true story, the case of Emily Rose is said to be the first demonic possession to be officially recognised by the Catholic Church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emily Rose, a young girl from an impoverished background, won a much-needed college scholarship and left her family in search of a good education. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>One fateful night in her dorm when she was all alone Emily had an unnatural experience which led her to be hospitalised.  She was diagnosed as a schizophrenic psychotic and put on drugs from then onwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what Emily was experiencing was not typical of a schizophrenic or a psychotic patient.  She returned home as her behaviour deteriorated.  After bouts of odd behaviour, her family called local parish priest Father Moore to intervene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After speaking to Emily, Father Moore believed she may have been possessed by a demon and went on to perform an exorcism in a bid to save her life.  But the exorcism failed and soon after Emily died.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Father Moore was put on trial accused of negligent homicide.  Acting as his defence lawyer, Erin (Laura Linney - Love Actually) set out to clear his name and to present the argument that Emily was not medically ill but was in fact possessed.  The prosecuting lawyer, Ethan (Campbell Scott - Duma), on the other hand, was hell bent on proving that Emily was simply a sick girl who failed to take medical advice and that Father Moore contributed to her death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wilkinson and Linney put in tremendous emotional performances as the accused and his defence lawyer, who not only have to fight their own inner demons but also the outer evil spirits lurking around them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Exorcism of Emily Rose, unlike other horrors centred on demonic possession, does not rely on cheap scares and jumpy moments.  Its credit lies in its content and serious court scenes while exploring a scary concept of the supernatural world.  Watch it if you enjoyed The Exorcist, Constantine and Stigmata but don't expect many scares, although the concept it is based on is terrifying in itself.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	229	2011-03-26

Sadly due to a tragic accident \r\nElizabeth doesn't make it to the date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then we meet David Abbott (Mark Ruffalo - 13 going on 30) who moves into Elizabeth's \r\nformer apartment.

David confides \r\nin his psychologist friend Jack (Donal Logue - Confidence) who is sure David has gone \r\nmad and is hallucinating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>David tries everything to get Elizabeth out of his apartment.  Finally he meets \r\nDarryl (Jon Heder - Napoleon Dynamite), a spaced out spiritual geek, who gives him\r\n a few wise words on the spirit he is seeing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Will David succeed in driving Elizabeth out of his new home or will he succumb to \r\nher wishes of helping her find out what happened to her?  Watch the movie to find out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ruffalo is the real star of the show and sparkles above Witherspoon in the truly \r\nemotional scenes by putting in a heartfelt performance.  He also has the most \r\nhumorous scenes, along with back-up one liners from Logue and Heder. Witherspoon, \r\nsweet and sincere as ever, lends a good support as the troubled spirit but does \r\nlittle to change her established stereotype as a goody know-it-all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the best romantic comedy of the year so far, true it's only January but \r\nit's a good start. Take your date to watch this movie as it's sure to please and \r\nis a good all rounder. Recommended for fans of <i>"All of Me"</i>, <i>"Ghost"</i> or <i>"13 going on 30"</i>.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	230	2011-03-26

Not only does Frank want to save Jack's life but he is also trying to clear his name of any involvement with the kidnap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately for Frank, this is no simple kidnap case.  Sure, the bad guys, led by Gianni (Alessandro Gassman) and sexy sidekick Lola (Kate Nauta), are after a huge ransom from Mr Billings (Matthew Modine - Le Divorce) but they have an even more menacing plan up their sleeves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Statham performs well as the hard man ex-agent and convincingly pulled of his own stunts in the movie, thanks to his background in boxing and martial arts.  He also gets to enjoy a thrilling high-speed car chase in a Black Audi A8.  His nemesis in the film, played by Gassman, puts in a satisfactory but not very memorable performance as the bad guy, Gianni.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transporter 2 provides some great fighting and car chase sequences in a mindless action movie, thought to be much better than its 2002 predecessor.  Watch it if you enjoy 'hardly any plot but great action and fight scene' movies such as <i>XXX2</i>.</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	234	2011-03-26

255	1	7	\N	Brokeback Mountain	<p>Adapted from Pulitzer Prize winning author Annie Proulx's short story, Brokeback Mountain is an understated epic love story from the ever-versatile Academy Award winning director Ang Lee.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe summer of 1963 sees ranch hand Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger - The Brothers Grimm) and rodeo rider Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal - Jarhead) working together tending sheep on Brokeback Mountain, Wyoming. In the months of solitude their relationship unexpectedly evolves from friendship into a deeper intimacy. They both return to their chosen reality of settling down with wives and children until they meet four years later and find that their feelings for each other have not changed.  The film follows them as they struggle with their forbidden love; juxtaposing their stifled family lives with the open wilderness of their reunions on Brokeback Mountain. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWith a haunting original score by Gustavo Santaolalla and sweeping cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto, the excellent central performances by Ledger and Gyllenhaal are intensely moving. The only thing to distract from the measured dialogue is the use of the ever more ridiculous hairstyles of the female supporting cast to mark the passage of time. \r\n</p><p>\r\nFilmed around Alberta in the Canadian Rockies with a well-adapted screenplay by Larry McMurty and Diana Ossana, Ang Lee has produced a beautiful, thoughtful film.

Tsotsi (literal translation 'Thug') was adapted and directed by Gavin Hood from the novel by playwright Athol Fugard. Originally set in 1950's Johannesburg, South Africa this film is set in the present for both financial and ease of relating in a post-apartheid life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tsotsi (Presley Chweneyagae) is the leader of a small-time criminal group of four: Aap (Kenneth Nkosi), a slow-witted sheep, Boston (Mothusi Magano), who dreamed of being a teacher and Butcher (Zenzo Ngqobe) a murderous creep. The start of the film paints a grim picture as Tsotsi and his group of heavies are taunted by a more upscale heavy villain and his troops for their lack of status and stature in the criminal world.  This encounter proves to be the tip of the iceberg as the film descends into threatening behaviour, blood and death to what eventually appears to be Tsotsi's epiphany; the stealing of a car and the unwanted kidnapping of a young baby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is with the stark realisation of time, attention, and responsibility that this young baby brings, that flashbacks to Tsotsi's own childhood are brought to the forefront. An AIDS orphan whose father abused him, Tsotsi survived sleeping in the orphan hive of stacked drainpipes outside the township, through the repression of his childhood memories and his own sheer force of will. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through a series of mishaps involving newspaper nappies, condensed milk and ants, the young baby appeals to Tsotsi's paternal instincts and eventually to a fellow shantytown dweller Miriam (Terry Pheto). Miriam is followed home one afternoon by Tsotsi, held at gunpoint and forced to feed the baby while Tsotsi watches on. This is no one-off and soon a bond between baby and surrogate mother is made and with it the softening of Tsotsi's steely eyes and persona. Eventually a bond building between surrogate mother and surrogate father through their common care and love of the baby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though the film lacks real depth in its insight into Tsotsi's past, a strong performance by Presley Chweneyagae carries the film throughout. His piercing eyes offset by his 'childlike' face are carried further by his subtle characterisation through a story told at a steady pace. It would have been easy for Tsotsi to end in the violence that introduces the film, however instead we are left with far more emotional and lasting images of Tsotsi shaking, face streaming with tears as he returns the baby to its parents and ultimately its mother.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	283	2011-03-26

Fanning, as usual, steals the show with a very grown up and serious performance, almost an adult trapped in a child's body. Hounsou fails to put a menacing edge on his character but nevertheless is always a joy to watch while Belle is simply the eye candy for the male viewers.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nPush offers an interesting take on the saturated mutant/super power genre with a grittier and edgier feel. Almost a cross between X-Men and Jason Bourne.\r\n</p><p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	284	2011-03-26
293	1	16	\N	Take The Lead	<p>\r\nA suave and sophisticated dance teacher Pierre Dulaine (Antonio Banderas - The Legend of Zorro) teaches ballroom dancing to rich kids and upper class competition hopefuls.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOne day on his way back from class, Pierre's eyes are opened to the real world of crime and suffering in downtown New York when he witnesses a couple of teenagers trashing a teacher's car.\r\n</p><p>\r\nPierre realises he can offer his skills to these troubled kids so he pays a visit to the headmistress in question, Augustine (Alfre Woodard - Desperate Housewives [TV]).  Pierre volunteers to supervise the kids on detention as long as he can give them ballroom dance lessons.  Augustine reluctantly agrees to let him take on the troubled teens since no other teacher can seem to get through to them.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe kids in detention are either suffering from bad home lives or are struggling to deal with personal problems linked to drugs, violence or crime.  Most of the kids like Rock (Rob Brown - Coach Carter) and Larhette (Yaya DaCosta - America's Next Top Model [TV]) are good kids at heart and are just trying to get themselves through school to ensure they can lead a better life.\r\n</p><p>\r\nPierre sees the potential in these kids and is determined to teach them the meaning of respect through ballroom dancing.  At first his students are strongly resistant to change and aren't interested in Pierre's fancy footwork and old timer melodies.  This all changes when Pierre introduces them to one of his protgs Morgan (Katya Virshilas - Smallville [TV]) who shows them just how sexy ballroom dance can be.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe students change their tune and agree to listen to Pierre who wants them all to enter a ballroom dance competition once they complete their training.  When the students hear about the prize money up for grabs, they agree to take part.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe class start to get into the mood and the rhythm and even spice up the dance routines with a touch of hip hop street dancing mixed in.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWill the detention kids wow the judges at the competition or will the uptight rich kids reign supreme?  Watch to find out.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBanderas performs well as the suave and sophisticated dance tutor and his Spanish roots are evident from his impressive moves on the dance floor.  Other notable performances come from Virshilas who is a trained ballroom dancer in real life.  Praise must also go to Jenna Dewan (Joey [TV]) as sexy Sasha who is a terrific dancer along with Dante Basco (Biker Boyz) as Ramos who was also hot on the dance floor.  These two are part of one of the sexiest dance routines of the movie.\r\n</p><p>\r\nTake the Lead is a must-see for fans of dance shows like <i>Strictly Come Dancing</i> or <i>Strictly Dance Fever</i>.  If you liked <i>Honey</i> and <i>Save the Last Dance</i>, go see this movie.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	293	2011-03-26

306	1	14	\N	The Devil and Daniel Johnston	<p>As a reclusive teenager and with the use of Super-8 films and expressive comic book drawings Daniel showed unusual artistic ability. His disapproving fundamentalist Christian parents led to a short spell with a carnival in Austin, Texas and with it the development of his musical career. Through his own endeavour, a brief spotlight on MTV ensued and thus he began to make a local name for himself. However with-it Daniel's inner demons surfaced, leading to manic depression, a life marked with wild fluctuations and delusions of grandeur.\r\n</p><p> \r\nLong considered as the ideal subject for a documentary feature it took director Jeff Feuerzeig and producer Henry S. Rosenthal to bring the idea to life. Unravelling the persona of Daniel Johnston: songwriter, musician, performer, painter, cartoonist, manic-depressive and visionary. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe Devil and Daniel Johnston gives an insiders view to the enigma and living breathing folk legend through a mish-mash of video clips from interviews with friends and family, to recordings of stage performances. Through clever editing, audio and visually all facets of Daniel mania, his life story and the beauty of his art and music is captured. Throughout Daniel's voice is unmistakable. His spittle-ridden lines, whether talking or singing, tell a whole story of their own and were made with the hundreds of audio and video cassettes that Daniel recorded of his entire life. Every key moment and emotion he could possibly experience was captured and presented in this film displaying Daniel's essence and innocence in all its naked glory.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	306	2011-03-26
307	1	14	\N	Fateless	<p>Marking the directorial debut of the distinguished cinematographer Lajos Koltai, this is a film adaptation of the 2002 Nobel prize winning author Imre Kertesz's book Sorstalansg, 1975 (Fateless, 1992). \r\n</p><p> \r\nA semi-autobiographical novel about the Holocaust, Fateless tells the story of the coming of age of lead Gyorgy Koves as he passes through several camps, including Auschwitz and Buchenwald. Beginning as a wide eyed teenager in Budapest, Hungary, Gyorgy's life appears to be no different from that of any other 14-year-old boy: family politics, his love of the girl next door and school. However the clear yellow star is an indication of the repressed life he and his family and friends live.\r\n</p><p> \r\nArrested one day and taken to a concentration camp, the young Gyorgy conforms and survives. The alienating reality of the concentration camps, the limited food and exhausting slave labour reducing Gyorgy's personality to nothing but a number, the dynamism of totalitarianism.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFilmed throughout with what appears to be a coffee filter, there is nothing warm or soothing about this film. However, this is, both emotionally and visually, a beautiful film. A film about the holocaust that is beautiful? Disconcerting, but yes. Throughout one can only feel empathy with Gyorgy's life and his capacity to come to terms with his surroundings.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	307	2011-03-26

Directed by Michael Gondry (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind), this is both a showcase for David Chapelle's crowd pleasing talents to that of the numerous rap/hip hop and RnB stars that litter this film.\r\n </p><p>\r\nOrganising a free block party to the residents of Brooklyn, Chappelle invites friends, acquaintances and random passer bys in his home town of Ohio. Laying on transportation and accommodation, a diverse crowd of both race and age are brought together to witness what is undoubtedly a visual, musical and humorous showcase of talent.\r\n</p><p> \r\nCreativity, improvisation and originality are in abundance throughout, both from the musicians to the in-film audience, what lowers the quality however is Chappelle's crass use of words ("NIGGER"), jokes ("MEXICAN") and stereotypes ("GAY") that result in isolating the diverse mix within the on watching crowd.\r\n</p><p>\r\nChappelle could do well to listen to the advice given to Ohio's Central State University by Wyclef Jean (the Fugees). "Don't blame the white folk, there are libraries in the hood". A simple statement that brings to light Chappelle's failings, both in the social responsibility that comes with being an icon and also in his choice of material to score cheap laughter.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	334	2011-03-26
386	1	17	Illicit relationships, strained marriages and repetitive robberies come together	Breaking and Entering	<p>Don't let the catch line "Love is no ordinary crime" trick you into thinking this is a rom com. Despite the fact that you get to see Jude Law (Alfie) without his shirt on, this movie is more about how hard relationships are when people are too busy to connect with each other.</p>\r\n<p>Jude Law plays Will, a London-based architect whose marriage to Liv (Robin Wright - Max) is crumbling as a result of the constant care required by their exuberant yet autistic daughter Beatrice. Liv, who is depressed, cannot open herself up to her husband and feels frustrated because he is too wrapped up in his work to understand what she is going through.</p>\r\n<p>The plot focuses around events that unfold when Will's office is broken into by a group of Bosnian boys with amazing gymnastic abilities who steal all the computers in the office - twice! The main thief is a young boy called Miro (Rafi Gavron) whose uncle runs a black market for stolen computers. When Will follows Miro home to his mother Amira (Juliette Binoche ñ Bee Season), instead of telling her about her son's nightly meanderings into locked offices, he embarks on a passionate affair with her.</p>\r\n<p>When her son confesses to his crime, Amira is caught in a bind as she is aware that breaking off the affair could lead Will to prosecute her son. Watch as the film takes unexpected (if slightly clichÈd) turns of fate, which leads Jude Law's character into the arms of the right woman for him.</p>\r\n<p>The heavy baseline of the film is kept buoyant by quirky subplots such as Will's business partner's romantic obsession with the cleaning lady. In fact, perhaps the most memorable character in the film is an\r\nEastern European prostitute who keeps them company during the stakeouts.</p>\r\n<p>This is not a film for a rainy day. It is, however, an interesting piece of work that skillfully delves into relationships and the choices people make.</p>	4	2011-03-26	386	2012-03-08
348	1	16	\N	Trust the Man	<p>Meet Agent Derrick Vann (Samuel L Jackson - Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith), you could be forgiven for mistaking him for detective Axel Foley from Beverly Hills Cop.  They both share the same careless and selfish 'I can work without a partner' mindset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In crime busting, Vann knows who to get the inside info from, how to talk the talk with the bad guys and when to do the bust.  He doesn't want, need or trust anyone - he works alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until...meet innocent family man Andy (Eugene Levy - American Wedding) who is visiting Vann's Detroit turf to give a speech on dental sales. </p> \r\n\r\n<p>Unbeknown to Andy, he gets caught up in Vann's sting operation with arm's dealer Joey (Luke Goss - Cold and Dark).  From then on, Andy is involved and gets dragged deeper and deeper into the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vann isn't the most caring of cops; in fact he is quick tempered, prone to shouting profanities and he has no qualms about being overly violent.  So when Vann tells Andy what his next move is to be, Andy simply does it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the case of mistaken identity and despite the fact that Andy looks as innocent as a nun, Joey and his gang believe he is a tough businessman and brand him 'The Turk'.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After several meetings with Joey to set up the deal, Andy soon starts to get a taste for his new role and takes matters into his own hands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To Vann's disbelief, the role reversal puts Andy in charge and Vann can only sit back and play along with the situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With his lieutenant and Internal Affairs breathing down his neck, Vann can't afford to blow the case.  He will do anything to make sure Andy doesn't leave until the job is done.</p>  \r\n\r\n<p>Samuel L Jackson gives a good performance as the bad-ass cop who refuses to take any crap.  Levy is also on top form as the blithering chatterbox salesman who sets up the big laughs in the film.  Goss is starting to make a name for himself as the bad guy in almost all of his big screen roles and does a mediocre job in this film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For all the big names concerned, The Man is purely a CV padder.  It is an average film that will add to the actors' portfolio if it's a success and do nothing to harm their already established careers if it turns out to be a flop.  I'm sure director Les Mayfield grabbed these two big stars to help him get back into the game after a dry spell of directing with his last films being American Outlaws (2001) and Blue Streak (1999).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you enjoyed Man of the House or Analyze This, go see this movie.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	348	2011-03-26

So when an opportunity arises to work on 'Runway' magazine, Andy jumps at the chance. She doesn't mind that she will be a PA, she just hopes it will open more opportunities for her in the world of publishing.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWhat Andy fails to realise is that she is applying for a job to work alongside the most fashionable, highly regarded, and immensely demanding editor Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep - The Manchurian Candidate).\r\n</p><p>\r\nAndy's first faux pas is turning up to her interview unprepared and looking very 'everyday'. Despite her poor first impression, Miranda decides to give Andy a shot, much to the amazement and chagrin of her current PA, the fashionable and efficient Emily (Emily Blunt - My Summer of Love).\r\n</p><p>\r\nThings start off extremely rocky and Andy struggles to keep up with the fast pace and demanding routine of her job. She fails to gain any respect among her peers by refusing to conform to the standard norm of looking anorexic, chic and fabulous.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter a particularly demanding day she turns to fellow colleague and minion designer Nigel (Stanley Tucci - Lucky Number Slevin) for help and he willingly gives Andy a complete makeover to help her fit in.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWith her new clothes and appearance comes a whole new outlook, attitude and confidence. Soon Andy is fully integrated into the Runway family and she even finds herself mimicking her colleagues.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAndy embraces every single demand and challenge that Miranda throws at her and she becomes a trusted member of the team but at a high price. Andy starts to become a different person; she becomes accustomed to schmoozing with the rich and handsome media types while her loyal boyfriend sits at home alone and she loses contact with her real friends. \r\n</p><p>\r\nStreep is suitably cast as the ice cold bitch while at the start Hathaway cowers beneath her as the dowdy and intimidated new girl. Emily is great in her supporting role as the tough non-nonsense English snob who bosses Andy around.

A young student nurse, Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar - Scooby Doo 2) is called to the house to care for an elderly lady, Emma (Grace Zabriskie - Gone in 60 Seconds) following the mysterious disappearance of her former helper, Yoko.</p>\r\n<p>As soon as Karen enters the house she becomes embroiled in the evil that is lurking there. Instead of giving in to the curse, she sets out to discover the truth of what lies within the house.</p>\r\n<p>The story does not follow the normal route of storytelling but jumps from the present to the past to explain all aspects of the story in an unconventional yet effect way. This allows us to learn a little about what happened to Emma's absent family and also provide clues to the dark past of this troubled property.</p>\r\n<p>With only a minimal number of American cast members, namely the ever popular Gellar, Bill Pullman (Lost Highway) and Jason Behr (Roswell High[TV]), The Grudge manages to retain its roots as an original Japanese horror. The story ois engaging and full of suspense and will keep you on the edge of your seat.</p>\r\n<p>Fans of The Ring looking for more heart stopping scenes and sinister figures should look no further. If you thought the black-haired girl in The Ring was scary, you aint seen nothing yet. Be prepared.</p>\r\n	9	2011-03-26	376	2011-03-26

411	1	15	\N	The Pursuit of Happyness	<p>\r\nFor Chris Gardner (Will Smith - Hitch) life is a struggle. While his wife Linda (Thandie Newton - Crash) works double shifts and his son sits in day care, Chris tries to sell medical equipment that he has spent his life savings on. It isn't proving as popular as he had hoped. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhile scouring the city for sales, he spots a man pulling up to an office block in a flash sports car and Chris asks him what he does for a living. Satisfied with the answer, and noticing that everyone else working in this street are also beaming with smiles, Chris resolves to become a stockbroker too. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAs his wife takes off leaving Chris to bring up their son alone, he signs up to an unpaid six-month internship with a one in twenty shot at a stock broking job at the end of it. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe film's title, The Pursuit of Happyness, comes from the incorrectly spelt name of young Christopher Gardner's nursery. The pursuit of happiness also happens to be one of the inalienable rights of Americans as written in The Declaration of Independence. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSadly the implicit suggestion that becoming a stockbroker will make you happy is the kind of life lesson that will only sit comfortably with the most cutthroat of capitalists. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe film's principal strength lies in the quality of the acting from its leading man. The always charismatic Will Smith is excellent as Chris. The character is a more demanding role than the usual action heroes that Smith plays but should an Oscar nomination come his way in the next month he will have well deserved it. His real son Jaden also proves to be a chip off the old block playing his on screen son Christopher, suggesting he may have won the role as much through his precocious talent as simply having his dad as star and executive producer. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhile Chris as a character is genuinely admirable enough to sustain the audiences' sympathies, his story never feels remarkable enough to justify a whole film on the subject. While his situation is desperate, his struggle to succeed is not extraordinary. There is a sprinkling of comedy in a film that desperately needs its lighter moments. Much of the amusement revolves around the Bone Density Scanners that Chris sells to make an honest living. Each small victory, however, is met with a succession of setbacks and disappointments. \r\n</p><p>\r\nBy the time Gardner has lost his money, accommodation and wife the film becomes a real slog. Don't be fooled into thinking that The Pursuit of Happyness is an uplifting experience. The eventual result of Chris' internship comes too late and is too low key to alleviate the overwhelming feelings of despair the audience has been wallowing in.\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	411	2011-03-26
422	1	20	\N	Epic Movie	<p>\r\nI love movies, hence the website, and I think that some films may take themselves a bit too seriously but nothing justifies the punishment that many a great movie suffers at the hands of the (hardly) creative team behind 'Epic Movie'.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nThis year's victims to endure a thrashing include <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i>, <i>Nacho Libre</i>, <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>, <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i>, <i>Snakes on a Plane</i>, <i>The X Men</i>, <i>Superman Returns</i>, and the <i>Harry Potter</i> movies.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nOnce again blockbuster movies are given the special 'comedy' treatment. Basically the writers get the scripts for some memorable scenes, take a dump on them, erase any intelligence and then hand it to a team of young funny starlets to try and act.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe only really commendable things in this movie are the set, design and costume. The artistic team have at times gone to great lengths to recreate similar sets and scenery from the victim movies.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nOn the acting front, if it can be called that, Kal Penn (Harold & Kumar) makes a return to parody after recent stabs at serious acting in TV's 24 and Superman.  Similarly Hector Jimenez (Nacho Libre) manages to generate some good laughs as a wannabe 'Mr Tumnus'.  Seems ironic that the filmmakers managed to nab some of the actors from the movies they are ripping to pieces! Finally mention must be made of 'Milf' (Jennifer Coolidge - American Dreamz) who puts in a good pantomime-esque turn as the white bitch.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAll in the film had some good gags and some impressive sets but was woefully bad. I am sure it'll generate plenty of laughs and enough cash to fund the next massacre of movies but will not linger long in the halls of comedy brilliance.\r\n</p>	1	2011-03-26	422	2011-03-26
433	1	15	\N	The Return	<p>\r\nThrowing your viewer in at the deep end with absolutely no exposition or explanation is a refreshing but risky move by the filmmakers behind The Return. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe success of this chiller relies purely on generating enough mystery to maintain the audiences' attention so they don't notice the absence of plot. Unfortunately compelling stuff this is not. The revelation that is eventually uncovered is as mundane as murders get, but frankly it does come as something of a relief that there was a point to the proceedings after all. The narrative spends so long fumbling in the dark without any obvious progress it certainly tests the patience of the audience. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe story kicks off with a curious fairground incident where a young girl cuts herself while hiding from a sinister figure she spots lurking by the carousel. Jumping forward in time, the girl, Joanna (Sarah Michelle Geller - The Grudge), is now twenty-five and works as a sales woman who spends her life on the road. She has been avoiding her home state of Texas for years but business now demands her return. \r\n</p><p>\r\nComing back home, however, has its downsides; Joanna is quickly plagued by hallucinations of places she has never been and of a menacing figure stalking her. Seeking out the locations from her visions, Joanna makes the acquaintance of Terry (Peter O'Brien), a man who may have a connection to the death of a young woman in the area years before. \r\n</p><p>\r\nGeller doesn't exactly command your attention as Joanna. Almost all the role demands of her is to wander around rural Texas in a trance, something she achieves by staring off in to the middle distance with a glazed expression on her face. Only by tackling meatier roles than this will Geller discover whether she can turn a successful career in television into similar acclaim on film. \r\n</p><p>\r\nWhile the film's pace and narrative leave plenty to be desired, director Asif Kapadia contributes a certain atmosphere to the proceedings. The decaying locations have plenty of character and commendably the film creates menace and suspense in its daylight scenes. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe Return shouldn't be confused with a predictable Hollywood horror despite the advertising that has accompanied its release that suggests otherwise. Those who do take a chance on it will likely find it too abstract for its own good. Unsettling camera work and moody lighting are no compensation for interesting characters and a gripping plot.\r\n</p>	2	2011-03-26	433	2011-03-26

He begins his life at the Golden Wonton Restaurant where he is raised by crazy China man Mr Wong (Murphy).\r\n</p><p>\r\nNorbit (Murphy) grows up to be a geeky kid with a good nature.  He doesn't have many friends but he strikes up a close relationship with fellow orphan Kate.  The two are inseparable and spend every minute together.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBut one day the friends are parted when Kate gets adopted by a foster family and leaves the orphanage.  Norbit is left to fend for himself.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFast forward a few years and Norbit is a geeky teenager being bullied at school.  A huge entity comes to his rescue in the form of Rasputia (Murphy).  Little does Norbit know but Rasputia is soon to become his girlfriend and future wife.\r\n</p><p>\r\nRasputia is larger than life and everyone who comes across her and her three hefty brothers quivers with fear.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSoon Norbit is part of the family but he is trapped because as soon as he puts a foot wrong or upsets Rasputia his life will be over.\r\n</p><p>\r\nJust when Norbit thought his life could not get worse, a glimmer of light appears.  The beautiful Kate (Thandie Newton - The Pursuit of Happyness) returns home.  Kate and Norbit rekindle their childhood friendship and start spending more and more time together to the disgust of Rasputia and Kate's fianc.\r\n</p><p>\r\nNeither couple is happy but greed, deceit and jealousy all stand in the way of Norbit and Kate's happiness.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMurphy dons three personas in his latest movie as Chinese Mr Wong, monstrous Rasputia and puny Norbit.  He returns to his silly humour phase in films such as <i>The Nutty Professor</i> and <i>Dr Doolittle</i>.  Newton is suitably pretty and slim as Rasputia's nemesis in a change of role since her more serious performances in Crash.\r\n</p><p>\r\nNorbit is an entertaining comedy with no expectation so sit back, relax and embrace the stupidity.  Fans of <i>The Nutty Professor</i> and <i>Road Trip</i> are sure to love this movie.\r\n</p>	9	2011-03-26	435	2011-03-26

Though slight revelations to Elvis' background are made throughout the film these are non-revelatory and lack substance.

445	1	23	\N	Straightheads	<p>\r\nRespected documentary filmmaker Dan Reed's second feature Straightheads is a revenge thriller heavy on shocking violence but light on well-developed characters. Considering director Reed's reputation is built on shooting real-life, it's surprising that Straightheads' central relationship feels hollow and unrealistic. \r\n</p><p>\r\nYou can buy Gillian Anderson's (The Last King of Scotland) London career girl Alice picking up Danny Dyer's (Severance) much younger Adam for a night of debauchery in the country. But, after events go a bit <i>'Straw Dogs'</i> at the hands of some inhospitable locals, the bond that develops doesn't convince. There isn't enough character building to care about how the two deal with their physical and mental scars. They are automatons in an overly familiar revenge plot structure, rather than real people dealing with a traumatic event. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThat's not to say that Straightheads doesn't have effective moments. The violence is suitably shocking and mixed with moments of bleak humour. Dan Reed's style is sparse, with chilling silences and long shots. The most horrific events happen off-screen or in the distance, letting their appalling nature dwell in the mind. But, it's not enough if there isn't a character to care about. Maybe he needs to take a glance back at his documentaries to see how real people behave.\r\n</p>	2	2011-03-26	445	2011-03-26

Lessons include starting fights and learning to manipulate people.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe lessons go well and soon Roger is the star of the class but this new popularity has a down side. Dr P hates competition and soon sets out to destroy his star pupil and win the heart of Amanda for himself. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThere is no trick too low for these two warring males as each tries to win Amanda and ruin the other. Angry tennis, parking tickets, prank love letters and even a spray painted dog make an appearance as the battle plays out.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe comedy timing is perfect as the two leads lock horns but considering they compete over a lady, the romantic interest is actually quite weak and feels like an excuse for the insanity rather than the cause. Maybe she should attend the class herself?\r\n</p><p>\r\nThis is a fun filled comedy that generates some good laughs but sadly doesn't push the ticket hard enough. There is never a doubt who will win in this war of wit and, despite some great performances, the film needed more laughs.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThis film is recommended for couples on a date and fans of light romantic comedies such as <i>'Anger Management'</i> and <i>'Meet the Parents'</i>. \r\n</p>	2	2011-03-26	452	2011-03-26
461	1	15	\N	Vacancy	<p>Snuff movie thriller Vacancy seems to have been copied straight out of the big book of Hollywood clichs. Bickering couple Amy (Kate Beckinsale - Underworld) and David (Luke Wilson - Old School) are lost among the back roads of rural America after David takes an ill advised shortcut off the freeway. \r\n</p><p>\r\nA near collision with a careless rodent damages their car and the pair are forced to stop at a motel and service station that comes complete with an untrustworthy mechanic and a manager cut straight from the same template as Norman Bates. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAs the couple try to settle down to sleep in their shabby motel room David decides to unwind in front of the television and discovers several videotapes depicting strangers being brutally murdered. Aghast David realises the footage has been shot in the very same room they are spending the night in. \r\n</p><p>\r\nTheir rest stop becomes a fight for survival as the couple barricade themselves in their room while masked figures wielding knives stalk in the shadows and the manager taunts them from outside.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWhile everything about Vacancy's plot is familiar and predictable, actor Luke Wilson's laconic style makes a welcome change from the usual hysterics and screaming. In fact this horror thriller's saving grace is that its two stars for once actually deserve their billing. Beckinsale puts in a typically irritating performance but at least for once it's intentional and considering the genre she's in, her acting is a step up from what audiences are usually subjected to. Wilson, meanwhile, while not necessarily fully committed to the part, is still as watchable as ever. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe downside, however, of not casting the usual bunch of teenage unknowns is that the stars' high profile status smothers any chance that something unexpected might occur to their characters and as a result Vacancy turns out to be a very pedestrian film devoid of all tension. \r\n</p>	2	2011-03-26	461	2011-03-26
475	1	23	\N	The Flying Scotsman	<p>\r\nCycling is far from the most cinematic of sports. Tiny crowds watching scrawny, lycra-clad men wearing bizarre, phallic helmets go round and round a track doesn't, on the face of it, quite have the Rocky factor. But yet The Flying Scotsman manages to stay true to the sport's low-key reality, while giving us a sense of the exhaustion, speed and exhilaration at its core. \r\n</p><p>\r\nJonny Lee Miller (Aeon Flux) is excellent in the central role as Graeme Obree, the emotionally fragile amateur cyclist whose performances on a home-made bike broke records and new ground. He depicts Obree - who was on set for much of the shoot - as an outsider frantically attempting to out-peddle mental demons. But, however fast or far he goes, he can't quite escape their shadow. He's awkward, stubborn and geeky, but also likeable. Whether he's leaving bullies in his wake in a flashback sequence or railing against the cycling establishment over his custom-made bike and innovative cycling positions, you're with him all the way. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThrow in fine supporting performances from Billy Boyd (LOTR) as his manager and Laura Fraser (Land of the Blind) as his long-suffering wife with unfussy, efficient direction from Douglas Mackinnon, and you have an unusual and moving sports film and character study.\r\n</p>	4	2011-03-26	475	2011-03-26
477	1	23	\N	Seraphim Falls	<p>\r\nThe crack of a gunshot through the mountain silence sets in motion a relentless game of cat and mouse in this tense western. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSeraphim Falls has an outstanding opening half an hour, in which Pierce Brosnan's (The Matador) Gideon is suddenly shot as he lights a fire by a group of men who mean to end his life for reasons unbeknown to the viewer or him. There is little dialogue or music as Gideon frantically tries to evade his attackers down snow covered hills and waterfalls, while trying to stop his shoulder bleeding and avoid freezing to death. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe strength of this opening is that no background information is given as Liam Neeson's (Breakfast on Pluto) Carver and a band of guns for hire pursue their prey. The opening is so pacy and tense director David Von Ancken doesn't allow emotional sympathies to align with either party. \r\n</p><p>\r\nNatural instinct leads to an identifying with the pursued Gideon, but then what has he done to make Carver go to such lengths to want him dead? \r\n</p><p>\r\nBoth leads deliver majestic performances as men who have been shaped by the arbitrary violence of post civil war America. When the revelation finally comes as to how their two destinies have become intertwined, the scene is visceral and moving, without being overblown. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSeraphim Falls does tail off when the chase dynamic runs out of steam. Also, the ending dallies dangerously with pretension with a surreal cameo from Angelica Huston (Material Girls) missing the mark. But, this beautifully shot and performed take on America in transition does enough in its set-up to make it a gripping watch.\r\n</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	477	2011-03-26

481	1	23	Lamb's not on the menu in bloody Black Sheep	Black Sheep	<p>Sharks, rats, alligators, gorillas, piranhas, snakes.... when it comes to members of the animal kingdom that have been cast in the role of cinematic villainy, the list is expansive. But sheep? \r\n</p><p>\r\nA more unlikely murderous mammal hasn't been seen since a cuddly bunny went for the jugular in Monty Python's The Holy Grail. But, one thing that Kiwi-creature-feature Black Sheep does well is to make its ovine-flesh eaters into entertaining and occasionally terrifying adversaries to the film's bonehead human characters. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSome of The Thing meets Babe effects in this low budget New Zealand located horror are excellent, particularly when people start mutating into sheep/human hybrids.\r\n</p><p>\r\nHowever the good work from the effects department is totally undone by poor scripting, clichd characters and a weak storyline. \r\n</p><p>\r\nBlack Sheep's plot, for what it's worth, focuses on Henry Oldfield (Nathan Meister), a city boy who returns to the family farm to confront his childhood demons and sell his share to his repellent older bother Angus (Peter Feeney). Little does he know that Angus is tampering with sheep DNA - a little too intimately in one of the film's funnier moments - in an effort to create a new breed. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAside from the totally predictable plot, writer/director Jonathan King's debut feature is butchered by risible acting and weak dialogue. None of the cast particularly excels themselves, but Danielle Mason is particularly irritating as the drippy-hippy animal protestor Experience. The name says it all really. This heinously unfunny, karma-platitude babbling, scented candle waving stereotype kills every scene she's in.\r\n</p><p>\r\nJonathan King's clearly going for that amateurish yet inventive <i>Evil Dead</i> or <i>Braindead</i> feel, but totally undercooks matters.

518	1	22	\N	Mr Magoriums Wonder Emporium	<p>\r\nThe story is set in Mr Magorium's Wonder Emporium, a magical toy shop owned by the very eccentric 243-year-old Mr Magorium (Dustin Hoffman - Stranger Than Fiction). Mr Magorium decides it is his time to leave the shop and depart this world leaving it all to his assistant Molly Mahoney (Natalie Portman - V for Vendetta). Before he does this he needs to enlist an accountant to tidy up the books, preferably a non believer or sceptic of the magic that takes place in the shop. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe movie follows the story of how when Mr Magorium leaves the store it feels upset, turns dark, and is no longer alive.  Because Molly Mahoney does not believe she has what it takes to look after the store it won't come back to life. With the help of Henry Weston, the accountant, and a little boy called Eric she learns to believe in herself and doing so helps to bring the store back to life.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nDustin Hoffman was very good as Mr Magorium with the maddest eyebrows ever, which the kids found thoroughly amusing. He came across as very eccentric, just like a magical man would look and behave. Natalie Portman as Molly Mahoney was delightful and very believable both in her magical role and when she doubts herself. Jason Bateman (The Kingdom) as Henry Weston is a stereotypical accountant, suited and booted, and not at all encompassing the idea that the Wonder Emporium is a magical toy shop quite literally. He plays this role well and grows into the film more as it goes on.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nMy kids (aged six and eight) and I enjoyed the film. It kept the children's attention well. They loved the fun bits in the Emporium when funny things happened and everything came to life. As an adult the storyline was good and you had something to follow. Both of my children at their age understood the meaning of the film that if you believe in yourself enough you can do anything that you would wish to. This is a good lesson for children to learn and was shown in a fun way. Aside from the comedy and fun, the more emotional scenes were dealt with sensitively.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThe film is reminiscent of the latest version of <i>'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i>, certainly with the darker aspects to it in some scenes and the lessons it teaches. However, I did feel that it could have had more of the toys in the Emporium actually interacting with the children and characters. The toys would come to life but only visually. There was not enough interaction. I think mainly for this reason a lot of younger children became very restless during the lengthy spells of talking among the characters and they also would not have grasped the storyline or the lesson it showed to always believe in yourself. Therefore, I would certainly not recommend it for children younger than school age, like five or six.  It is a fun packed adventure for all the family.\r\n</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	518	2011-03-26
520	1	16	\N	Bee Movie	<p>\r\nLife as a worker bee is a busy life indeed.  Straight from birth, bees are destined for the honey making career ladder and are literally worked to death in the hive.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFresh from graduation, Barry Benson (voiced by Jerry Seinfeld - Seinfeld [TV]) is sure he is destined for greater things than purely making honey.  On the other hand, his friend Adam (voiced by Matthew Broderick - The Producers) is quite happy to stay in the hive and do a mundane job at Honex for the rest of his life.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBarry has set his sights further afield and after watching the pollen jocks from afar decides to join them on their daily flight outside of the hive.\r\n</p><p>\r\nUnbeknown to his parents and against Adam's advice, Barry goes on his first adventure to explore the human world outside.\r\n</p><p>\r\nHe is amazed to see all the beautiful flowers and forests all around him and he watched the pollination process with great interest.  He finally understands why the pollen jocks have such an important role.\r\n</p><p>\r\nDuring his expedition, Barry gets separated from the pack and ends up colliding with some humans in a tennis match.  This is where he has his first, and forbidden, encounter with a real human, florist Vanessa (voiced by Renee Zellweger - Miss Potter).  The pair strike up an unlikely friendship and soon Barry finds himself taking more and more trips outside of the hive to see his new found lady friend.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBut one day Barry comes across a dark and ugly secret that the humans have kept hidden.  He discovers that the humans are keeping bees trapped in farms and forcing them to make honey for economic gain.  He sees aisles and aisles of bee honey being sold in supermarkets and he is horrified that the bees have been manipulated in such a way.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBy enlisting Vanessa and Adam's help, Barry does something that has never been seen before.  He decides to sue the honey stealing conglomerates to win back the bees' freedom.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWith an all star cast, including cameo voices and animation appearances from Sting and Ray Liotta, Bee Movie is a fun filled fantastic adventure for all the family.  With great voiceovers and excellent animation as well as plenty of humour, Bee Movie not only entertains its audience but also melts the heart of many a bee hater!\r\n</p><p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	520	2011-03-26
529	1	4	\N	St Trinians	<p>\r\nSt Trinian's, the infamous school for "young ladies" is back for a new term.  The original work of cartoonist Ronald Searle has definitely 'exploded' off the page and onto the big screen for the sixth film in the series. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAt the beginning I wasn't too sure what storyline they were trying to follow as a lot of characters and potential storylines were all thrown into the mix. The main storyline was the St Trinian's girls planned heist in order to save their school while battling with the school inspectors.\r\n</p><p>\r\nHeadmistress Camilla Fritton (Rupert Everett - Stardust) is being threatened with closure from the bank, while new Education Minister Geoffrey Thwaites (Colin Firth - Then She Found Me) tries to get the school that encourages expressiveness and self empowerment to conform. Mix in Camilla and Geoffrey's past spicy history, and you have quite a hotpot in itself.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn order for the girls to keep the school from closing, and to avoid having to go to a "proper" school, they put their wit and mischievous ways to good use by planning the heist of the century. Encouraged by the teachers the plan to steal the "Girl with the Pearl Earring" painting (nod to Firth's movie past) from the National Gallery comes together nicely, and is headed by the devilishly charming Flash Harry (Russell Brand - The Abbey [TV]). Also in order to pull off the heist the school has to enter and try to win an inter-school quiz competition.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThere is the usual motley crew of warring fractions at this school, with the emo's, geeks, tarts and the first years being well represented and led by the ultra cool head girl, Kelly (Gemma Arterton - Capturing Mary), helped by new girl Annabelle (Talulah Riley - Pride and Prejudice).\r\n</p><p>\r\nEverett was priceless, and he played both Camilla and Camilla's sly and conceited brother Carnaby very well. There were some cringe-worthy moments, and I was genuinely scared when I thought I'd see Camilla and Geoffrey actually kiss, but this was all part of the fun.\r\n</p><p>\r\nJust don't take this film too seriously, it's not supposed to be a great dramatic masterpiece. It does exactly what it says on the tin - expect all girl power mayhem and laughs.\r\n</p>\r\nIt's difficult to compare St Trinian's to any recent teen movies, another point in its favour, but if I had to push for a comparator I'd say this is a cheeky british comedy akin to the woeful American movie 'Man of the House'. \r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	529	2011-03-26

She airs her views about men and how to snag a good one but freely berates any man who is not worthy.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn her personal life she has bagged a sophisticated and reliable fianc called Richard (Colin Firth - St Trinians) and the two are busy planning the perfect wedding.\r\n</p><p>\r\nUnbeknown to Emma, her love advice has caused some serious heartache.  She advises Sophia to ditch her fireman fianc Patrick (Jeffrey Dean Morgan- PS I Love You) who she has only known for five months.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe wedding is off and Patrick is totally heartbroken.  Sophia was his life and he takes solace in his adopted Indian family.  So when family friend and computer hacker Ajay (Jeffrey Tedmori - Bad News Bears) suggests a way of seeking revenge on the love doctor, Patrick agrees to give her a piece of her own medicine.  \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThe pair decides to falsify a document that declares Emma and Patrick to be husband and wife in a bid to upset her upcoming nuptials.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nWhen Emma and Richard go to register their wedding, to her surprise Emma is told that she is already married!  She is dumped with a stack of annulment papers and heads off to Astoria to find her surprise husband and convince him to annul the marriage.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nWhen Emma arrives Patrick has his fun, gets her stupidly drunk and takes her back to his apartment to sleep it off.  From then on it is a back and forth adventure to try and get the annulment papers signed so that Emma is free to marry Richard.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nBut as we know the path of love never runs smoothly and Emma soon develops a soft spot for Patrick and him for her.  Emma is desperate not to hurt her fianc and has to make a difficult choice between the safe and reliable Richard or the fun and uncouth Patrick, who is the personification of everything she advices her listeners against.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThurman puts in a good performance as the confident and headstrong radio presenter who gets led astray by rough and ready fireman Patrick while reliable Richard is keen to keep their love alive. Morgan is great as the hunky love interest and Firth is as gentlemanly as ever as the straight laced fianc.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThe Accidental Husband is a fun movie for all the family and will appeal to fans of <i>The Wedding Date</i> and <i>50 First Dates</i>.\r\n</p>  \r\n	3	2011-03-26	546	2011-03-26

555	1	20	\N	Meet the Spartans	<p>Mel Brooks brought to cinema some great spoof comedies that shine on as golden monuments to hilarity. The downside is he also made the <i>'spoof' a movie genre and though there have been many great clich comedies such as <i>'Airplane'</i> and <i>'Spy Hard'</i> there have also been some real stinkers.\r\n</p><p>\r\n<i>'Meet the Spartans'</i> is the latest spoof from the makers of <i>'Scary Movie'</i> and as you can guess its main target for abuse is the recent action flick <i>'300'</i>. Any film with 300 muscled men wearing nothing but loin cloths grappling in a homoerotic war movie was destined to be ridiculed and I am a little surprised it took so long for this comedy to arrive.\r\n</p><p>\r\nKing Leonidas (Sean Maguire - Eastenders [TV]), the latent homosexual king who gained his crown after killing a gangster penguin kills a Persian messenger who tongues his wife (Carmen Electra - I Want Candy) and sets in motion the war. Loads of movies and recent media events are dragged in for a joke and while some are funny some fall flat. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIncluded in this latest bucket of bilge are <i>300</i> (of course), <i>Casino Royale</i>, <i>Shrek 3</i>, <i>Happy Feet</i>, <i>Stomp The Yard</i>, <i>Ghostrider</i>, <i>Spider-Man 3</i>, <i>Transformers</i>, <i>American Idol</i>, <i>Dancing with the Stars</i>, <i>America's Next Top Model</i> and even <i>Grand Theft Auto</i>. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThis film is crap, barely funny crap, so crap my brain shut down.

559	1	23	\N	Son of Rambow	<p>\r\nGarth Jennings is clearly a writer-director unafraid to take on difficult projects. Making your debut with an adaptation of cult classic <i>"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"</i>, a book every fan has their own mental version of, was a brave way to make the transition from music videos to film. \r\n</p><p>\r\nHis follow up, <i><b>"Son of Rambow"</b></i>, is an equally ambitious effort, mixing elements of fantasy with family drama and using a cast mainly comprised of children. But, just like his debut, Jennings' second effort irritates as much as it charms. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSet in the early 1980s, when video equipment was just becoming available to the general public, Son of Rambow follows the filmmaking efforts of Lee Carter (Will Poulter), the pre-teen tearaway who we first see smoking in the cinema as he films a pirate copy of <i>"Rambo: First Blood"</i>, and Will (Bill Milner), a shy, artistic misfit from a strict religious family. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAlthough their initial meeting sees Carter hit Will in the head with a tennis ball and then con him out of his watch, the two become friends after watching the Rambo pirate together. Then, in an effort to escape from their unsettled home lives, they decide to have a go at an action film themselves. \r\n</p><p>\r\nBoth young leads give good performances; but they are not quite up to the amount of screen time the plot demands. Milner and Poulter obviously have a lot of talent, but the script has them talking in a clearly unfamiliar style, leading to some scenes sounding as if they are being read off an autocue. \r\n</p><p>\r\nTheir back stories are also unconvincing. Will's repressive home life as part of a religious sect is just about believable, but Carter's domestic set-up doesn't convince at all. His absent mother home-life is all too convenient from a plot-perspective. Also, Ed Westwick gives a truly awful performance as Carter's older brother Lawrence. Westwick's delivery is as shoddy and unconvincing as his 80s wardrobe and monolithic mobile phone. Lawrence's unbelievably motivated emotional turnaround also serves to undercut the impact of Son of Rambow's conclusion as the twosome's film is finished under dramatic circumstances. However, there is a pleasure in finally witnessing the boy's efforts in all their glory. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe revelation of the film within a film is actually one of Son of Rambow's highlights. The problem arises when you notice that the actual film suffers from a lot of the same problems of poor acting, dialogue and character motivation as its mini-film.\r\n</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	559	2011-03-26
568	1	14	\N	The Forbidden Kingdom	<p>\r\nDirected by Rob Minkoff (Stuart Little) and with the original screenplay by John Fusco (Young Guns), The Forbidden Kingdom is based on the traditional Chinese legend of the Monkey King.  The movie also unites martial arts experts Jackie Chan (Rush Hour 3) and Jet Li (War) for the first ever time.  \r\n\r\n<p></p> \r\nAvid Kung-fu geek, Jason Tripitikas (Michael Angarano - Sky High), stumbles across a fabled legend, the warrior Monkey King, who has been imprisoned by the powerful Jade War Lord, while hunting for DVD's in a Chinatown pawnshop. \r\n \r\n<p></p>\r\nTransported through time to ancient China, Jason teams up with a Silent Monk (Jet Li) and a drunken, yet wise, kung fu master (Jackie Chan) to free the fabled Monkey King and defeat the Jade War Lord, along the way learning kung fu in order to survive and succeed.\r\n \r\n<p></p>\r\nFeaturing vivid scenery and colour this is a beautiful movie, matching that of <i>Hero</i> and <i>Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon</i> for all but storyline. Alas if one is to step back this is nothing less than <i>Karate Kid</i> in the 21st century cinema. \r\n \r\n<p></p>\r\nJason Tripitikas is a poor mans Karate Kid with Jet Li/Jackie Chan masquerading as poor imitations of Mr Miyagi.  At one point in the movie we almost have a parody of the "Wax On, Wax Off" scene that is infamous and close to every child's heart from the 1980's. \r\n \r\n<p></p>\r\nGood martial arts scenes are let down heavily by a poor storyline. No doubt will end up a must for all Jet Li / Jackie Chan fans. Otherwise avoid.\r\n</p>	2	2011-03-26	568	2011-03-26
570	1	20	\N	The Orphanage	<p>Following the phenomenal success of 'Pan's Labyrinth' the world has gone crazy for Spanish cinema and if a film gets the nod of Guillermo 'can-do-no-wrong' del Toro then all the better. </p>\r\n<p>Laura was a lonely orphan who was adopted by a loving family. Years later, an adoptive mother herself, Laura and her doctor husband Carlos return to the run down orphanage hoping to renovate it and open it to accommodate new children. Along with Laura and Carlos, they bring their son Simn, an imaginative child in need of love and care. </p>\r\n<p>Little do these three happy homemakers know but the orphanage has an uneasy past that it just itching to make itself heard. Soon after they arrive they are visited by a strange old lady, Benigna, who claims to be a social worker but Laura is suspicious. Soon her concerns are realised when she catches elderly Benigna rummaging through their shed in the middle of the night. \r\n<p>Recovering from that weird interlude Laura and Carlos carry on working to get the house ready while young Simn makes an invisible friend, Toms, who starts a series of frightening games.</p>\r\n<p>During an eventful day opening the orphanage to prospective families, Laura is attacked by a masked child and Simn goes missing. Frantic, Laura searches the house and the garden but can find no clues, only her haunting memory of the creepy old Benigna.</p>\r\n<p>As Laura and Carlos search the world for their missing child the orphanage keeps up with its nasty tricks. Bumps in the night, strange sounds, all add to the growing feeling that the old house has something to say, that the house knows what has happened to Simn.</p>\r\n<p>This film is a gem, a chilling tale of a haunted house that doesn't rely on CGI or excessiveness, just good performances and a story full of emotion and presence. The movie packs in a rollercoaster of feelings including tension, paranoia, creepiness, loss, frustration and of course...horror!</p>\r\n<p>The acting is exceptional and when combined with the brilliant direction this film is a cut above any regurgitated, remade, or rehashed Hollywood drivel. I strongly urge horror fans to see this as soon as they can as no doubt this Spanish movie will be remade, less the brilliance and the brains, for a teenage American audience. I'm not suggesting that American audiences are dumb, just that the American movie industry does strip all life from a film when they unnecessarily clone it.</p>\r\n	5	2011-03-26	570	2011-03-26
582	1	1	\N	Mamma Mia	<p>\r\nThis is the highly acclaimed, highly popular stage musical brought to life on film, with a stellar cast including Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan (Seraphim Falls), Colin Firth (St Trinians), Stellan Skarsgard (Pirates of the Caribbean 3) and Julie Walters (Harry Potter 5). All singing, all dancing, with different levels of success, it has to be said. \r\n</p><P>\r\nThe story begins with Maria (Amanda Siefried - Mean Girls), daughter of Donna (Meryl Streep - Lions for Lambs), who is getting married on the island that she grew up on. She has always been desperate to find out who her real Dad is and steals her mum's diary to find out what she can. \r\n</p><P>\r\nIt transpires that it could be any one of 3 men (Firth, Brosnan and Skarsgard) and behind  her mother's back  she invites them to her wedding. Of course, they all turn up without a second thought and the musical really gets going.Who is her real father? Should she be getting married? Can Pierce Brosnan really sing? \r\n</p><P>\r\nWhat follows is an endless run of well known Abba songs sung by the whole cast. All the favourites are there, it really becomes a guessing game as to how they will weave the next Abba song in to the dubious narrative without it seeming completely contrived. Having said that, it is all rather enjoyable.\r\n</p><P>\r\n Ultimately Abba wrote some great pop songs and it is highly enjoyable to see and hear some acclaimed actors and actresses taking part in a very bright and breezy musical. There's some fabulous greek scenery on show, and the costumes just hit the right note. \r\n</p><P>\r\nMeryl Streep is an absolute star, as she is in many of her films, and has a surprisngly good voice. Julie Walters is playing her usual character and does it well, if you like that sort of thing. Unfortunately the bright young things were rather bland and seemed to be there for eye candy more than anything but the star to be particularly remarked on was Pierce Brosnan. He was absolutely fabulous when he started singing, not because he had the best voice in the world, he doesn't, but watching James Bond singing 'Gimme gimme gimme' was something not to be missed. It was like watching an uncle you are very fond of on the karaoke; endearing, highly amusing and something you just can't take your eyes off. \r\n</p><P>\r\nTo sum up, this was a really enjoyable hour and a half, and provided a couple of things; a) if you like Abba and their music, all major songs are present, b) you like the cast, c) you are willing to accept whatever you see on the screen without question. If you answered yes to all 3 of these you will enjoy this film. This film gets 3 stars overall, but the last scene almost bumped it up - don't miss it!</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	582	2011-03-26
591	1	4	\N	A Complete History of My Sexual Failures	<p>\r\nI've just met the perfect boyfriend - he's lazy, scruffy, messy, lives in a pig sty, doesn't have a job, never has any money, is constantly late and relies on his mother to look after him - oh, and looks a little like Kurt Cobain. \r\n</p><p>\r\nOr at least this is what the director and star of this documentary film thinks makes the perfect partner.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThis documentary was the brainchild of one of life's losers in love, Chris Waitt who was / is single and a serial dumpee. Having found himself dumped, again, after just 3 weeks he came up with the great idea of going round asking all his ex-girlfriends, why? \r\n</p><p>\r\nBut considering he is an ex for a reason, turning up on past girlfriends doorsteps with a big microphone and a camera man in tow is not always going to provide the best results - unless you're the audience.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAt the beginning Waitt's attitude was that this was all a bit of a joke, and that all his ex-girlfriends were mad, and maybe a little crazy for dumping him. But after he reached rock bottom, he realised that the common denominator in all his relationships was him - and the realisation that he was the problem, and that he would have to change his way a little, was thought provoking and very sobering. And funnily enough the most 'sobering' moment came when he was released from his one night at her majesty's pleasure having spent the previous night pestering random women for sex after he'd overdone the alcohol and Viagra.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe film had great comedic timing and at first I thought it was a scripted documentary. It was difficult to understand how, with so many people constantly kicking him down and putting down his ideas, he managed to keep on bouncing back. But after seeing Waitt's self esteem and nave self-delusion being slowly chipped away at, revealing a slightly broken and hopeless man, it was evident this was his real life and that self-delusion had had a big part to play.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBetween the title of this film and the grim picture that accompanied it, I did not have high hopes for the film. But I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised, as was the audience, who laughed, guffawed and winced with sympathetic pain for Waitt in unison - (note: keep an eye out for the vixen's lair).\r\n</p><p>\r\nEven though Waitt is a bit of a loser, he is likeable. If you loved <i>High Fidelity</i> then this would be just up your street.\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	591	2011-03-26
603	1	20	\N	Pineapple Express	<p>\r\nWhen things are going well for a celebrity, the vultures start to circle. If things are going really well those same vultures start to carry guns. For comedy writers Seth Rogen, Judd Apatow & Evan Goldberg (Knocked Up, Superbad), this has been a fantastic year and I imagine they can hear the vulture's wings flapping around their heads. Expectations are seriously high for their latest comedy, Pineapple Express.\r\n</p><p>\r\nA pothead Dale (Seth Rogen - Superbad), hired to serve legal papers to unwitting individuals, witnesses a cop and a crook ruthlessly killing an Asian man.  Unsure where to go Dale takes refuge at the home of his drug dealer, Saul (James Franco - Spider-Man 3). Their safety is soon shattered though as it doesn't take long for our two hapless heroes to realise that the murderer, Saul's source of drugs, can trace them by a dooby Dale left at the crime scene.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWith no other option the two reluctant friends head off on an adventure hoping to find safety and maybe escape the clutches of the evil doers. \r\n</p><p>\r\nDale and Saul are instant classic characters. Dale is a fat thirty something no hoper dating a high school girl and dreams of becoming a radio talkshow host. Saul, on the other hand, is constantly stoned and deals pot to raise money to keep his grandmother in a care home. Unlikely heroes, these two guys are instantly likeable and the quick script is packed with nuggets of greatness. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThis film is packed with pot fuelled comedy and some scenes had me in stitches. I suppose the closest comparator for this movie would be the 'Harold & Kumar' movies, but whereas those films descended quickly into farce this movie somehow keeps to a more linear storyline without diluting the comedy.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nJames Franco, normally a good looking plank, is absolutely hilarious as Saul and often steals the show from Seth Rogan. After the dire Spider-Man 3 I though Franco was lost forever but he has reinvented himself and this is a career best even if in a new direction.\r\n</p><p>\r\nStrongly recommended for fans of <i>Superbad</i>, <i>Knocked Up</i>, and the <i> 'Harold & Kumar'</i> movies.\r\n</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	603	2011-03-26
606	1	18	\N	Elite Squad	<p>\r\nSet in Rio de Janeiro's notorious favelas (the slums on the edge of the city), Elite Squad (Tropa De Elite) is a shocking insight into the corruption that runs rife between the police and the drug traffic barons. \r\n<p></p>\r\nSet in 1997, the film opens with a showdown at an open air rave as two new recruits Neto (Caio Junqueira) and Matias (Andre Ramiro) try to take down the corrupt cops who allow the drug barons virtual control over the city. As the shooting becomes very intense the BOPE (State police special task force) enter the line of fire, distinct in their black uniforms and skull logos they storm the area with a 'take no prisoners' brute force attitude. \r\n<p></p>\r\nThe film then cuts to 6 months earlier when Neto and Matias both joined the police force and follows their journey as they endure hardships and train to become BOPE officers. \r\n<p></p>\r\nNascimento (Wagner Moura) identifies the two childhood friends as his potential replacement; one has the heart of a BOPE officer and the other the strategic mind to deal with the cause. \r\n<p></p>\r\nA gritty shocking film, director Jose Padhila (Bus 174) must be given credit for making such a controversial film which tackles the deep rooted level of corruption in Brazil, from policemen to the politicians and even the NGOs. The real impact of the script may be slightly lost in translation, however, this does not greatly hinder the film. \r\n<p></p>\r\nBased on the accounts of two former BOPE policemen the torture tactics mainly aimed at young teenagers makes uncomfortable viewing and raises many ethical questions about the hard-line stance taken. The impact is however marred by the unnecessary voice over by Nascimento, which detracts from the drama and tries to dictate the viewers' thoughts. \r\n<p></p>\r\nWinner of this year's Berlin Film Festival, this is a shocking film, which fully deserves credit for the portrayal of the war against drugs, as Nascimento says, "In Rio, peace depends on a delicate balance between a thug's bullets and a cop's corruption" and this is captured eloquently. \r\n<p></p>\r\nAs a part drama part biographical account the film leaves a lasting impact of life in Rio and really does show the impact of drugs and corruption as it permeates all aspects of life. The plot however descends into a typical revenge story and I left feeling the only outcome was the replacement of the captain, a somewhat dissatisfying end to an otherwise hard hitting courageous film.\r\n</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	606	2011-03-26
607	1	23	\N	Somers Town	\r\n<p>\r\nSimmering racial tension in the 1980s was the theme for Shane Meadows' last film <i>This is England</i>, but his follow up <i>Somers Town</i> is a softer insight into Britain's ever growing multiculturalism.\r\n</p><p>\r\nShot, for the most part, in black and white and clocking in at a lean 85 minutes, this warm film charts the friendship between a Polish teenager living with his construction worker father in Somers Town, north London, with a runaway from Nottingham, played by This is England's Thomas Turgoose. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThis young British actor puts in another great performance as Tomo, the lippy but lovable stray who arrives in the big city with nothing but a tracksuit, some sovereign rings and a bag, which is promptly stolen from him on his first night. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nYou never know quite what Tomo is running from. But Somers Town doesn't dwell on the darker elements just below the surface of its simple narrative. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe bond that develops between Tomo and Marek (Piotr Jagiello) as they pursue a beautiful French waitress, try to rent out deck chairs in an empty park or steal clothes from the laundrette is hilarious and quite touching. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThe dialogue is so natural it sounds as if huge chunks were improvised, which is impressive from such a young cast. Meadow's naturalistic style of direction adds to this realistic feel. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nUnlike the grittiness of This is England - which stemmed predominantly from the lack of options afforded to its young characters - Somers Town is pervaded with a sense of hope. Although it may be set in a similar working class world, Tomo and Marek are certainly not no-hopers. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThe film's ending may be a touch mawkish, but Somers Town is packed full of such great acting and dialogue that you can forgive that. Shane Meadows has slipped down a gear in terms of intensity, but nothing has been sacrificed in terms of the end result. \r\n</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	607	2011-03-26
608	1	1	\N	The Fox and the Child	<p>\r\nFundamentally a film for children it follows one girl's adventure in the woodland surrounding her home where she becomes fascinated by a vixen that lives and hunts around her. Her persistence in trying to track down her favourite fox pays off both for the girl and the audience. But this isn't simply a children's film, the cinematography, the choices of shots, the quality and the timing veers the film in to documentary and nature programme territory. It could easily have been made as a nature film for adults and perhaps been more successful. It switches mode between the two for the large part reasonably well and attention to detail is fantastic in the film. One can only imagine how much effort it took to getting exactly the right shots throughout, an indulgence that does pay off.\r\n</p><p>\r\nDirector, Luc Jacquet, has a pedigree of making animal films (The March of the Penguins) and this really comes through, the story is based on his childhood although this is by no means an auto-biographical piece. The story is simple and pleasant but as it develops, the personification of the fox character jars with depicting the animal in its natural habitat. It can leave a feeling of unease when the young girl crosses the boundaries. The girl is played by Bertille Noel-Bruneau and she is pleasant enough, if a little tiresome in the latter part of the film. She holds her own considering she is the only human character in the film but an Oscar nomination isn't really in the offing.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nKate Winslet (The Holiday) is bought in for the English version (originally French) as the narrator and the girl's voice is therefore dubbed. This seems to take away some of the natural feeling of the film and with such little dialogue it felt a shame to have not kept the French narrator and the true voice of the little girl. It is such a simple story that even without the translation you, or a child, would be able to follow it quite happily. At just 92 mins it did feel a little long although the last part of the film does pick up a little pace. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nChildren should enjoy this film for its simple narrative, adults should enjoy the beauty of the shots, but be careful, one child in the screening left the cinema crying her eyes out, so it isn't all sweetness and light!\r\n</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	608	2011-03-26
610	1	2	\N	The Rocker	<p>\r\nThe Rocker is the story of Robert 'Fish' Fishman (Rainn Wilson - Juno) the former drummer of 80s heavy metal band Vesuvius. The film begins in the past (1986) with Vesuvius in all their glory performing live. It all seems happiness and unity within the group until their manager, as the devil in disguise, tempts them with fame and money in exchange for getting rid of 'Fish'. And so they chose fame and money. \r\n</p><p>\r\nFish obviously does not take this well. He wants an explanation or revenge but receives neither.  More than twenty years later, we see him in his early forties living a life of unhappiness and frustration and unable to move on from his days as a rock star. \r\n\n</p><p>\r\nThis dissatisfaction makes him lose his job and girlfriend and he ends up moving into his sister's place. Living with his sister and her family, he 'connects' with his geeky teenage nephew and his bandmates of A.D.D (Attention Deficit Disorder). \r\n\n</p><p>\r\nJust a few days before the Prom A.D.D's drummer is grounded and cannot play the gig. Fish, as the last resort, persuades them to take him on as their new drummer. Once settled as the drummer and going through the 'typical' band stages (band gets demo/band gets signed/band goes on tour, etc.) they 'accidentally' reach stardom thanks to the help of Fish's cynical little niece and YouTube. \r\n\n</p><p>\r\nHere you can see the resemblance to <i>The Full Monty</i> when 'unexpected' attention makes the Sheffield guys the town's sensation. Both films share the same director, Peter Cattaneo. \r\n\r\n\n</p><p>\r\nThe Rocker takes you through Fish and A.D.D.'s journey to stardom. It all seems too good to be true until Fish ends up in a similar and almost familiar situation. But things might end up differently this time. \r\n\n</p><p>\r\nThe Rocker is an entertaining film that grabs your attention from the beginning. The comedy genre suits it well as this film will definitely make you smile and laugh. It is quite refreshing to see a 'new' face in American comedy films aside from the popular Adam Sandler and Ben Stiller. And although they are not proposing anything new in this genre, The Rocker is worth seeing. \r\n\n</p><p>\r\nDo not expect complexities or depth but a good few hours of entertainment. The music is quite good as well, same thing, they are not proposing anything new to the music scene but you can tell they worked hard in making this music believable and a good easy-listening pop example. \r\n\n</p>	2	2011-03-26	610	2011-03-26
612	1	1	\N	Linha de Passe	<p>\r\nLinha de Passe comprises of 4 boys and their single, older, pregnant mother who has the arduous task of trying to look after them as best she can in the seemingly dirty, busy and poverty-ridden Sao Paulo. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe notable and highly important absentee is the father figure, he is a central theme that cuts right through the narrative at all times. You are introduced to the 4 boys in quick succession who have notably taken very different paths despite them living in such close proximity to each other. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThe eldest is a Sao Paulo courier, a notoriously dangerous occupation and close to the underbelly of Sao Paulo life, the 2nd has turned to an evangelical church for guidance and for male role models, rightly or wrongly. The 3rd is a talented football player but having just come of age is too old to be taken on by the scouts who regularly are impressed with his footie skills, what can he do to get them to take him on? While the youngest is obsessed with finding his real father, the only one to really acknowledge the vital absent role. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThrough following the boy's lives the film reveals the effects on Brazilian society over the recent years and since the first film (Foreign Land) that was created by the two directors Salles and Thomas (The Motorcycle Diaries, Central Station). \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nSince overthrowing the dictatorship in Brazil the populations of the major cities have increased massively with development happening in a haphazard, random way. Sao Paulo is a city that has too many people for too few jobs, little opportunity for people to work their way out of poverty and limited ways in which young men can develop and grow up. This is depicted through the boys struggling to be valued in their society, constantly battling to become or to remain part of that society and to be successful. Therefore the film does feel quite restless and leaves the viewer with a feeling of anxiousness. The boys are never in the place they want to be and are always striving to get there, although where 'there' is, none of them really know. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThe film is trying to do many things and does them all rather adequately. There will certainly be more to come from the two directors who make gritty, realistic films that offer a window on Brazilian culture. Socially aware and keen to mould the narrative in a very particular way, the directors are highly able filmmakers and willing to take risks, although not always in a wholly satisfactory way for the audience. \r\n</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	612	2011-03-26
615	1	4	\N	The Wave	<p>\r\nWow - fantastic. This film had me gripped throughout. Although filmed in the German language with subtitles, and with a large cast, I was concerned that I would get lost, but the individual characters and their relationships were quickly understood.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBased on a real story, that actually happened in Palo Alto, California, it has been reset in Germany which is more apt considering the storyline content. Teacher Rainer Wegner (Jurgen Vogel: Die Schatzinsel)  who was a bit of an anarchist in his younger days has been giving the job of teaching a group of students about autocracy as part of a week long project. And although initially he was not keen on the idea, the students' arrogance that they were too educated and smart to be sucked into a Nazi style regime of yester-year spurred Wegner to use his class in an unorthodox experiment. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nInitially a success, the experiment, or the Wave as the movement was quickly known as, took on a life of its own. Based on the premise of "strength through discipline, strength through community, strength through action, strength through pride", the class soon became obsessed with the movement, turning into modern day Nazis without realising what they have become and how the movement has taken over their lives. The project gave the students something to believe in and live for within a matter of days. By the end of the week the experiment had worked so well, that Wegner found it difficult to control the group that had seeped out, taking over the school.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThe experiment showed how malleable young, as well as society's, minds are. It was interesting to see how the relationships between normal youngsters changed, such as the cool popular girl in school who became the outcast by not conforming, and how her dowdy sidekick suddenly became someone in her own right with her own voice.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nAnalysing human nature and the social and psychological needs of individuals makes this film very interesting, giving one a lot to think about and makes for a deep after dinner conversational topic and it left me buzzing.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nIf you liked <i>Battle Royale</i>, then this film is just right for you.\r\n</p>\r\n	5	2011-03-26	615	2011-03-26
616	1	20	\N	You Dont Mess With the Zohan	<p>The latest concept comedy from Adam Sandler (Clicks) follows the misadventures of an Israeli secret service agent who fakes his own death so he can start a new life as a hair stylist in America. </p><p>\r\nThis film mixes slapstick comedy with a tinge of adult humour then blends it together with a heavy handed dose of satire (and hummus). This cocktail of comedy works for the most part but does have its occasional moments of stupidity. </p><p>\r\nEarly scenes of a naked Zohan leaving his barbecue on the beach to easily defeat a terrorist stronghold set the extremely silly tone that permeates the movie. This film never takes itself seriously and is all the more enjoyable for it. </p><p>\r\nConsidering this comedy centres itself on the moral conflict between an Israeli secret service agent working as a hair stylist at an Arab hairdresser in America, it somehow manages to carefully avoid offending either side. They manage this by lampooning both sides equally and deciding on a safe common enemy, America. As a blissfully ignorant Brit I have to rely on foreign friends to let me know if this film treads on any toes, thankfully a friend from Lebanon thought this film was hilarious so I think they may have the right balance. </p><p>  \r\nIn the lead role Adam Sandler easily steals the show as Zohan although credit should also be handed to the often berated Rob Schneider (Deuce Bigalow - European Gigolo) who has some great scenes as Zohan's inept wannabe nemesis. </p><p>\r\nUnlikely to stand out as a comedy classic this film is still really good fun and if nothing else reminds us that Adam Sandler can create some great characters. </p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	616	2011-03-26
625	1	16	\N	Max Payne	<p>\r\nIs it just me or are video game advertisements littering the big screen every time we go to see a movie?\r\n </p><p>\r\nYet another video game adaptation <b>Max Payne</b> hits our screens this autumn.  Mark Wahlberg (The Happening) plays detective Max Payne who has been reduced to file chasing following the brutal and mysterious murder of his beloved wife and child.  The department thought he was too emotional and too close to the case to carry on working in the homicide department and relegated him to more menial jobs instead.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBut Max has never given up on finding out the truth behind his wife's murder.  Despite being just a file clerk at the police station, Max still visits his trusty snitches to gleam information on potential rogue criminals who may have information on his wife's killer.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWhile visiting one of his snitch's parties, he bumps into the alluring Natasha (Olga Kurylenko - Quantum of Solace).  Max is not only interested in her back story but is also attracted to her.  The pair almost get closer before Max comes to his senses and throws her out into the cold.  Unbeknown to him, he is the last person to see her alive.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSomeone is out to frame Max for Natasha's death and a string of other brutal murders.  But Max is on a mission to find his wife's killer, to avenge her death and to join his family in heaven, whatever it takes.  For those who know Max, he is a force to be reckoned with and a superb fighter!\r\n</p><p>\r\nLinking in with the style and story of the video game of the same name, the movie does stay true to the original back story and it does follow some of the slow-mo gun and action sequences which the game has become famous for.  However, fans of the video game will probably be disappointed by the lack of action sequences in the movie, although the special effects should be commended and are highly reminiscent of <i>Constantine</i>.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWahlberg plays the vengeful husband very well and keep an eye out for a plethora of other famous faces, even singer Nelly Furtado makes an appearance.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIf you liked <i>Constantine</i> and </i>Resident Evil</i>, go watch this movie.  Expect a second Max Payne instalment in the near future.  \r\n</p>\r\n	1	2011-03-26	625	2011-03-26

As a child orphan she felt unloved and ugly but when she grew up into a beautiful woman her life changed and she was taken under the wing of Hugh Hefner (played by himself).\r\n</p><p>\r\nTo her horror when Shelley turns 27 she is booted out of the Playboy mansion for being too old.  She is distraught that she will never have the chance to fulfil her ambition to be a centrefold.\r\n</p><p>\r\nNow homeless, Shelley wanders the streets trying to find a new family home.  She stumbles across a group of glamorous girls and follows them back to their sorority house.  But in their eyes Shelley is too slutty for their standards and as she isn't a student she doesn't qualify for a place in the house.  When she spots a group of house mothers, Shelley believes she has found her calling.\r\n</p><p>\r\nShe comes across sorority house Zeta full of misfit girls whose lack of popularity will lead to the eventual closure of their house.  Shelley's middle name is popular and she knows she can help the girls to generate the pledges they need to stay afloat.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe geeky Zeta girls are sceptical about Shelley at first but soon warm to her kindness and determination.\r\n</p><p>\r\nShelley uses her natural assets to attract the male attention and appeals to the emotions of the girl voters.  She uses her skills to give her fellow Zeta girls a new look and boost of confidence while she decides to tone down her own Playboy features to please Oliver (Colin Hanks - Unforgettable), the boy next door.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFaris is simply the star and saviour of the movie as sexy Playboy bunny Shelley.  She convincingly puts across the 'bimbo' mentality such as her previous roles in the Scary Movie films.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe House Bunny is a feel good comedy brought to us by the team of <i>Legally Blonde</i>.  Expect silly bimbo humour and plenty of laughs.  Fans of <i>Man of the House</i>, <i>She's All That</i> and <i>The Hottie and the Nottie</i> will enjoy this movie.\r\n</p>	2	2011-03-26	627	2011-03-26

It turns out that an old lady is suffering from a mysterious illness, which consumes almost everyone in its path and condemns the building and its occupants to be quarantined and face a fast and undignified death.\r\n </p><p>\r\nCarpenter puts in a great performance as the terrified TV presenter but the heavy breathing and screams do grate after a while.  While the plot is pretty thin, the scares are aplenty and the scary moments deliver jumpy terror for the viewers.\r\n </p><p>\r\nFans of <i>28 Days Later</i>, <i>The Blair Witch Project</i> and <i>I Am Legend</i> should go and see this movie.    \r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	630	2011-03-26
633	1	21	\N	Changeling	<p>\r\nIt seems that no-one has a bad word to say about Clint Eastwood these days and don't worry, I'm not going to be the one to start. \r\n</p><p>\r\nHis latest directorial effort, Changeling, is another example of a master film maker still at the top of his craft after so many years and so late in his career. If you have seen <i>Mystic River</i> or <i>Million Dollar Baby</i> then you know the type of film to expect. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nBased on a true story, Changeling stars Angelina Jolie (Wanted) as Christine Collins, a single mother in 1920s Los Angeles whose son tragically disappears. The LAPD find a boy claiming to be her son but Christine is convinced the boy is an impostor. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nAlong with the support of Rev Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich - Burn After Reading), Christine contests a gripping legal battle that uncovers police corruption and misuse of power. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nChangeling is an emotional, thought provoking drama and the acting is first class. Don't be surprised if Jolie receives one of those little golden statues early next year for her performance which is possibly the best of her career. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nAlthough it has a lengthy running time of 141 minutes, the story is well paced, shocking at times and holds your attention throughout. In fact, I had to continually remind myself that it was based on true events. I look forward to seeing what Eastwood does next. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nI would recommend this film if you enjoy high quality, well acted drama although be warned it's not for the faint hearted or easily shocked.\r\n</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	633	2011-03-26
635	1	20	\N	The Day The Earth Stood Still	<p>\r\nA mysterious craft arrives at earth with two remarkable occupants. The first is a humanoid who is promptly shot as soon as he offers to shake hands; the other is a menacing giant robot with almost limitless power. Only a few brief words from the ailing alien humanoid, Klatuu, stop the robot from destroying all in its path... and then the movie makers decided to change direction from the original movie.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe 1951 classic <b>'The Day the Earth Stood Still'</b> can easily be considered 'cheesy' by modern standards. The special effects are quite lame and the story is well meaning but at the end of the day it was a B-Movie in the fifties.  That makes it either z-list or 'cult' depending on who you talk to. I class it as iconic and therefore was concerned to hear of a remake.\r\n</p><p>This contemporary retelling rewrites the communist threat and the perils of nuclear power with a fairly honourable environmental message. Sadly, the message, important though it is, falls prey to special effects and a laboured attempt at revealing Klatuu's slow transformation from cold calculator to sympathetic hero. The message is lost and a less than spectacular script doesn't allow much room for Keanu Reeves (A Scanner Darkly) to engender any connection with the audience. He starts the film as a vacant looking alien unwelcome and uncomfortable on Earth and he ends it much the same. A shame when you consider the potential.\r\n</p><p>Some things are good though, like the action, and the abundant effects keep things moving along at a brisk pace. Returning to the screen we have a new and improved GORT, the robot, who is easily the highlight of the movie. Able to seize control of machines, blow missiles out of the sky and still look cool this is one bad ass robot. Sadly the effects of GORT are a little off and he doesn't utterly convince. Still he is a marked improvement over a original which was a tall bloke in an unconvincing rubber suit. \r\n</p><p>This movie maybe was trying for too much. It could have focused more on the intellectual questions with less action or gone for more action with less depth. This film clearly leans toward the latter and loses points for wasted potential. \r\n</p><p>Fun but wasted. \r\n	2	2011-03-26	635	2011-03-26

He has had a troubled life, losing his mother when he was young and looking after his drunk and depressed father. \r\n</p><p>\r\nNow Henry is in his 30s/40s and he is time travelling more than ever before. Most of time he has no control over where he ends up but he does make a regular stop to visit a young girl called Clare (Rachel McAdams - State of Play).\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nSwitching back to his current life as a library archivist, Henry has a chance meeting with a stranger who happens to be Clare, now a grown woman. She has been waiting for this day for most of her life. Clare is amazed that Henry has found his way back into her life as a grown man and she invites him to dinner to fill him in on what she learnt about him as a little girl.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nHenry is confused by what Clare may know about him as well as being in a spin about his time travelling antics and how to try and control it. He soon begins to realise just how close he and Clare have become and how their lives are destined to be entwined forever more. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nBana is superb as the hunky and mysterious time traveller. Similarly, leading lady McAdams puts in a wonderfully heartfelt and emotional performance as the doting wife. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nBased on the novel by Audrey Niffenegger, The Time Traveler's Wife is a deeply moving and emotional romance that will appeal to fans of <i>The Lake House</i> and <i>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</i>. \r\n</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	693	2011-03-26
637	1	23	\N	Dean Spanley	<p>\r\nA stunning performance by Peter O'Toole (Stardust) and a bizarre and moving conclusion are not enough to make <i>Dean Spanley</i> a consistently enjoyable experience. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThis turn of the 20th century-set tale of stifled emotion; complex familial relationships; and a priest who believes he was a dog in a former life; only comes to life in its ending and whenever O'Toole is in the frame. \r\n</p>\r\nThe 76-year-old screen legend is perfect as Horatio, the crabby matriarch of the diminished Fisk family. He deals with the losses of his son and wife by refusing to show emotion and verbally abusing his remaining son, Henslowe. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe repressed angst of the duelling between Jeremy Northam's (The Invasion) Henslowe Fisk and his crabby father promises much, but this good work is undone when the plot tries to shift gear. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThis entertaining relationship between the two Fisks is put aside as Henslowe is drawn to Sam Neill's (The Tudors [TV]) eccentric priest Dean Spanley, after they meet at a lecture on the transmigration of souls.\r\n</p><p>\r\nHenslowe is searching for some spiritual truth to cope with his brother's death during the Boer War, while Spanley has a more left-field reason for attending; he believes he formally lived as a dog. \r\n</p><p>\r\nKiwi director Toa Fraser loses his way as the film degenerates into a series of episodes as Henslowe tries to extract more information from Spanley over a series of dinners, washed down with the eccentric clergyman's favourite tipple and the source of his openness about reincarnation, Imperial Tokay. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSam Neill's performance is excellent; he brings poignancy to Spanley's recollections of his past canine roving that could have seemed ridiculous in a lesser actor's hands. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAs Henslowe, Northam is just too bland for a demanding central role that has a huge amount of screen time. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIf you can endure the slow pace of the set-up and Northam's dry performance, Dean Spanley's ending is a truly unique piece of cinema.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIt may be a clich to say something will make you 'laugh and cry', but that's how this odd, sweet, funny and emotive scene works. \r\n</p><p>\r\nCentral to the ending's success is O'Toole. Dean Spanley's closing scenes show he can still use those famous piercing eyes to convey countless turbulent emotions. \r\n</p><p>\r\nIt's just a shame a few more cuts and adjustments couldn't have been made to what comes before.\r\n</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	637	2011-03-26

Reminiscing Frank is now a retired specialist in high risk deliveries. Forced to come out of retirement, literally at gunpoint, Frank has to transport two bags and a young woman. Who she is or what is in the bags are both questions he is yet to answer, let alone what awaits him on delivery.\r\n </p><p>\r\n\r\nBuilding on the previous two installments, this movie, the third in the franchise contains faster, longer, angrier action sequences. Well choreographed with the signature Statham humour. The old foundations are still present, a Black Audi, dare devil driving, action scenes to thrill all, humour and the token beautiful lady. This, however, like Casino Royale (James Bond) shows a different side to the lead, Frank Martin, a softer side. Falling in love finally we see more emotion in Statham's performance as opposed to all brawn and successful it is. Not an Oscar winning performance but a good film nonetheless for its genre. \r\n</p><p>\r\n \r\nSimple, action packed, humorous, sexy, hunky. Enough packed in to appeal to both the male and female audiences on a mindless Friday night but enough hook to get the brain ticking, awake and alert.\r\n</p><p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	641	2011-03-26

649	1	14	\N	Slumdog Millionaire	<p>\r\nA vibrant modern love story based on the bestselling novel "Q&A" by Vikas Swarup, Danny Boyle's (Trainspotting) film adaptation Slumdog Millionaire set in India is captivating from the start. \r\n</p><p> \r\nA tale of a battle of wits and love over adversity, combined with a rollercoaster ride from infancy to young adult leads us to Jamal Mailk, an 18-year old orphan from the slums of Mumbai. About to experience a once in a lifetime opportunity to win 20 million Rupees in India's 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?', Jamal is arrested during an overnight break in the show and thus begins the story of his life. How he, a slumdog, a "chai walla" is innocent, how in each episode of his life lies the answer to each of the various questions on 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?' and how the entangled lives of himself, his brother Salim and his love Latika (the self proclaimed three musketeers) and their adventures together on the road, vicious encounters with local gangs and the loss of his love leads him to be tortured, mocked and heartbroken.\r\n</p><p> \r\nBeautifully shot and atmospheric this story of India is humorous yet at times also hard-hitting, a somewhat implausible scenario works beautifully with clever cinematography/editing (story flashbacks), strong acting and vivid scenery/scenarios.\r\n</p>	4	2011-03-26	649	2011-03-26
652	1	4	\N	Valkyrie	<p>\r\n<b>Valkyrie</b> is based on a true story of a German Colonel who, having pledged allegiance to Hitler, realises that the love for his country is more important and plots to overthrow Hitler's regime. The year is 1943, and Tom Cruise (Tropic Thunder) plays the lead, Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, a loyal officer who recognises that his country is being torn apart as Hitler's rise leads to WWII. While out in the field the Colonel tries to figure out how to make a stand and he is seriously injured, losing one hand, a couple of fingers and an eye.\r\n</p><p>\r\nReturning back home as a hero, Stauffenberg joins forces with the German Resistance who have members in the highest level of power and who have been plotting for a while on how to get their country back. When Stauffenberg comes onboard he has an idea to use Hitler's own emergency plan, Valkyrie, to stabilise the government in the event of his death. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nWith a plan in place, Stauffenberg becomes the one who undertakes the mission to kill Hitler himself. With the fate of his country, family and his life hanging in the balance, Stauffenberg relies on the Resistance to complete their side of the plan once he gets the ball rolling. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nFilmed in Berlin using many of the locations where events really happened helped to give the film a real and sobering edge.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nCruise fell into his usual serious typecast, which was exactly what the role called for, although I have to admit his American accent jarred with me at first - but all in all, he was great in the role as the Colonel. As a side note, none of the actors spoke with a German accent, including the Germans. The film was tense and gritty, and the suspense kept everyone on the edge of their seat throughout the film.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThere were a few big names there including Kenneth Branagh, Tom Wilkinson, Eddie Izzard and my favourite Bill Nighy, who played Friedrich Olbricht, a fellow Resistance member. Although he played a serious role, he still had one or two of the best lines. There was even a chuckle from the audience when he swore once!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nNominated for a number of Oscars and Baftas, this film was really enjoyable and eye-opening. It also goes to show that not all Germans were supportive of Hitler's mindset. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nI would happily recommend this film and if I were to compare it to anything else I would say it was like Stauffenberg and <i>Schindler's List</i>. \r\n</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	652	2011-03-26
658	1	8	\N	My Bloody Valentine	\r\n<P>My Bloody Valentine is a high-tech modern remake of the 1981 slasher film of the same name, but fortunately it is not simply a carbon copy with the story updated and new twists, turns and scares added with great effect. And then, of course, there are the 3D effects but more on those later. \r\n</P><P>\r\nThe premise is hardly original, a seemingly invincible psychotic killer terrorises a small town in America with a series of gory murders centred around the anniversary of a tragic event, in this instance a mining accident on Valentine's Day. \r\n</P><P>\r\n\r\nThe script is simplistic and the plot is not over complicated, but the cinematography makes good use of light and dark to ably set the tone of the movie. The score is subtle, but does enough to accentuate the mood as the tension builds. \r\n</P><P>\r\n\r\nThere are few complaints about the casting of the roles, although at times Jensen Ackles (Supernatural [TV]) struggles to convey the depth of Tom Hanniger's inner torment as he attempts to come to terms with the trauma of the brutal events of the past as he returns to Harmony 10 years later. Kerr Smith (Final Destination) is adequate as Hanniger's rival Axel Palmer, although perhaps slightly unconvincing as the town sheriff. But generally, they play parts well and with gusto. \r\n</P><P>\r\n\r\nThe big winner is the use of the 3D medium, which really makes the film. Not only do the flying pick-axes increase the scares (I defy you not to duck!), but it also adds a dash of originality to proceedings. Recent attempts at reviving the 'slasher' movie through a series of remakes have largely failed, so this could be the shot in the arm that this much maligned genre needs. \r\n</P><P>\r\n\r\nDirector Patrick Lussier has been canny in picking a somewhat lesser known film to rework, and that instantly has lightened the weight of expectation that was attached to the recent outings of <I>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</I> (2003) and <I>Halloween</I> (2007),   not to mention the recent <I>Friday the 13th</I> release. \r\n</P><P>\r\n\r\nAll good 'slasher' films should be more than just gore and sex (although, for the purists it is worth noting there is an extended sequence involving a very naked, blonde female) and <I>My Bloody Valentine</I> does deliver that. It's not a classic like the original <I>Halloween</I> (1978) and <I>Friday the 13th</I> (1980) and, more recently, <I>Scream</I> (1996), but it's certainly an enjoyable step in the right direction. </P><P>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	658	2011-03-26

Fanning, as usual, steals the show with a very grown up and serious performance, almost an adult trapped in a child's body. Hounsou fails to put a menacing edge on his character but nevertheless is always a joy to watch while Belle is simply the eye candy for the male viewers.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nPush offers an interesting take on the saturated mutant/super power genre with a grittier and edgier feel. Almost a cross between X-Men and Jason Bourne.\r\n</p><p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	660	2011-03-26
668	1	14	\N	Fast and Furious 4	<p>More street racing and fast action sequences return to the screen in the latest installment of "The Fast and the Furious" series. \r\n</p><p>Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel - Babylon AD) and his arch nemesis LAPD Officer Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker - The Lazarus Project) return on opposite sides of the law to renew their old rivalry and love interests as they eventually join forces to street race, brawl and fight against a common enemy.\r\n</p><p>This instalment leaves behind somewhat the glam and the glitz of the previous 1, 2, & 3. Less bling, reduced funky music, hardly any skimpily clad babes and, worst of all, very little obviously suped up rice rockets (cars) taking to the screen.\r\n</p><p>In an attempt to make Dominic Torretto more human, a softer side of him is shown introducing the strength between him and his partner, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez - Lost [TV]). However this has the softening effect of plastering concrete onto a coarse brick. None too pleasing, damp and wet in delivery. This new found heart and humility, combined with the lack of previous glitz and glam lead to a disappointing movie in the quadrilogy. A poor choice of script and cinematography for a movie of this genre. Avoid.\r\n</p>\r\n	2	2011-03-26	668	2011-03-26

On the other side, Saya is also working together undercover for The Council, a secret organisation who want to lure out Onigen and rid the streets of vampire kind.\r\n</p><p>\r\nDuring a secret undercover operation, Saya poses as a student at the US military base's school where she meets the general's daughter Alice (Allison Miller - 17 Again). Alice, a typical weak victim, is constantly being taunted by the school bullies who are hiding a deep dark secret. Saya comes to Alice's rescue and the two strike up an unlikely friendship.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWhen Alice gets thrust into Saya's dark world, she witnesses the strength and agility of the seemingly mild mannered Japanese student. Alice decides to follow Saya on her quest to defeat the most evil and powerful vampire, Onigen.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe main female leads played by Jun and Miller are both extremely poor. Jun is one of the most unconvincing actresses I have seen when it comes to portraying emotion but I must give her credit for the physical arse-kicking scenes. Miller is a soppy and pretty boring character who fails to evoke any care or emotion from the audience.\r\n</p><p>\r\nI had high hopes for this movie but it left me wishing I had been beaten to death by the vampire slayer herself! While the fight scenes were good, the acting was poor and the character development was virtually non-existent. The movie recreated familiar scenes from films such as <i>Underworld</i>, <i>Blade</i> and <i>The House of Flying Daggers</i> and therefore lacked originality.\r\n</p><p>\r\nNot a movie I would recommend to vampire or kung-fu fans. If you do dare to watch it, prepare to be sorely disappointed.\r\n</p> \r\n	1	2011-03-26	687	2011-03-26

I should like this film; my wife loves dance movies and makes me watch them against my will, but at the end of the day this is just crap spoofing light entertainment.\r\n</p><p>I can't blame the actors; they're hoping this will raise their profile so they can get in a good film. I can't blame the dancers because they were good and their abilities are untainted by the woeful cowpat this movie truly is. I blame the scriptwriters and in particular the studios who feed on those poor unfortunate people who actually find these films good.\r\n</p><p>True, I concede that humour is a matter of taste and it is hard to objectively say what makes a great comedy but I'm pretty confident this isn't it. This is an exercise is most profit for least content.\r\n</p><p>PLEASE STOP THE PAIN!!!!\r\n</p><p>In a search for something laudable in this bucket of arse gravy I can only applaud the scriptwriters for surviving the mauling of their last spew of chunder to wretch again onto the big screen.\r\n</p><p>Avoid like the plague!!!!</p>\r\n	0	2011-03-26	696	2011-03-26
700	1	20	\N	District 9	<p>One sunny afternoon an alien mother ship arrives on Earth to make peaceful contact with humanity. They do not pick London, New York or even Paris as their destination; instead they pick Johannesburg in South Africa.</p><p>\r\nAfter breaking into the spaceship, mankind finds a population of malnourished aliens seeking shelter. An area of the Johannesburg suburbs is designated 'District 9', a new home for our alien guests. </p><p>\r\nFilmed in documentary style, 'District 9' follows the actions of a liaison officer, Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley), as he tries to relocate the aliens to new 'District 10'. Sadly relations between mankind and the guests are tense and soon the forced relocation degenerates into violence and intolerance. </p><p>\r\nCaught in the fray and exposed to a strange alien chemical agent, Wikus's life as he knows it is over. The human military want alien weapons, the aliens want to go home, the Nigerian gun runners want power and Wikus just wants everything back to normal. </p><p>\r\nThis film has several layers and each may appeal to a different audience. On one level it is an action alien movie. From this angle it is a little slow to get going and the lower budget means that the effects are not as astounding as a Hollywood blockbuster. </p><p>\r\nOn a different level it is a clever Science Fiction movie that tackles weighty issues such as 'first contact', racial intolerance, and the corruption of power. From that angle it is brilliant. The setting of South Africa gives this film a political resonance. Apartheid may be a thing of the past but the racial divide is still present in South Africa with millions living in townships. This mirrors well with the millions of 'prawn' aliens forced to live in camps by the human overlords. Atop that they mix in the reality of unscrupulous corporations feeding off the poor and the upwardly spiralling price of cat food. </p><p>\r\nAt long last we have an intelligent alien movie and it comes from South Africa. </p><p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	700	2011-03-26

However, I must give praise to the talented dancers, singers and actors who shine throughout the film.\r\n</p><p> \r\nNo single actor or actress stands out enough to deserve a particular mention but do keep an eye out for an appearance by Kelsey Grammer (Frasier [TV]).\r\n</p><p> \r\nFans of <i>Step Up<i> and </i>Save the Last Dance</i> will most probably be sorely disappointed by this latest dance flop. \r\n</p><p>	2	2011-03-26	705	2011-03-26
711	1	18	\N	500 Days of Summer	<p><i>"I think you should know up front, this is NOT a love story"</i>, states the voiceover at the beginning of the film.</p><p>\r\nIt is, however, a boy meets girl romance.  Tom Hansen, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, (Killshot and Uncertainty) is a greeting card writer who believes he will never be truly happy until he meets his 'one true love'.  Summer Finn played by Zooey Deschanel (Yes Man) does not share this sentiment and so begins their romantic story which unfolds through a series of disjointed memories and events from Tom's perspective, as he tries to make sense of their relationship and understand why it didn't work out.     </p><p>\r\nIt is a refreshing change to watch an unconventional romantic comedy through the eyes of the character Tom; who believes whole heartedly in the power of love to make you truly happy and who falls for his opposite; a woman who believes more in just having fun while <i>"they are young and can enjoy it." </i></p><p>\r\nThere is a lot of promise in this film and the real beauty lies in the jumbled up chronology, as the audience strings together the memories of the relationship with Tom as he begins to see things from a different perspective.  The writers Neustadter and Weber both drew from their own experiences of being in love and the result is a realistic take on how modern relationships play out. </p><p>\r\nUnfortunately, one of the main detractions from an otherwise beautifully told romance is the inclusion of a choreographed dance routine and cartoon bird more appropriate for Bollywood, rather than a modern day romance.   </p><p>\r\n\r\nA perfectly watchable film and one which does leave a feeling of hope and faith in the power of love.  However, it did fall below my expectations and while it was funny in parts and sad in others, overall it didn't move me to tears nor make me laugh all the way home. </p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	711	2011-03-26
712	1	18	\N	Chevolution	<p>Chevolution is about the iconic image of Ernesto "Che" Guevara captured by Cuban photographer Alberto "Korda" Dias in 1960.  The image was taken during a mass funeral. Today, it is regarded as the most reproduced iconic image in the history of photography and is now titled <i>"Guerrillero Heroico" </i>(Heroic Guerrilla).  </p><p>\r\nThe main premise of the film is to educate those who succumb to fashion and wear the image in the form of T-shirts and other paraphernalia yet who know very little about the man and what he stood for.  It is a tragic irony that, today, the image has been used to market goods globally and fuel the capitalist economy, going against the principles the Marxist revolutionary fought against.  </p><p>\r\nThe documentary is a useful resource for anyone who wants to gain an insight into the life of the Argentine-born Cuban revolutionary leader.  It gives a succinct summary of his life and has incredible footage showing Che with Fidel Castro.  The documentary moves seamlessly from the past to the present day phenomenon, speaking to important modern day revolutionaries such as Gerry Adams, as well as established actors Antonio Banderas and Gael Garcia Bernal.  The documentary also features interviews with young American students who wear the T-shirts with the image and yet have no appreciation for Che and the moral and ideals he symbolises.  </p><p>\r\nBy far the most compelling of the interviews are the scenes with Diana Diaz Korda, the daughter of Alberto Korda.  The image is now copyright protected by the Korda estate in an attempt to prohibit its use of endorsing goods such as cigarettes, perfume and alcohol, all of which go against the morals and ideals Che symbolises.  The documentary also interweaves discussions with Shepard Fairy and Jim Fitzpatrick, both of whom have profited from the image of Che exploring the global cult-like following which has developed over the last decade.   </p><p>\r\nAlthough this film may not be designed to appeal to the majority of 'escapist' cinema goers, the discerning audience will find this film a welcome departure from the norm with a strong blend of visuals.  However, the sometimes patronising repetition detracts from the rich and intriguing life of Che and some of the discussions, particularly with reference to Jesus Christ, felt tenuous and unnecessary.  Nonetheless, it is still a worthwhile documentary which gives a rounded account of the importance of Che Guevara and will at least aim to educate those who wish to know more about the man behind the image which, as Korda stated, shows "absolute implacability". </p><p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	712	2011-03-26

734	1	16	\N	From Paris with Love	<p>Rookie intelligence operative James (Jonathan Rhys Meyers - Tudors [TV]) works in the US Ambassador's office in Paris. He is a normal guy keeping a low profile who gets on with his job and has a beautiful girlfriend at home, Caroline (Kasia Smutniak - Goal! III) On the side, he does small jobs for an unknown caller like swapping plates on cars. He has high hopes to move on to bigger and better jobs if he impresses his secret boss.\r\n<p></p>His dreams soon come true when James is paired up with a crazy wise-cracking partner, Wax (John Travolta - The Taking of Pelham 123). James realises he has hit the big time when he finds out that Wax has been sent to Paris to uncover a terrorist plot.\r\n<p></p>The pair do not have much in common - James has a methodical and peaceful approach while Wax is wild and out of control. Together they make the perfect crime-stopping team!\r\n<p></p>Meyers was surprisingly impressive in this movie and I was especially amazed by his convincing French and Mandarin! Travolta was fabulous as always as the loose cannon who delivers hilarious one-liners as the thug of the team.\r\n<p></p><i>From Paris with Love</i> has the ingredients you need for an action film - guys, girls, guns and fight scenes. The pairing of Meyers Travolta is strangely reminiscent of Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker in the Rush Hour movies. If you enjoyed those films then this is right up your street!</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	734	2011-03-26
758	1	27	\N	The Expendables	\r\nAs any defeated action film villain from the 80s would probably tell you, Sylvester Stallone should never be underestimated. Back in his heyday, the 80s, he was one of the most iconic action heroes and although the years have passed he has managed to keep going. The critics will probably mock the old man for his efforts but why? The recent <i>Rocky</i> movie was nostalgic if a little silly but with his follow up <i>Rambo</i> movie he demonstrated that people still want to see the strong mumbling killing machine. \r\n</p>\r\nAfter the quiet success of these two franchise revivals, Stallone has found his stride and now he not only wants to liven up a franchise, he wants to liven up a genre. The mindless action flick is back!\r\n</p>\r\nBack in the 80s there were loads of classic movies that by today's standard are macho nonsense with poor acting and blah blah blah, but yet we still love them. \r\n</p>\r\nThe Expendables is a great recipe that at first sounds too daft to be true but then you realise the possibility, and then when you see it you're blown away. Stallone has called in favours and got a crop of veteran action giants together on screen and mixed it up with some of the more recent stars of the genre. The cast list is a who's who of whoopus and even if the plot is weak the premise itself promises pain. A group of mercenaries are hired to depose a corrupt general who is producing and distributing cocaine assisted by a crooked former CIA agent. \r\n</p>\r\nThe review is easy; no need to comment on storyline, character development or acting (although a brief nod to Mickey Rourke for a golden moment of soul searching). This is action and it starts as it means to go on with a night time raid on a tanker that has been seized by pirates. The fighting then takes a brief hiatus so 'the job' can be described and then it's action to the end.\r\n</p>\r\nStallone leads the fight both in front and behind the camera. He is director, producer, writer and the primary lead actor. Responsibility rests on those pumped up shoulders and finds a stable purchase. The film delivers in spades. His dislike for CGI and his insistence on doing his own stunts adds that little bit extra missing from most recent action films. \r\nYou're guessing I liked this. You're right. To find a chink in the armour I can fall back on the obvious; the story is as well trodden as the steps to St Paul's and the acting as wooden as the horse they dragged into Troy. The camera work in some fight sequences was a little bit too close to the action but I'll forgive it because the scene with the air raid on the dockside was AWESOME!\r\n</p>\r\nStallone, please make a sequel , please make a diamond sequel. \r\n</p>	4	2011-03-26	758	2011-03-26
765	1	16	\N	Jackboots on Whitehall	<p>An impressive debut feature film for co-writers and co-directors Edward and Rory McHenry, <i>Jackboots on Whitehall</i> is a 'what if...' spoof of a Nazi invasion on Britain.  Using pioneering puppetry and a stellar cast of voiceovers including Ewan McGregor, Rosamund Pike and Timothy Spall to name but a few, Jackboots is a comic adventure story which begins in a remote country village set during World War II.  </p><p>\r\n\r\nChris (Ewan McGregor -The Men Who Stare at Goats) plays a lowly farmer rejected from joining the Army for having unusually big hands responds to a cry of help from Winston Churchill (Timothy Spall - Alice in Wonderland) and alongside his childhood sweetheart Daisy (Rosamund Pike - Surrogates) and the other villagers rescues Churchill from capture. They then join in the fight against the Nazi invasion retreating to the North 'Scot Land' from which they build their army and battle with the Nazi's.  </p><p>\r\n\r\nThe main strength of this film lies in the blend of old fashioned cinematography camera angle shots with more modern techniques and use of CGI to make the film edgy and yet comical.  This manages to make the puppets more lifelike in the close up shots adding to the drama and emotion in the scenes. There is also amazing attention to detail from the puppets and their outfits right through to the scenes and long shots which adds to the enjoyment of the film.  </p><p>\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the storyline is disappointing. What begins as a promising storyline revolving around a quaint village in Kent with subtle war humour such as the FANY organisation slowly descends into a ridiculous plot line complete with outrageous scenes and nonsensical dialogue.  There are still some moments of irony and laughter but unfortunately they are lost in the sheer outlandish scenes of Nazi invasion, repeated battle scenes and the blowing up of historical landmarks. </p><p>\r\n\r\nMoreover while the battle scenes are shot recreating Whitehall there is no direct reference to Jackboots which leaves the title as a somewhat tenuous reference to the film rather than a strong link to the main storyline.  </p><p>\r\n\r\nA fun enjoyable, if rather ridiculous, spoof, <i>Jackboots on Whitehall</i> is an entertaining film with impressive special effects and detail.  There are some moments of humour and some scenes which really push the boundaries of historical and political correctness.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nFans of comedies such as <i>Team America</i> and <i>Thunderbirds</i> will enjoy this film as well as those who still appreciate the golden classics of war humour sketches, <i>Blackadder</i> and <i>Monty Python.</i>  </p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	765	2011-03-26

Beneath his house he has an army of mindless but cute minions who help him prepare for his massive criminal plans. When one of his competitors, Vector (Jason Segel - I Love you, Man), steals the Great Pyramid of Giza, Gru must convince the world he has what it takes to be the bigger baddie!\r\n</p>\r\nAs Gru puts his plan together he has to sneak into Vector's house to steal a shrink ray but every time he tries to break in Vector manages to outwit him with lasers, missiles, and even a shark! Then one day Gru notices that Vector has a soft spot for cookies delivered by three adorable little orphan girls and Gru sees his chance. </p>\r\n\r\nThe next day Gru adopts the three little girls and hopes to use them to gain access to Vector's house but then something unexpected happens; he finds himself enjoying being a dad. Can Gru be a good dad and a good villain? </p>\r\n\r\nGru and his army of adorable minions are wonderful characters and although the story is quite slow by the end of the film you love them all.  The animation is of good quality and the action pieces are well thought out. What was particularly good for me (at the young age of 32) was the well placed movie references and repeat jokes (anti gravity potion anyone) that kept me chuckling throughout. </p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	771	2011-03-26

772	1	18	\N	Red	<p>This film would score at least a 4 out of 5 if an extra 10-15 minutes of script/film had been added. Co-written by James Marsh and Milo Addica (Monsters Ball, The King is striking and shocking. However, what it lacks is depth and background to the reasons behind Elvis Sandow's (Gael Garcia Bernal) actions. Though slight revelations to Elvis' background are made throughout the film these are non-revelatory and lack substance. Elvis' history is not painted early on and what results is a film that wanders from the sweet and sensual to the brutal and bloody, leaving the audience throughout with more questions than answers.\r\n</p><p>\r\nStrong, if not outstanding, performances are displayed throughout by the four lead characters: Elvis Sandow (Gael Garcia Bernal - Bad Education), Pastor David Sandow (William Hurt - A History of Violence), Malerie Sandow (Pell James - Uptown Girls) and Paul Sandow (Paul Dano - Taking Lives), it is a pity they are let down by the omissions within the script. Perhaps the strong influences of religion, the story of Cain and Abel and the theme of redemption play a part in this omission, what can't be forgotten however are the strong musical talents of Pell James and the twinkly eyes/bewitching smile of Gael Garcia Bernal. \r\n</p><p>\r\nUnless you are a budding actor, wait for the DVD release and with it a Director's Cut that hopefully will fill the gaps presented in its cinematic release.\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	772	2011-03-26
779	1	16	\N	Due Date	<p>Taking a break from playing a billionaire superhero or an iconic Victorian detective, Robert Downey Jnr (Iron Man 2) teams up with Zach Galifianakis (The Hangover) in the latest odd couple road trip movie. </p>\r\nDowney Jnr stars as Peter, a temperamental architect desperate to get home to LA to witness the birth of his first child. After a fracas with bearded eccentric Ethan (Galifianakis), Peter is grounded and banned from travelling by aeroplane. With only a few days to get home, and with no wallet, Peter's only way of getting home is to share a rental car with Ethan. </p>\r\nAfter a few hours in the car it is apparent that this journey will be anything but smooth. Car chases, drugs, handicapped war veterans, and a serious car accident all combine to test Peter's nerves. If you feel you've seen something similar, you probably have. Very closely resembling<i> 'Trains, Planes and Automobiles'</i>, you'll not be surprised to learn that both members of this odd couple have issues they need to address and beneath the comedy there is a very human story and before they get to the hospital they'll be true friends. </p>\r\nDowney Jnr walks through this film and still manages to add a layer of drama to his character, his short fuse personality, but the surprise was Galifianakis who managed to put in some quite convincing and emotional scenes. </p>\r\nThis film is by no means original but it is great fun all the same. Most of the funniest scenes were in the advert but there are still a few classic moments to reward you for your time.  Recommended for fans of<i> 'Road Trip'</i>,<i> 'The Hangover' </i>and <i> 'The Soloist'</i>. </p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	779	2011-03-26
781	1	16	\N	Skyline	<p>\r\nSkyline gets straight to the point as the movie opens with a strange blue light entering an apartment and a girl screaming.\r\n</p>\r\nJarrod (Eric Balfour - Haven [TV]) and his girlfriend Elaine (Scottie Thompson - Drop Dead Diva [TV]) are visiting from New York and staying with their friend Terry (Donald Faison - Scrubs [TV]) in his Penthouse suite. \r\n</p>\r\nAfter a late night party, they are awoken by an eerie light and screams from Terry's assistant Denise (Crystal Reed - CSI: NY [TV]) as one of their friends disappears right in front of her eyes.\r\n</p>\r\nWhen they pluck up the courage to look outside, they discover that the eerie blue light is coming from strange spaceships that are attacking Los Angeles.\r\n</p>\r\nThey soon realise that they are now confined to the suite and have no real way to escape. On scoping out the situation, Terry & Jarrod come up with a plan B. The water seems to be free of spacecrafts so if they can just make it to the water safely then they might be able to float their way to survival on Terry's boat.\r\n</p>\r\nThat big idea gets shot down (literally!) as soon as they try to leave the building. The spaceships are super intelligent and react as soon as they detect any human movement. No-one is safe once they are exposed to the aliens.\r\n</p>\r\nAfter teaming up with the hotel manager Oliver (David Zayas - Dexter [TV]), the group's chance of survival does move up a notch! Typically though half the group ignore his recommendations and go it alone. Will they survive on leaving the safe confines of the hotel?\r\n</p>\r\nThis movie is literally littered with TV stars throughout the cast rather than any big A-listers. You may even recognise Terry's girlfriend Candice (Brittany Daniel) from Sweet Valley High. \r\n</p>\r\nSkyline showed promise at the very start but was let down by cheesy and over exaggerated scenes. Not a patch on the recent alien success movies of District 9 and War of the Worlds. </p>\r\n	1	2011-03-26	781	2011-03-26

Quite a few chance meetings actually!\r\n </p>\r\nWhen June boards her flight, little does she know but Roy is no normal passenger. He is about to take out the rest of the flight and take control of the plane!\r\n</p> \r\nNext thing she knows, June is on the run from Roy who is adamant that she is safer with him than trusting the FBI agents who are also tailing them.\r\n </p>\r\nTo June, Roy is just a rogue agent and all she wants is her quiet life back again. But now she has met Roy her life will never be the same again.\r\n </p>\r\nCruise and Diaz play their parts well and both show some impressive kick-ass fight moves. The car chases are another must-see. \r\n</p>\r\n \r\nThe movie is entertaining but doesn't offer much of a storyline and isn't as funny as I expected it to be. Fans of <i>Charlie's Angels</i> and <i>Mission Impossible</i> should like this slightly more comical action adventure.\r\n </p>\r\nAnd the reason behind the film's name - Roy's family name is Knight but who is Day? That's probably the only part that will keep you guessing!\r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	761	2012-03-08
783	1	25	\N	Sex and the City 2	<p>Moving on from the heartache of the first movie, the sequel tiptoes into more fun and humorous territory.</p>\r\nTo add some spice and open up the movie, cue a huge sparkly gay wedding and hilarious rendition of 'All the Single Ladies' by Liza Minelli to liven things up! </p>\r\nSo what have the girls been up to since we last saw them? Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker - Did You Hear About the Morgans?) and Big (Chris Noth - The Good Wife [TV]) have reached a slump in married life where Big is happy to just laze around in their apartment all day. </p>\r\nMeanwhile, Miranda (Cynthia Nixon - The Big C [TV]) is frustrated with her boss, Charlotte (Kristin Davis - Couples Retreat) is overwhelmed by motherhood and Samantha (Kim Cattrall - The Ghost) is struggling with the menopause. </p>\r\nSo when single lady Samantha snaps up an all-expenses paid trip to Abu Dhabi, the girls jump at the chance for a pick-me up trip to help them forget about their troubled lives back in New York. </p>\r\nAs you can imagine, the girls get up to their usual antics in the desert, wearing inappropriate clothing, making lewd gestures and flirting outrageously. Definitely an eye-opener for the Arabs! </p>\r\nThis second movie is definitely more fun and full of classic one-liners compared with its more serious predecessor. Despite being set in the glamorous Abu Dhabi, the movie was filmed in Morocco and I always begrudge this as I feel the country it was filmed in should get more credit. </p>\r\nSpeaking to avid fans of the TV show and the first movie, while this second helping was fun the consensus is that that the filmmakers should have stopped at the first film. Watch it and decide for yourself. </p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	783	2011-03-26
784	1	27	\N	The Hunter	<p>\r\nAn Iranian and German production, this film tells the story of a man (Rafi Pitts, also director) who loses his wife and child and wants revenge, but has no idea how to achieve it. He chooses to make it up as he goes along, with understandably puzzling consequences. Luckily it is clear that the film-maker didn't have the same philosophy.\r\n</p>\r\nThe start of the film is rather slow to get going and empathy for the main character takes a little while to surface, despite the early loss of his beloved wife and child. Don't worry though, it definitely warms up and gets going once his plan of revenge is instigated.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nThe cinematography is strong with some stunning city landscapes and bleak vistas that fit the bleak atmosphere of the film throughout. When he finally decides on his plan, he takes himself and a gun up to one of the highest points of the city, up a steep and jagged wooded hill overlooking the main motorway entering the city. It is here he starts to take his revenge and is forced to go on the run.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nThis is really where the film comes alive and where you start to move towards the edge of your seat. The two policemen who are tight on his tail add depth and colour and are easily the most interesting and valuable part of the film. Innocent and naive, corrupt and selfish in equal parts the interplay between the two characters is complex and feels very real, reflecting the internal conflict of being a policeman in a politically charged city and country. One older and more senior, the other young and hungry for success, their motivations, frustrations and feelings are explored in interesting ways. The main protagonist and his journey becomes almost a sideshow compared with the interplay between these two policemen. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\nTo say any more of what happens would spoil the enjoyment of the film. It is rather difficult to get in to but ultimately worth the effort. Intimate, bleak and at times surprising, The Hunter is worth a look, despite the central character becoming less so as the film progresses. \r\n	3	2011-03-26	784	2011-03-26
789	1	16	\N	The Chronicles of Narnia - Voyage of the Dawn Treader	<p>\r\nAfter being dumped by Disney following the disappointing Prince Caspian, this latest adaptation of CS Lewis's Narnia franchise is on the rise again with Voyage of the Dawn Treader, and director Michael Apted (The World Is Not Enough) has successfully recaptured the drama and excitement of the first installment The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe. \r\n</p>\r\nThe youngest of the Pevensies, Lucy (Georgie Henley) and Edmund (Skandar Keynes) are joined by their obnoxious cousin Eustace (Will Poulter - Son of Rambow) aboard the Narnian ship The Dawn Treader, captained by new King Caspian (Ben Barnes - Dorian Gray). They are on a quest to find the seven lords banished by the false king Miraz. Along the way they face perilous dangers including an evil mist with the ability to plant seeds of doubt and paranoia in the minds of all those exposed to it. During the course of their journey they must also confront their own personal struggles, having to deal with being separated from the rest of their family and being torn between wanting to grow up or stay forever young in Narnia. \r\n</p>\r\nApted does a fine job in keeping the story interesting, although it could be argued that the film's running time is perhaps twenty minutes too long. The visual effects employed throughout are highly impressive, and ably backed up by the superb set designs and striking use of grand vistas. Using a variety of locations is clearly designed to bring back some of the magic to the Narnia series, and it's a method that works well. \r\n</p>\r\nHenley and Keynes do a decent job of portraying Lucy and Edmund Pevensie respectively, but it is the young Poulter, outstanding in the charming Son of Rambow, that truly shines as the insufferably arrogant cousin Eustace. He manages to make Eustace an instantly dislikeable character, only to redeem himself without seeming overly contrived by the film's climax. Ben Barnes also does a fine job, albeit in a far more restrained role than the previous chapter. \r\n</p>\r\n<i>Voyage of the Dawn Treader</i> is certainly a return to form for the franchise, with entertaining action scenes and the appearance of familiar characters such as Aslan providing much-needed continuity for fans of CS Lewis' epic tales. You can't help but feel, however, that it is in some of its darker elements that the film really excels, and these are still too few and far between for this franchise to compete with the likes of <i>Harry Potter</i>.  \r\n</i>. \r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	789	2011-03-26

The film stays true to the time periods from the costumes and technology relevant at the time making it believable and allowing the audience to be drawn into the setting.  \r\n</p><p>The film weaves seamlessly from past to present and the bits in between enable the audience to piece together the story and give some insight into why the love and devotion between Kenny and Betty is so strong.  However, my only criticism of this film is that there are points which are skimmed over and not really explained in depth such as the breakdown of Betty Anne's marriage.  \r\n</p><p>This film has a lot of award winning potential.  It is another moving performance from Swank who acts with such passion and emotion it is clear that she connected with the 'real life' Betty Anne.  Sam Rockwell (Iron Man 2) also plays the role of Kenny with clear dedication, striking the balance of playing a character frustrated with the justice system and a real violent streak, yet with a deep seated love and passion for his sister and baby daughter. Supporting actresses Minnie Driver, Juliette Lewis and Melissa Leo also deserve credit for delivering humble performances all of which contribute to a worthy cause and do justice to a real life story which cannot fail to move you to tears.   </p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	802	2011-03-26

806	1	12	\N	The Thorn in The Heart	<p>From Michael Gondry, the director of The Science of Sleep and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, comes this documentary of his family history told through the eyes of his Aunt Suzette.\r\n\r\n</p><p>The utter openness and honesty with which Aunt Suzette talks to the camera is only made possible through the obviously close and trusting relationship with her nephew. What is then laid bare are all emotions and memories told with warmth and melancholy in equal measure. \r\n\r\n</p><p>The film takes us on a journey to the large number of schools that Suzette had taught in throughout her life, peppering the experiences with thoughts from her sons and her pupils who are all looking much older, and often seem rather bemused to see their old school ma'am appear from the past. \r\n\r\n</p><p>This has quite a different style from his previously known, somewhat surreal and jarring, film style. This is honest and true in every sense of the word, but then there are a couple of touches of magic and quirkiness reminiscent of Eternal Sunshine.\r\n\r\n</p><p>Other than the history of the schools that his Aunt taught in, there is a thin thread that runs through the film looking at the tense relationship between Suzette and her gay son Jean-Yves. Jean-Yves also had a passion for filmmaking once, and some of his superb film is used to great effect underlining the well established role of matriarch and corner stone of the family. \r\n\r\n</p><p>Although touching, emotive and at time darkly humourous, this doesn't feel like a film Gondry made for wide release, or even wide acclaim. Much more a personal family project and therefore it feels at times quite uncomfortable to be watching. You feel like you are being allowed in to the Gondry's living room, a view on the family life and history of his family. That doesn't make it a bad film, just an intensely personal one. </p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	806	2011-03-26
813	1	27	\N	I Am Number Four	<p>\r\nI Am Number Four is a film about an exceptional teenager, John (Alex Pettyfer - Tormented) who has superhuman skills, but it is these skills that means he has to constantly stay under the radar by blending in. The reason for needing to be incognito is the fact that he's actually an alien, one of nine sent to Earth to grow, gain their skills (like young Superman), and eventually be able to protect. But apart from keeping their true identity from human-folk, they also have to avoid their evil enemy, the Mogadorians, also from their own planet, sent to destroy all nine of them, but in numerical order. The first three have been killed, therefore the evil eye is firmly on John as number four.\r\n</p><p>\r\nHe has a protector, Henri (Timothy Olyphant - Damages), and a bit like Buffy's aid, he helps him grow, learn his abilities, and more importantly keeps him on the run. Like any typical high school student, or any typical high school movie, there has to be a pretty girl that captures the eye and heart of our handsome hero to further complicate the situation. Bring in Sarah (Dianna Agron - Glee [TV]). She brings a whole bunch of baggage that doesn't help Jack stay under the radar, and not helped by the fact Jack doesn't understand the severity of his situation, believing the fight isn't his, until the demons come to town. Cue fantastic fight scenes with great guns and the odd explosion.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nAlthough almost two hours, the film kept me entertained all the way through, whether it be the good looking cast, great special effects and costumes, lovely sceneries, plus the film has some great one liners. The casting was also brilliant and very believable, resulting in very likeable characters that you can really empathise with.  \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nI saw it at the IMAX which I have to admit was a fantastic exhilarating experience. The scenery and the sweeping camera action right at the beginning was awesome, drawing you in, and making me feel very much like how I felt the first time I saw Avatar. The rest of the film was good, and I really enjoyed it, but the IMAX experience wasn't needed for the rest of the movie as it was just a regular teen flick. \r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nThe whole brooding handsome teenager having to start a new school, stay under cover while hiding a secret and falling in love with a local girl, plus having the obligatory good vs bad fight scenes, means that anyone who liked Twilight would like this. Or Jumper if you like action packed films focusing around a handsome young man with superhuman skills.\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nA fantastic action packed sci-fi.</p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	813	2011-03-26
819	1	16	\N	Just Go With It	<p>\r\nIn his younger days, Danny (Adam Sandler - Grown Ups) was a loser when it came to love. The girl he was going to marry turned out to be a cheater. Danny never made it down the aisle but still kept his wedding ring. While drowning his sorrows, he discovered that his wedding ring and failed marriage was a hit with the ladies. Not only did they feel sorry for Danny but they also didn't see him as a threat like the usual sleazes they came across.\r\n </p><p>\r\nAs Danny grew up he became a successful plastic surgeon and continued to wear his wedding ring and take advantage of the power it brought with it.  His co-worker Katherine (Jennifer Aniston - The Bounty Hunter) is appalled by how Danny lies to the women he dates but that doesn't stop him. In fact, when he meets his next love interest Palmer (Brooklyn Decker - Ugly Betty [TV]) a new plan starts to hatch and Katherine gets roped in.\r\n </p><p>\r\nPalmer discovers Danny's wedding ring and refuses to continue dating him. Katherine comes up with an idea - why doesn't Danny pretend he is in a loveless marriage and that he is finalising a divorce? Rather than admitting that he lied about being married, Danny thinks it's a perfect idea. Now all he needs is a fake wife to meet his new girlfriend. Cue Katherine aka the new and improved Mrs Maccabee who gets a makeover to transform into a plastic surgeon's soon-to-be ex wife!\r\n </p><p>\r\nKatherine has to convince Palmer that she is Danny's soon-to-be ex wife and that she gives them her blessing to date. Adding further complication, Palmer finds out about Katherine's children so Danny has to bribe Maggie and Michael to become his fake children too and play happy families!\r\n </p><p>\r\nSandler plays his usual stereotypical comedic role and is actually overshadowed by Aniston who delivers some really funny lines in the movie. Sandler's sidekick is played by Nick Swardson (The House Bunny) who is a crazy German sheep seller and Nicole Kidman (Nine) plays Katherine's ice cold nemesis Devlin. Katherine's children are also very entertaining, especially Maggie (Bailee Madison - Chase [TV]) who puts on a variety of amusing British accents.\r\n</p><p>\r\nDespite a predictable conclusion, fans of fake romance movies with happy endings like <i>The Proposal</i> will enjoy this light hearted rom-com full of plenty of laughs and antics throughout. \r\n</p>	3	2011-03-26	819	2011-03-26
821	1	4	\N	No Strings Attached	<p>\r\nDirector Ivan Reitman of Ghostbusters fame trades ghouls and ecto-plasma for bedroom antics in this rom-com No Strings Attached.\r\n</p>\r\nThe film opens with a young Adam and Emma discussing the intricacies of foreplay. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\nYears later Adam (Ashton Kutcher - Valentine's Day) and Emma (Natalie Portman - Black Swan) are reunited at a party. Adam is now a carefree budding scriptwriter and Emma is a dowdy doctor.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nAfter their chance meeting, they meet again on the street and exchange phone numbers despite Adam's current squeeze Vanessa (Orphelia Lovibond - London Boulevard) standing right beside him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nThe love triangle soon becomes a square when Adam's dad Alvin (Kevin Kline - The Conspirator) gets involved. No sooner has Adam ditched Vanessa is his dad now dating her! At least Adam is free to pursue Emma instead.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nEmma is a commitment phobe so Adam has to do a great deal of chasing and wooing to impress her. After a drunken night, Emma succumbs to his charms and the pair agree to use each other for sex and nothing more. They aren't dating, they're just 'friends with benefits'.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nThis movie is as predictable as it may sound; you know how it's going to end. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\nOn the acting front, none of the stars are particularly stretched for their roles. Kutcher is typecast as the humorous love interest and provides a nice butt shot for all the ladies out there. Portman's performance is a far cry for her Oscar winning portrayal in Black Swan. However, she does play a dipsy drunk very well!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nFans of <i>Love and Other Drugs</i> will enjoy this movie but minus the emotional element. No Strings Attached is purely as its name suggests - pure fun with no emotional ties. \r\n	2	2011-03-26	821	2011-03-26
2	1	20	A British inventor, a Chinese thief, and a French artist attempt to cross the world in eighty days	Around The World In 80 Days	<p>In the final years of the 19th century, the world was a very different place. The British empire, the largest the world had ever seen, spanned the globe and an Eccentric English Gentleman was a very charismatic image. In the Jules Verne classic, Around the World in 80 days, a respectable yet mysterious and decidedly odd gentleman by the name of Phileas Fogg accepts a wager from his fellow members of the reform club that he cannot complete one circuit of the globe within 80 days (hence the title). The book followed the adventures of Mr Fogg's butler, Passepartout who is dragged around the world facing challenges and setbacks at each turn and pursued by a detective who is convinced that Mr Fogg has robbed the Bank of England.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years there have been many on screen adaptations of the original story but now after a few brief years on the shelf the old gem has been dusted off, reworked and re-released as a kid's classic.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>Steve Coogan (24 Hour Party People) stars as Mr Phileas Fogg who in this interpretation of the story, is a bumbling inventor who forces his valets' to test out his latest inventions. Alongside Coogan, Jackie Chan (Rush Hour 2) stars as a Chinese thief posing as a valet who enters into the service of Mr Fogg so as to elude the authorities.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>During a daily visit to the Royal Society and a confrontation with the cantankerous chairman of the society, Phileas Fogg finds himself presented with a wager to travel the world in 80 days and gain a post as head of the society or fail in the task and promise never to invent again. The wager is accepted and so the adventure begins.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>The rest of the film follows the wild and amusing adventures of the two heroes as they attempt to circle the globe. However their progress is hampered by a band of desperate Chinese warriors who have a particular interest in Passepartout and his loot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The combination of Steve Coogan's eccentric wit and mannerisms with Jackie Chan's physical comedy and kung fu fighting make for a highly entertaining kids movie. This may not be cinema gold but it is good fun and harmless. A simple message about following your dreams mixed with the odd hint of danger and adventure should help capture the imagination of some children and maybe inspire them to read the book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would recommend this film for young families looking for simple laughs and good all round fun.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	2	2012-03-08

Deb is glad to have a break from her daily duties as a wife and mother and she is ready to let her hair down.</p>\r\n<p>The girls head out to a local nightclub where Alison bumps into layabout bum Ben (Seth Rogan - The 40 Year Old Virgin).  He is a chubby, curly haired couch potato but with her beer googles on Alison takes a shine to him and one thing soon leads to another. The next day these two star crossed lovers part, expecting to never see each other again.</p>\r\n<p>But unexpectedly Alison falls ill and soon learns the shocking truth that she is pregnant.  Against her better judgement, she decides to call Ben and tell him the news.  Ben is in shock but agrees to support Alison with whatever she decides to do. And so the unlikely pair decide to give their relationship a shot.</p>\r\n<p>As Alison slowly tries to adapt to being pregnant and all the bodily changes, as well as stressing about her career, Ben tries to improve himself and be a better man. The comedy is driven from the reality of these two dipolar characters as they realise their new responsibilities.</p>\r\n<p>The two leads put in superb performances as the unlucky couple.  Praise must go to Heigl for her realistic portrayal of a woman in labour while Rogan is fun and entertaining as the goof ball father-to-be.  Excellent support comes from Ben's possie of pot smoking geeks. Mann puts in a superb effort as the moany and argumentative wife while Paul Rudd (The 40 Year Old Virgin) offers great comedic support as Deb's distant husband.</p>\r\n<p>Knocked Up is a fun and entertaining comedy with some great acting and laugh out loud scenes.  It doesn't quite live up to the comedic genius of <i>The 40 Year Old Virgin</i> but it gives it a good shot and does manage to provide some good comedy whithout distracting from the realities of pregnancy.  Fans of <i>Harold and Kumar Get the Munchies</i> will appreciate the bong humour and fans of the <i>The Wedding Crashers</i> are sure to love this movie's family dynamics.</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	483	2012-03-08

Hurting and lonely the hack has trouble thinking of a new story to save his career and while convalescing in an LA park he stumbles upon a miracle. </p><p>\r\nSat beneath a statue of Beethoven a vagrant, Nathaniel (Jamie Foxx - The Kingdom), plays the most wonderful music with a tatty violin missing all but two strings. The homeless musician and the journo strike up a conversation and among the babble of the clearly talented violinist, Steve gleans that Nathaniel was once a promising member of the Julliard school of performing arts. </p><p>\r\nIntrigued by his encounter Steve starts to investigate how Nathaniel found his way from successful musical prodigy to homeless human shell. As he writes about Nathaniel the readers of the paper are similarly captivated by the story of the homeless musician. However the fame that helps Steve has an adverse affect on Nathaniel, a man with mental health problems seemingly abandoned by society. </p><p>\r\nAs Steve tries to help Nathaniel he is forced to take a look at his own life and soon realises there is no magic cure for mental health issues and not always a happy ending for those left on the streets. </p><p>\r\nThe story of The Soloist is not complex and has few twists or turns, it is the journey and the characters that make it a movie. Based on a true story, the film relies on strong performances from its two lead actors and fortunately both Robert Downey Jnr and Jamie Foxx are on top form. The former brings his light hearted yet emotional skills to the role of the journalist while the latter puts in a career best as the homeless Nathaniel. </p><p>\r\nDirector Joe Write (Atonement) once again creates a very atmospheric piece of cinema and brings out superb performances from his cast. I particularly like the fantasia-like musical interpretation moments when we get a glimpse of where the music transports Nathaniel, away from the realities surrounding him. Through music he can drown out the scary scenes that surround him and the voices within his mind that haunt him. </p><p>\r\nIf you enjoyed films such as <I>Shine</I>, <I>The Aviator</I> or <I>The Fisher King</I>, you will enjoy this drama. </p><p>\r\n	4	2011-03-26	713	2012-03-08

As we follow their journey through Rwanda, Congo, Burundi, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe and finally South Africa we gain a glimpse of the individuality and culture of each nation through colour and landscapes.</p>\r\n<p>The debut director (Debs Gardner-Paterson) is unafraid to show Africa in all its glory and misery.  The harsh realities of child soldiers and the impact of HIV and AIDS are issues which the children deal with as part of their lives, supporting each other as a team and growing in unity as they head towards their goal.</p>\r\n<p>The characters balance each other perfectly acting with ease and emotion, especially young Ndayambaje (Dudu) who plays the role with such endearing pride and energy.</p>\r\n<p>The film is fresh and reflects modern day culture. The children refer to famous footballers and managers, brand names and slogans just as children do in any playground around the world.</p>\r\n<p>The soundtrack works very well alongside the film using both well known pop songs such as the Ting Tings and traditional African songs lending authenticity and diversity to the film.</p>\r\n<p>This film has universal appeal.  It is for anyone who appreciates the courage and hope carried by children around the world to dream of a better future, a future where all African nations are united.</p>\r\n	5	2011-03-26	773	2012-03-08

Praise to Aniston for having to deal with numerous marriage references and sordid affairs during the film when having to deal with real-life marital blues in her personal life at the same time.  Costner and Aniston are an odd love match, considering the age gap, but both put in good performances in their own right.

688	1	18	"To be perfectly honest, I've had enough of being an enigma. I want to be known."	The Private Lives of Pippa Lee	<p> The main success of the film lies in its seamless integration of the different time periods of Pippa's life from her childhood right up to her present day life. The voiceover does not dominate the narrative but powerfully contributes to the psychological journey of Pippa as she explores her past and realises how it impacts her present day life. \r\n</p><p> \r\nBlake Lively (Gossip Girl [TV]) as the young Pippa Lee and Robin Wright Penn both give convincing performances and successfully portray how the character transforms from a naive rebellious spirit to the obedient Stepford wife. Praise must also be given to the supporting cast, notably Sandra Dulles (Winona Ryder - The Last Word) whose melodramatic performance adds a great sense of dramatic irony and comic effect. \r\n</p><p> \r\nOverall, this is a successful adaption of a novel and manages to capture the journey of the main character as she transcends her seemingly idyllic existence and the many lives behind her simple name. \r\n</p><p> \r\nWhile the story itself explores self discovery and the importance of being a pure sense of self, I left wanting a more complete ending. The sense of freedom from the past and an excitement for the future felt clichd and incomplete. \r\n</p><p> \r\nOverall, The Private Lives of Pippa Lee is an enjoyable film with a strong cast and wry humour, but not one that will rock your world. The real success lies with the clever work of the filmmakers who powerfully integrate the 'lives' of Pippa seamlessly so they interwine and weave a tale through past and present without disrupting the narrative or jarring the natural pace of the story. is the film adaptation of the book by Rebecca Miller. Pippa Lee (Robin Wright Penn - Beowulf) is the 50-year-old wife of the highly accomplished publicist Herb Lee (Alan Arkin - Get Smart). Pippa is initially portrayed as a devoted wife, a mother of two grown children and confidante to her friends. As the story unravels, it reveals a past which includes a drug addicted/manic depressive mother, hedonistic rebellious years fuelled with drugs, sex and alcohol, the suicide of a love rival and the story of how Pippa marries a man thirty years her senior. \r\n</p>\r\n	3	2011-03-26	688	2012-03-08

He is joined by rookie Will (Chris Pine - Star Trek) who gets easily distracted on the job. </p>\r\nAs Will learns the ropes, further along the route a runaway train is storming along the tracks. Yardmaster Connie (Rosario Dawson - Seven Pounds) is frantically trying to find a way to slow the train down or bring it to a halt safely. The deadly 'missile', carrying dangerous materials, is heading straight for the highly populated town of Stanton so Connie and her team must work fast to stop the train before it derails. </p>\r\nDaring attempts to board the train and to derail it fail miserably, leaving innocent people injured or dead in its wake. Connie is almost all out of ideas. </p>\r\nThat is until Frank & Will have a near miss with the runaway train and decide to pursue it in their own engine. Can they catch up with the runaway train and successfully slow it down? </p>\r\nWashington puts in a great performance as usual and the relationship between his character and Pine's is convincing. Dawson also puts in a fine performance as the strong and determined yardmaster. </p>\r\nAs a big fan of Tony Scott movies, his trademark camera work does conjure up the right image of a frantic and uncontrollable train on the loose. Unstoppable has the right balance of tension and action to keep you entertained.

12	1	16	Blah	Shrek 2	<p><img src="graphics/kids.gif" align="right">In the second installment of the fairytale, our loveable green ogres Shrek (voice of Mike Myers - Austin Powers) and Princess Fiona (voice of Cameron Diaz - Charlie's Angels) return from their honeymoon to begin their new life as newlyweds in Shrek's swamp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To their surprise, the couple are summoned by Fiona's parents, King (voice of John Cleese - Charlie's Angels 2) and Queen (voice of Julie Andrews - Mary Poppins) for a celebratory ball.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reluctantly Shrek heads off to meet his in-laws but not without his trusty noble stead Donkey (voice of Eddie Murphy - The Haunted Mansion) by his side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On arriving at the kingdom Far Far Away, the couple are met with a frosty reception and it is clear that Shrek and the King will never see eye to eye.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But can the King break up the "happily ever after" couple?  Under strict instructions from the Fairy Godmother (voice of Jennifer Saunders - Absolutely Fabulous), the King hires a hit man to bump off Shrek.  But who is brave enough to face up to the greenest meanest ogre who once fought a fire-breathing dragon to save Princess Fiona from her isolated tower?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shrek 2 is a hilarious sequel and much more entertaining than the first movie.  Once again Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy steal the limelight as a wise cracking team.  Other notable additions to the voice-over family are the smoldering sounds of Antonio Banderas (Zorro) as Puss in Boots, posh toff Rupert Everett (Shakespeare in Love) as the handsome Prince Charming and husky Larry King (The Stepford Wives) as the Ugly Stepsister.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After talking with friends who have seen the film, some feel the humour in this film is more direct and 'American' with less of the subtle sarcasm or irony that added an element of brilliance to the original. However everyone appears to agree that this is one really entertaining movie. A definite must-see.</p> \r\n	4	2011-03-26	14	2012-03-13
